            <p><br>
              CORA</p>
            <p> turns and makes out stilt platforms of skeletons and torn strips 
              of buckskin silhouetted against the night sky in the distance. They 
              have camped on sanctified ground, a burial place. </p>
            <p> CORA &amp; HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> She thinks it would be a mistake to ever underestimate the skill 
              of these men or the danger &amp; complexity of this place. She hands 
              the pistol back to him. Their hands almost touch.</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              (still pissed off)<br>
              &quot;We're a breed apart and we make no sense&quot; ...? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (smiles) <br>
              In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance ... </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              (sarcastic)<br>
              Thank you so much. </p>
            <p> Cora is angry. Hawkeye, staring at the trees, glances at her. 
              She settles, looking at him. Her mood changes. Then ... </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              You called Chingachgook your &quot;father&quot;? Where is your real 
              family? </p>
            <p> Hawkeye's surprised by her question.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              They buried my ma &amp; pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who 
              found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              I'm sorry. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              I do not remember them. I was one or two. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              How did you learn English? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              My father sent Uncas &amp; I to Reverend Wheelock's school when 
              I was ten. So we would know both worlds ... though <br>
              we were told only bother learning readin' &amp; arithmetic from 
              yous. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't 
              bother with? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. 
              My father's people already know each man is his own <br>
              nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No 
              man is better than any other man. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison. 
              <br>
              (changing the subject)<br>
              Why were those people living in this defenseless place ...? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So 
              after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out 
              here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's 
              leave ... <br>
              Their name was Cameron. John &amp; Alexandria.</p>
            <p> Cora sees the slate grey clouds and, in between, the fields of 
              stars. She looks at Hawkeye; then again up at the night sky. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (continuing; looking up)<br>
              My father's people say ... at the birth of the sun and of his brother, 
              the moon, their mother died ... so the sun gave to the earth <br>
              her body, from which was to spring all life. And he drew forth from 
              her breast the stars. The stars he threw into the night sky to <br>
              remind him of her soul. <br>
              (the sky)<br>
              So there is the Camerons' monument ... <br>
              my folks', too, I guess. </p>
            <p> CORA'S</p>
            <p> pensive. Hawkeye's watching her. Her reaction is enigmatic. After 
              a pause ... </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              (low)<br>
              You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. 
              And it is not as I imagined it would be, <br>
              thinking of it in Boston and London ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Sorry to disappoint you ... </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              (eyes downcast)<br>
              On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring ... to my blood ...<br>
              (then up into his eyes)<br>
              ... than any imagining could possibly have been ... </p>
            <p> She closes her eyes, turns slightly and prepares to sleep. Hawkeye 
              is the one left staring into the birch forest, a little surprised. 
              Some of his assumptions about her were wrong ... </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FOREST - WIDE - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> Deep fog has set in. A hand entering the frame scares the hell 
              out of us. It moves a branch aside. It's Uncas. Spread to the right 
              is Chingachgook, far to the left is Hawkeye. They hike up a steep 
              forested slope in the heart of the Adirondacks.</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Much further? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it. </p>
            <p> ALICE</p>
            <p> Re-energized, her spirits pick up.</p>
            <p> ALICE<br>
              Will we be able to bathe? </p>
            <p> Before Cora can answer they hear a deep, rolling roar. Alice is 
              alarmed.</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Thunder ... Papa will arrange something. </p>
            <p> UNCAS</p>
            <p> looks over his shoulder, sees something in the far distance, gestures 
              to Hawkeye and Chingachgook. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S POV: DISTANT HILLS</p>
            <p> and the band of red-painted Ottawa and Coureurs des Bois, who 
              have now split into two groups, are still on their trail. Meanwhile, 
              oblivious ...</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires 
              and provide every comfort you desire, Alice ... </p>
            <p> ALICE<br>
              Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I 
              shall. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Alice! </p>
            <p> Heyward laughs. Hawkeye sees them. It bothers us: will these Europeans, 
              including Cora, shed their frontier experience?</p>
            <p> ALICE<br>
              I can't wait to see Papa ... </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              And you, Duncan? What are you looking forward to? </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Posting to a different continent. </p>
            <p> He and Alice laugh. Cora does not.</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              I think it's very important and exciting. </p>
            <p> Heyward looks at her. She's not kidding. </p>
            <p> ANOTHER ANGLE: HEYWARD</p>
            <p> helps Alice. As he does, he stares at Cora's seperation and now 
              her proximity to Hawkeye, who's walking on ahead, is something Heyward 
              doesn't like. His dark thoughts are distracted by a FLASH of light 
              and more ROLLING THUNDER. </p>
            <p> WIDE FROM THE FRONT - HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> drops and pulls Cora to the ground.</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Lightning? </p>
            <p> Hawkeye doesn't answer as he, Chingachgook, Uncas and Heyward 
              make their way to the top of the ridge. </p>
            <p> CLOSER ANGLES: CORA &amp; ALICE</p>
            <p> join them and look down upon their expectation of a secure piece 
              of England in the wilderness, a safe harbor, a father's warm welcome. 
            </p>
            <p> THEIR POV: FORT WILLIAM HENRY</p>
            <p> is none of those things. The thunder is the roar of French siege 
              cannon clouded in dense smoke. The flashes of light are mortar bombs 
              exploding and illumination rockets' red glare. Fort William Henry 
              is under a massive siege by a French and Huron army. </p>
            <p> UNCAS</p>
            <p> looks over his shoulder. </p>
            <p> HIS POV: OTTAWA</p>
            <p> pursuing them. There's no way back. They're propelled forward. 
            </p>
            <p> DISSOLVE TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR BATTLEFIELD, FRENCH BATTERY #1 - CLOSE SHOTS - DUSK</p>
            <p> French cannons roar black smoke and gouts of red flame. </p>
            <p> TRENCH</p>
            <p> dug by sappeurs behind the cover of a huge gambio pushed toward 
              the fort by two poles and fascis on the sides. </p>
            <p> ENGLISH GUN CREW</p>
            <p> searching the night. </p>
            <p> POV: BATTLEFIELD</p>
            <p> is black. </p>
            <p> ENGLISH ROCKETS</p>
            <p> light the battlefield revealing the French trenches. </p>
            <p> ENGLISH GUN CREW</p>
            <p> excited. Colonial militia and Mohawk snipers fire their rifles. 
              The British gun crew scrambles to adjust their 18 pounders. </p>
            <p> FRENCH BATTERY #1 </p>
            <p> FIRES. </p>
            <p> FRENCH BATTERY #2</p>
            <p> FIRES. </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FORT, WEST BATTERY</p>
            <p> TRACKING. French cannon FIRE rips into the fortifications, exploding 
              wood and earth, shredding the English gun crew with cannister. The 
              English fight stubbornly, but we feel they're outgunned. Meanwhile 
              ... </p>
            <p> WIDE ANGLE FROM THE WATER</p>
            <p> A new artillery duel erupts. The action is to the west side of 
              the fort. On the north, the fire fight is reflected on the black 
              water of Lake George in our foreground. Then a dark shape wiping 
              to the right cuts off those reflections. We see in silhouette the 
              outline of a birch canoe moving silently, barely rippling the mirrored 
              surface of the lake. </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE BANK - DEBRIS</p>
            <p> Behind it, two Canadiens and a Huron alternately snipe at the 
              ramparts</p>

              EXTERIOR FOREST ABOVE CANYON &amp; FALLS - GREY WOLF - TWILIGHT</p>
            <p> watches the Hurons below make their way towards the edge of the 
              falls. </p>
            <p> OVER HIS SHOULDER: THREE MORE WOLVES</p>
            <p> join him, moving frenetically, uneasily ... The leader of the 
              pack looks up &amp; howls as his eyes go white reflecting the new 
              moon. </p>
            <p> INTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVE - HAWKEYE -NIGHT</p>
            <p> hears the distant howl. He's now lit silver blue by the moonlight 
              through the falling water. Hawkeye knows it means Hurons are out 
              there. He exchanges worried glances with Uncas &amp; Chingachgook. 
            </p>
            <p> UNCAS</p>
            <p> immediately starts up the right acclivity to one fissure, and 
              Chingachgook moves carefully to the first fissure. Hawkeye follows. 
            </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> His countenance gives way momentarily. All his experience seems 
              of no avail. He touches the side of Cora's face. Grabs Killdeer 
              and follows Chingachgook. </p>
            <p> ALICE</p>
            <p> sensing new danger, slips away on her own. </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> crosses to the Ranger who's semi-conscious, feverish and getting 
              delirious. She can't do a thing except hold his hand and think of 
              her father. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ... </p>
            <p> INTERIOR SOUTH FISSURE - HAWKEYE &amp; CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> below the edge, listen &amp; wait, testing the environment with 
              all their senses ... </p>
            <p> NORTH FISSURE - UNCAS</p>
            <p> against one wall, has his ear cocked, monitoring, facing away 
              from the sky ... </p>
            <p> ALICE</p>
            <p> looks at the sky through the fissure. She sees the starfields 
              and feels silver moonlight pull her forward. She starts out onto 
              the island, oblivious, unaware she'll expose them.<br>
              Suddenly ... </p>
            <p> UNCAS</p>
            <p> yanks her down next to him. He pulls her head into his chest, 
              looking out over the edge, his tomahawk in front of him, his musket 
              near his right hand. There is no sign she was seen. </p>
            <p> UNCAS &amp; ALICE</p>
            <p> He relaxes, looks at her and puts his finger to his lips telling 
              her to be silent. Languorously, she lies back, closes her eyes and 
              lays a hand on his shoulder, palm up, as if he were a prince in 
              a romantic fantasy. Uncas tries to restrain her. </p>
            <p> ALICE'S</p>
            <p> eyes slowly open. Oblivion disappears. It's replaced with escalating 
              fear. She holds onto Uncas with desperation. Her fingers claw his 
              shoulders. She buries her face in his chest. </p>
            <p> ALICE<br>
              Uncas ... </p>
            <p> Her body shudders. Her terror's total. He tries to restrain and 
              calm her. She won't let him. Then her mouth seeks his and in the 
              passion of despair and fear and wanting life, she holds him between 
              her thighs. And Uncas is confused, but Alice whispers his name<br>
              and he responds. He loves her in the half-light. </p>
            <p> UNCAS</p>
            <p> his hand buried in her hair irradiated by the moon, then she seems 
              to reach some emotional climax and begins to cry softly, and Uncas 
              stops making love to her and holds her. Then she's flooded with 
              shame. He reaches for her. She jerks away. He reaches for her again 
              and clutches her to him. And she breaks down. Then he turns her<br>
              face to him, but her expression has completely flattened. </p>
            <p> WIDER ANGLE</p>
            <p> She's not a lover to Uncas now. She's pitiful &amp; stricken and 
              he comforts her. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR RIVER - MAGUA - NIGHT</p>
            <p> beaches a canoe on the bank. He and eight braves ease out. His 
              war paint is fresh: green handprints on his chest and black and 
              green on his face. Black plumes are affixed to his scalp-lock and 
              his shawl is over his left shoulder. The right arm carrying his 
              musket is exposed. Many scalps are tied to his tomahawk. He walks 
              towards us<br>
              approaching the island, two hundred yards away ... </p>
            <p> CUT TO ... </p>
            <p> INTERIOR SOUTH FISSURE - HAWKEYE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> checks his powder horn. Nearly empty. He looks at Chingachgook. 
            </p>
            <p> CUT TO ... </p>
            <p> INTERIOR GLEN FALLS ISLAND, CAVE - CORA - NIGHT</p>
            <p> with the Ranger, looks up. Hawkeye enters. The look on his face. 
              Then hers. They've been discovered. Now they're backed into a hole 
              in the ground with no powder and no way out.</p>
            <p> CUT TO ... </p>
            <p> INTERIOR GLEN FALLS, CAVE - HAWKEYE &amp; CHINGACHGOOK - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Chingachgook talks to him in Mohican. Momentarily the anger and 
              frustration is seen on Hawkeye's face. All his experience &amp; 
              craft has been to no avail. He looks at Cora. Back to Chingachgook. 
              Chingachgook states something terse in Mohican. Hawkeye<br>
              agrees. Heyward's confused. He doesn't know what they're talking 
              about. Cora has understood Chingachgook's intent perfectly.</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Yes. Go ahead. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (explodes)<br>
              What the bloody hell plan is this? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (to Cora)<br>
              In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If 
              we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them. Though 
              my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I 
              can do <br>
              nothing. Do you understand? </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Yes. I want you to go. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Coward! Coward back at the fort. <br>
              Coward here. </p>
            <p> Hawkeye uses discipline not to kill the man. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              You try. With all you have. To save yourself. If the worst happens, 
              and only one of us survives, something of the other does, too ...

            <p> CUT TO ... </p>
            <p> INTERIOR NORTH FISSURE - UNCAS - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Listens. Hears. Then he inches above cover to see ... </p>
            <p> UNCAS' POV: THE RIVER &amp; SIX WAR CANOES</p>
            <p> of Hurons approach to assault the island carrying torches. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ... </p>
            <p> INTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVE - CORA &amp; HAWKEYE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> She's holding him. In the rigid language of her body is the struggle 
              to contain her fear. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (very close)<br>
              If they don't kill you, they may take you north up into Canada. 
              A warrior may take you for a wife. </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> turns aside. Hawkeye insists. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (continues)<br>
              Listen. Submit. You hear me? You're strong. You stay alive. I will 
              find you ... no matter how far, how long it takes ... </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              (nods, low)<br>
              ... never doubt what you are doing. </p>
            <p> RANGER</p>
            <p> conscious now, arranges his crushed body to face the direction 
              from which will come the attack as ... </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> puts Alice, who's entered, behind him as ... Uncas hits the floor 
              of the cave. Now the first glow from Huron torches starts to light 
              the walls. They're coming ... </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> has their weapons slung over his back. He says something in Mohican. 
              Uncas spins looks at Alice: her expression's vacant. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S KNIFE</p>
            <p> cuts a lock of Cora's hair. He folds it into his shirt. The orange 
              light from Huron torches, now closer, plays on the wall behind her. 
              We hear many Huron approach. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK &amp; UNCAS</p>
            <p> now run out of the cave and throw themselves into the curtain 
              of water. This is their exit. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> engraves her image in his memory one last time and then sprints 
              across the floor towards the water ... </p>
            <p> WHAT HAWKEYE SEES: JAMMING AT THE WATERFALL</p>
            <p> and then through it into ... </p>
            <p> SUBJECTIVE CAMERA: UP</p>
            <p> An awful crushing roar. We explode out the front of a white cataract 
              a third of the way from the top and we fall down away from the world. 
            </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR GLEN FALLS - HAWKEYE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> tumbles down the falls; rolling, tumbling through the white water; 
              then through air; then back into cascading white water again, disappearing 
              ... </p>
            <p> THE RIVER BELOW - UNCAS &amp; CHINGACHGOOK'S</p>
            <p> bodies hit, disappear and don't surface. It looks unsurviveable. 
            </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S POV: FALLING</p>
            <p> Sheets of water fall with us. The bottom races towards us at a 
              hundred miles an hour ...<br>
              Just before we hit ... </p>
            <p> CUT TO ... </p>
            <p> INTERIOR GLEN FALLS, CAVE - FLAMING TORCH - NIGHT</p>
            <p> WIDEN. The cave is filled with Hurons. The Redcoat is dead in 
              the corner. A group of braves moves away from the body of the Ranger. 
            </p>
            <p> HEYWARD'S</p>
            <p> surrounded. The women are behind him. He slashes at one Huron 
              with his sword and is clubbed down by a giant. </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> enters. His blanket, like a shawl, over his left shoulder, black 
              plumes in his hair. He's imperturbable. </p>
            <p> MAGUA'S HAND</p>
            <p> reaches out and touches Cora's hair. Cora is frozen to the spot. 
              His hand drops away from the hated Munros and as Magua turns to 
              go, he says something low in Huron and the two women are jerked 
              towards the fissures. Heyward is dragged by the arms. </p>

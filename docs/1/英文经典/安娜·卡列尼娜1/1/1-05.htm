                Stepan Arkadyevich had learned easily at school, thanks to his 
                excellent abilities, but he had been idle and mischievous, and 
                therefore was one of the lowest in his class. But in spite of 
                his habitually dissipated mode of life, his inferior grade in 
                the service, and his comparative youth, he occupied the honorable 
                and lucrative position of president of one of the government boards 
                at Moscow. This post he had received through his sister Anna's 
                husband, Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin, who held one of the most 
                important positions in the ministry to which the Moscow office 
                belonged. But if Karenin had not got his brother-in-law this berth, 
                then through a hundred other personages - brothers, sisters, cousins, 
                uncles and aunts - Stiva Oblonsky would have received this post 
                or some other like it, together with the salary of six thousand 
                absolutely needful for him, as his affairs, in spite of his wife's 
                considerable property, were in a poor state. </p>
              <p>Half Moscow and Peterburg were friends and relations of Stepan 
                Arkadyevich. He was born in the midst of those who had been, and 
                had become, the powerful ones of this world. One-third of the 
                men in the government, the older men, had been friends of his 
                father's, and had known him in pinafores; another third were his 
                intimate chums, and the remainder were friendly acquaintances. 
                Consequently the distributors of earthly blessings in the shape 
                of posts, rents, concessions and such, were all his friends, and 
                could not overlook one of their own set; and Oblonsky had no need 
                to make any special exertion to get a lucrative post. He had only 
                not to refuse things, not to show jealousy, not to be quarrelsome 
                or take offense, all of which from his characteristic good nature 
                he never did. It would have struck him as absurd if he had been 
                told that he would not get a position with the salary he required, 
                especially as he expected nothing out of the way; he only wanted 
                what the men of his own age and standing did get, and he was no 
                worse qualified for performing duties of this kind than any other 
                man. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich was not merely liked by all who knew him 
                for his good humor, his bright disposition and his unquestionable 
                honesty; in him, in his handsome, radiant figure, his sparkling 
                eyes, black hair and eyebrows, and his white and pink complexion, 
                there was something which produced a physical effect of kindliness 
                and good humor on the people who met him. `Aha! Stiva! Oblonsky! 
                The man himself!' was almost always said with a smile of delight 
                on meeting him. Even though it happened at times that after a 
                conversation with him it seemed that nothing particularly delightful 
                had happened, the next day, and the next, everyone was just as 
                delighted to meet him again. </p>
              <p> After filling for two years the post of president of one of 
                the government boards at Moscow, Stepan Arkadyevich had won the 
                respect, as well as the liking, of his fellow officials, subordinates 
                and superiors, and all who had had business with him. The principal 
                qualities in Stepan Arkadyevich which had gained him this universal 
                respect in the service consisted, in the first place, of his extreme 
                indulgence for others, founded on a consciousness of his own shortcomings; 
                secondly, of his perfect liberalism - not the liberalism he read 
                of in the papers, but the liberalism that was in his blood, in 
                virtue of which he treated all men perfectly equally and exactly 
                the same, whatever their fortune or rank might be; and thirdly 
                - the most important point - of his complete indifference to the 
                business in which he was engaged, in consequence of which he was 
                never carried away, and made no mistakes. </p>
              <p> On reaching the offices of the board Stepan Arkadyevich, escorted 
                by a deferential porter with a portfolio, went into his little 
                private room, put on his uniform, and went into the board room. 
                The clerks and officials all rose, greeting him with good-humored 
                deference. Stepan Arkadyevich moved quickly, as always, to his 
                place, shook hands with the members of the board, and sat down. 
                He made a joke or two, and talked just as much as was consistent 
                with due decorum, and began work. No one knew better than Stepan 
                Arkadyevich how to hit on that exact limit of freedom, simplicity 
                and official stiffness which is necessary for the agreeable conduct 
                of business. A secretary, with the good-humored deference common 
                to everyone in Stepan Arkadyevich's office, came up with papers, 
                and began to speak in the familiar and easy tone which had been 
                introduced by Stepan Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> `We have succeeded in getting the information from the government 
                department of Penza. Here, would you care?...' </p>
              <p> `You've got it at last?' said Stepan Arkadyevich, laying his 
                finger on the paper. `Now, gentlemen...' </p>
              <p> And the sitting of the board began. </p>
              <p> `If they but knew,' he thought, inclining his head with an important 
                air and listening to the report, `what a guilty little boy their 
                president was half an hour ago!' And his eyes were laughing during 
                the reading of the report. Till two o'clock the sitting would 
                go on without a break - then there would be an interval and luncheon. 
              </p>
              <p> It was not yet two, when the large glass doors of the board 
                room suddenly opened and someone came in. </p>
              <p> All the members of the board, sitting at the table, from below 
                the portrait of the Czar and from behind the mirror of justice, 
                delighted at any distraction, looked round at the door; but the 
                doorkeeper standing there at once drove out the intruder, and 
                closed the glass door after him. </p>
              <p> When the case had been read through, Stepan Arkadyevich got 
                up and stretched, and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the 
                times took out a cigarette, being in the board room, and went 
                into his private room. Two of his board fellows, the old veteran 
                in the service, Nikitin, and the Kammerjunker Grinevich, went 
                in with him. </p>
              <p> `We shall have time to finish after lunch,' said Stepan Arkadyevich. 
              </p>
              <p> `To be sure we shall!' said Nikitin. </p>
              <p> `A pretty sharp fellow this Fomin must be,' said Grinevich of 
                one of the persons taking part in the case they were examining. 
              </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich frowned at Grinevich's words, giving him 
                thereby to understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely, 
                and made him no reply. </p>
              <p> `Who was it who came in?' he asked the doorkeeper. </p>
              <p> `Some fellow, your excellency, sneaked in without permission 
                directly my back was turned. He was asking for you. I told him: 
                when the members come out, then...' </p>
              <p> `Where is he?' </p>
              <p> `Maybe he's gone into the passage, he was strolling here till 
                now. That's he,' said the doorkeeper, pointing to a strongly built, 
                broad shouldered man with a curly beard, who, without taking off 
                his sheepskin cap, was running lightly and rapidly up the worn 
                steps of the stone staircase. One of the officials going down 
                - a lean fellow with a portfolio - stood out of his way, looked 
                disapprovingly at the legs of the running man, and then glanced 
                inquiringly at Oblonsky. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich was standing at the top of the stairs. His 
                good-naturedly beaming face above the embroidered collar of his 
                uniform beamed more than ever when he recognized the man coming 
                up. </p>
              <p> `Why, it's actually you, Levin, at last!' he said with a friendly 
                mocking smile, gazing on the approaching man. `How is it you have 
                deigned to look me up in this den?' said Stepan Arkadyevich and, 
                not content with shaking hands, he kissed his friend. `Have you 
                been here long?' </p>
              <p> `I have just come, and very much wanted to see you,' said Levin, 
                looking about him shyly, and, at the same time, angrily and uneasily. 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, let's go into my room,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, who 
                knew his friend's sensitive and irritable shyness, and, taking 
                his arm, he drew him along, as though guiding him through dangers. 
              </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich was on familiar terms with almost all his 
                acquaintances, and called almost all of them by their Christian 
                names: old men of sixty, boys of twenty, actors, ministers, merchants 
                and adjutant generals, so that many of his intimate chums were 
                to be found at the extreme ends of the social ladder, and would 
                have been very much surprised to learn that they had, through 
                the medium of Oblonsky, something in common. He was the familiar 
                friend of everyone with whom he took a glass of champagne, and 
                he took a glass of champagne with everyone, and when in consequence 
                he met any of his disreputable chums, as he used in joke to call 
                many of his friends, in the presence of his subordinates, he well 
                knew how, with his characteristic tact, to diminish any possible 
                disagreeable impression. Levin was not a disreputable chum, but 
                Oblonsky, with his ready tact, felt that Levin fancied Oblonsky 
                might not care to show his intimacy with him before subordinates, 
                and so Stepan Arkadyevich made haste to take him off into his 
                room. </p>
              <p> Levin was almost of the same age as Oblonsky; their intimacy 
                did not rest merely on champagne. Levin had been the friend and 
                companion of his early youth. They were fond of one another in 
                spite of the difference of their characters and tastes, as friends 
                are fond of one another who have been together in early youth. 
                But in spite of this, each of them - as is often the way with 
                men who have selected careers of different kinds - though in discussion 
                he would even justify the other's career, in his heart despised 
                it. It seemed to each of them that the life he led himself was 
                the only real life, and the life led by his friend was a mere 
                phantasm. Oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at 
                the sight of Levin. How often he had seen him come up to Moscow 
                from the country where he was doing something, but what precisely 
                Stepan Arkadyevich could never quite make out, and indeed took 
                no interest in the matter. Levin arrived in Moscow always excited 
                and in a hurry, rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want 
                of ease, and for the most part with a perfectly new, unexpected 
                view of things. Stepan Arkadyevich laughed at this, and liked 
                it. In the same way Levin in his heart despised the town mode 
                of life of his friend, and his official duties, which he laughed 
                at and regarded as trifling. But the difference was that Oblonsky, 
                since he was doing the same as everyone did, laughed assuredly 
                and good-humoredly, while Levin laughed without assuredness and 
                sometimes angrily. </p>
              <p> `We have long been expecting you,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                going into his room and letting Levin's hand go as though to show 
                that here all danger was over. `I am very, very glad to see you,' 
                he went on. `Well, what now? How are you? When did you come?' 
              </p>
              <p><br>
                Levin was silent, looking at the unfamiliar faces of Oblonsky's 
                two companions, and especially at the elegant Grinevich's hands 
                - with such long white fingers, such long yellow nails, curved 
                at their end, and such huge shining studs on the shirt cuff, that 
                apparently these hands absorbed all his attention, and allowed 
                him no freedom of thought. Oblonsky noticed this at once, and 
                smiled. </p>
              <p> `Ah, to be sure, let me introduce you,' he said. `My colleagues: 
                Philip Ivanich Nikitin, Mikhail Stanislavich Grinevich' - and 
                turning to Levin - `a Zemstvo member, a modern Zemstvo man, a 
                gymnast who lifts five poods with one hand, a cattle breeder and 
                sportsman, and my friend - Constantin Dmitrievich Levin, the brother 
                of Sergei Ivanovich Koznishev.' </p>
              <p> `Delighted,' said the veteran. </p>
              <p> `I have the honor of knowing your brother, Sergei Ivanovich,' 
                said Grinevich, holding out his slender hand with its long nails. 
              </p>
              <p> Levin frowned, shook hands coldly, and at once turned to Oblonsky. 
                Though he had a great respect for his half-brother, an author 
                well known to all Russia, he could not endure it when people treated 
                him not as Constantin Levin, but as the brother of the celebrated 
                Koznishev. </p>
              <p> `No, I am no longer a Zemstvo man. I have quarreled with them 
                all, and don't go to the sessions any more,' he said, turning 
                to Oblonsky. </p>
              <p> `You've been quick about it!' said Oblonsky with a smile. `But 
                how? Why?' </p>
              <p> `It's a long story. I will tell you some time,' said Levin - 
                but began telling him at once. `Well, to put it shortly, I was 
                convinced that nothing was really done by the Zemstvo councils, 
                or ever could be,' he began, as though someone had just insulted 
                him. `On one side it's a plaything; they play at being a parliament, 
                and I'm neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement 
                in playthings; and on the other side' (he stammered) `it's a means 
                for the coterie of the district to feather their nests. Formerly 
                they did this through wardships and courts of justice, now they 
                do it through the Zemstvo - instead of taking the bribes, they 
                take the unearned salary,' he said, as hotly as though one of 
                those present had opposed his opinion. </p>
              <p> `Aha! You're in a new phase again, I see - a conservative,' 
                said Stepan Arkadyevich. `However, we can go into that later.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, later. But I had to see you,' said Levin, looking with 
                hatred at Grinevich's hand. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich gave a scarcely perceptible smile. </p>
              <p> `But you used to say you'd never wear European dress again,' 
                he said, gazing on Levin's new suit, obviously cut by a French 
                tailor. `So! I see: a new phase.' </p>
              <p> Levin suddenly blushed, not as grown men blush, slightly, without 
                being themselves aware of it, but as boys blush, feeling that 
                they are ridiculous through their shyness, and consequently ashamed 
                of it, and blushing still more, almost to the point of tears. 
                And it was so strange to see this sensible, manly face in such 
                a childish plight, that Oblonsky left off looking at him. </p>
              <p> `Oh, where shall we meet? You know I want very much to talk 
                to you,' said Levin. </p>
              <p> Oblonsky seemed to ponder. </p>
              <p> `I'll tell you what: let's go to Gurin's to lunch, and there 
                we can talk. I am free till three.' </p>
              <p> `No,' answered Levin, after an instant's thought, `I have another 
                visit to make.' </p>
              <p> `All right, then, let's dine together.' </p>
              <p> `Dine together? But I have nothing very particular - just a 
                word or two, a question; then a little chatting.' </p>
              <p> `Well, let's have your word or two right now - and we'll talk 
                it over in the course of the dinner.' </p>
              <p> `Well, it's this,' said Levin, `however - it's of no importance.' 
              </p>
              <p> His face suddenly assumed an expression of anger from the effort 
                he was making to surmount his shyness. </p>
              <p> `What are the Shcherbatskys doing? Everything as it used to 
                be?' he said. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich, who had long known that Levin was in love 
                with his sister-in-law, Kitty, gave a hardly perceptible smile, 
                and his eyes sparkled merrily. </p>
              <p> `You've said your word or two, but I can't answer in a few words, 
                because... Excuse me for just a minute....' </p>
              <p> A secretary came in, with respectful familiarity and the modest 
                consciousness, characteristic of every secretary, of superiority 
                to his chief in the knowledge of affairs; he went up to Oblonsky 
                with some papers, and began, under pretense of asking a question, 
                to explain some objection. Stepan Arkadyevich, without hearing 
                him out, laid his hand genially on the secretary's sleeve. </p>
              <p> `No, you do as I told you,' he said, smoothing his remark with 
                a smile, and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter 
                he moved away the papers, and said: `So do it that way, if you 
                please, Zakhar Nikitich.' </p>
              <p> The secretary retired in confusion. During the consultation 
                with the secretary Levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment. 
                He was standing with elbows on the back of a chair, and on his 
                face was a look of ironical attention. </p>
              <p> `I don't understand it - I don't understand it,' he said. </p>
              <p> `What don't you understand?' said Oblonsky, smiling just as 
                cheerfully, and picking up a cigarette. He expected some queer 
                outburst from Levin. </p>
              <p> `I don't understand what you are doing,' said Levin, shrugging 
                his shoulders. `How can you be serious about it?' </p>
              <p> `Why not?' </p>
              <p> `Why, because there's nothing in it.' </p>
              <p> `You think so - yet we're overwhelmed with work.' </p>
              <p> `On paper. But, there, you've a gift for it,' added Levin. </p>
              <p> `That's to say, you think there's a lack of something in me?' 
              </p>
              <p> `Perhaps so,' said Levin. `But all the same I admire your grandeur, 
                and am proud to have such a great person as a friend. You've not 
                answered my question, though,' he went on, with a desperate effort 
                looking Oblonsky straight in the face. </p>
              <p> `Oh, that's all very well. You wait a bit, and you'll come to 
                this yourself. It's very nice for you to have three thousand dessiatinas 
                in the Karazinsky district, and such muscles, and the freshness 
                of a girl of twelve; still you'll be one of us one day. Yes, as 
                to your question, there is no change, but it's a pity you've been 
                away so long.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, why so?' Levin queried, frightened. </p>
              <p> `Oh, nothing,' responded Oblonsky. `We'll talk it over. But 
                what's brought you up to town?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, we'll talk about that, too, later on,' said Levin, reddening 
                again up to his ears. </p>
              <p> `All right. I see,' said Stepan Arkadyevich. `I should ask you 
                to come to us, you know, but my wife's not quite well. But I'll 
                tell you what: if you want to see them, they're sure now to be 
                at the Zoological Gardens from four to five. Kitty skates. You 
                drive along there, and I'll come and fetch you, and we'll go and 
                dine somewhere together.' </p>
              <p> `Capital. So good-by till then.' </p>
              <p> `Now mind, you'll forget - I know you! - or rush off home to 
                the country!' Stepan Arkadyevich called out laughing. </p>
              <p> `No, truly!' </p>
              <p> And Levin went out of the room, recalling only when he was in 
                the doorway that he had forgotten to take leave of Oblonsky's 
                colleagues. </p>
              <p> `That gentleman must be a man of great energy,' said Grinevich, 
                when Levin had gone away. </p>
              <p> `Yes, my dear sir,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, nodding his head, 
                `he's a lucky fellow! Three thousand dessiatinas in the Karazinsky 
                district; everything before him; and what youth and vigor! Not 
                like some of us.' </p>
              <p> `But why are you complaining, Stepan Arkadyevich?' </p>
              <p> `Why, it goes hard with me, very bad,' said Stepan Arkadyevich 
                with a heavy sigh. </p>

              <p><br>
                Vronsky had never had a real home life. His mother had been in 
                her youth a brilliant society woman, who had had during her married 
                life, and still more afterward, many love affairs notorious in 
                the whole fashionable world. His father he scarcely remembered, 
                and he had been educated in the Corps of Pages. </p>
              <p>Leaving the school very young as a brilliant officer, he had 
                at once got into the circle of wealthy Peterburg army men. Although 
                he did go more or less into Peterburg society, his love affairs 
                had always hitherto been outside it. </p>
              <p> In Moscow he had for the first time felt, after his luxurious 
                and coarse life at Peterburg, all the charm of intimacy with a 
                sweet and innocent girl of his own rank, who cared for him. It 
                never even entered his head that there could be any harm in his 
                relations with Kitty. At balls he danced principally with her. 
                He was a constant visitor at her house. He talked to her as people 
                commonly do talk in society - all sorts of nonsense, but nonsense 
                to which he could not help attaching a special meaning in her 
                case. Although he said nothing to her that he could not have said 
                before everybody, he felt that she was becoming more and more 
                dependent upon him, and the more he felt this, the better he liked 
                it, and the tenderer was his feeling for her. He did not know 
                that this mode of behavior in relation to Kitty had a definite 
                character, that it is courting young girls with no intention of 
                marriage, and that such courting is one of the evil actions common 
                among brilliant young men such as he was. It seemed to him that 
                he was the first who had discovered this pleasure, and he was 
                enjoying his discovery. </p>
              <p> If he could have heard what her parents were saying that evening, 
                if he could have put himself at the point of view of the family, 
                and have heard that Kitty would be unhappy if he did not marry 
                her, he would have been greatly astonished, and would not have 
                believed it. He could not believe that what gave such great and 
                delicate pleasure to him, and above all to her, could be wrong. 
                Still less could he have believed that he ought to marry. </p>
              <p> Marriage had never presented itself to him as a possibility. 
                He not only disliked family life, but a family, and especially 
                a husband, in accordance with the views general in the bachelor 
                world in which he lived, were conceived as something alien, repellent, 
                and, above all, ridiculous. But though Vronsky had not the least 
                suspicion of what the parents were saying, he felt on coming away 
                from the Shcherbatsky's that the secret spiritual bond which existed 
                between him and Kitty had grown so much stronger that evening 
                that some step must be taken. But what step could and should be 
                taken he could not imagine. </p>
              <p> `What is so exquisite,' he thought, as he returned from the 
                Shcherbatsky's, carrying away with him, as he always did, a delicious 
                feeling of purity and freshness, arising partly from the fact 
                that he had not been smoking for a whole evening, and with it 
                a new feeling of tenderness at her love for him - `what is so 
                exquisite is that not a word has been said by me or by her, yet 
                we understand each other so well in this unseen language of looks 
                and tones, that this evening more clearly than ever she told me 
                she loves me. And how sweetly, simply, and most of all, how trustfully! 
                I feel myself better, purer. I feel that I have a heart, and that 
                there is a great deal of good in me Those sweet, loving eyes! 
                When she said: ``Indeed I do...''' </p>
              <p> `Well, what then? Oh, nothing. It's good for me, and good for 
                her.' And he began wondering where to finish the evening. </p>
              <p> He passed in review the places he might go to. `Club? a game 
                of bezique; champagne with Ignatov? No, I'm not going. Chateau 
                des Fleurs; there I shall find Oblonsky, songs, the cancan. No, 
                I'm sick of it. That's why I like the Shcherbatsky's, because 
                I'm growing better. I'll go home.' He went straight to his room 
                at Dussot's Hotel, ordered supper, and then undressed, and as 
                soon as his head touched the pillow, fell into a sound sleep.

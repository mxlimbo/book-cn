              <p><br>
                When they rose from the table, Levin would have liked to follow 
                Kitty into the drawing room; but he was afraid she might dislike 
                this, as too obviously paying her attention. He remained in the 
                little ring of men, taking part in the general conversation, and, 
                without looking at Kitty, he was aware of her movements, her looks, 
                and the place where she was in the drawing room. <br>
                He did at once, and without the smallest effort, keep the promise 
                he had made her - always to think well of all men, and to like 
                everyone always. The conversation fell on the village commune, 
                in which Pestsov saw a sort of special principle, called by him 
                the choral principle. Levin did not agree with Pestsov, nor with 
                his brother, who had a special attitude of his own, both admitting 
                yet not admitting the significance of the Russian commune. But 
                he talked to them, simply trying to reconcile and soften their 
                differences. He was not in the least interested in what he said 
                himself, and even less so in what they said; all he wanted was 
                that they and everyone should be happy and contented. He knew 
                now the one thing of importance; and that one thing was at first 
                there, in the drawing room, and then began moving across, and 
                came to a standstill at the door. Without turning round he felt 
                her eyes fixed on him, and her smile, and he could not help turning 
                round. She was standing in the doorway with Shcherbatsky, looking 
                at Levin. </p>
              <p> `I thought you were going toward the piano,' said he, going 
                up to her. `That's something I miss in the country - music.' </p>
              <p> `No; we only came to fetch you, and I thank you,' she said, 
                rewarding him with a smile that was like a gift, `for coming. 
                What do they want to argue for? No one ever convinces anyone, 
                you know.' </p>
              <p> `Yes; that's true,' said Levin; `it generally happens that one 
                argues warmly simply because one can't make out what one's opponent 
                wants to prove.' </p>
              <p> Levin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent 
                people that after enormous efforts, and an enormous expenditure 
                of logical subtleties and words, the disputants finally arrived 
                at the realization that what they had so long been struggling 
                to prove to one another had long ago, from the beginning of the 
                argument, been known to both, but that they liked different things, 
                and would not define what they liked for fear of its being attacked. 
                He had often had the experience of suddenly grasping in a discussion 
                what it was his opponent liked and at once liking it too, and 
                immediately he found himself agreeing, and then all arguments 
                fell away as useless. Sometimes, too, he had experienced the opposite, 
                expressing at last what he liked himself, which he was devising 
                arguments to defend, and, chancing to express it well and genuinely, 
                he had found his opponent at once agreeing and ceasing to dispute 
                his position. He tried to say this. </p>
              <p> She knit her brow, trying to understand. But directly he began 
                to illustrate his meaning, she understood at once. </p>
              <p> `I know: one must find out what he is arguing for, what is precious 
                to him, then one can...' </p>
              <p> She had completely guessed and expressed his badly expressed 
                idea. Levin smiled joyfully; he was struck by this transition 
                from the confused, verbose discussion with Pestsov and his brother 
                to this laconic, clear, almost wordless communication of the most 
                complex ideas. </p>
              <p> Shcherbatsky moved away from them, and Kitty, going up to a 
                card table, sat down, and, taking up the chalk, began drawing 
                diverging circles over the new green cloth. </p>
              <p> They began again on the subject that had been started at dinner 
                - the liberty and occupations of women. Levin was of the opinion 
                of Darya Alexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find 
                a woman's duties in a family. He supported this view by the fact 
                that no family can get on without women to help; that in every 
                family, poor or rich, there are and must be nurses, either relations 
                or hired. </p>
              <p> `No,' said Kitty, blushing, but looking at him all the more 
                bravely with her truthful eyes; `a girl may be so circumstanced 
                that she cannot live in the family without humiliation, while 
                she herself...' </p>
              <p> At the hint he understood her. </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes,' he said. `Yes, yes, yes - you're right; you're right!' 
              </p>
              <p> And he saw all that Pestsov had been maintaining at dinner about 
                the liberty of woman, simply from getting a glimpse of the terror 
                of an old maid's existence and its humiliation in Kitty's heart; 
                and loving her, he felt that terror and humiliation, and at once 
                gave up his arguments. </p>
              <p> A silence followed. She was still drawing with the chalk on 
                the table. Her eyes were shining with a soft light. Under the 
                influence of her mood he felt in all his being a continually growing 
                tension of happiness. </p>
              <p> `Ah! I've scribbled all over the table!' she said, and, laying 
                down the chalk, she made a movement as though to get up. </p>
              <p> `What! Shall I be left alone - without her?' he thought with 
                horror, and he took the chalk. `Wait a minute,' he said, sitting 
                down to the table. `I've long wanted to ask you one thing.' </p>
              <p> He looked straight into her caressing, though frightened eyes. 
              </p>
              <p> `Please, ask it.' </p>
              <p> `Here,' he said; and he wrote the initial letters, w, y, t, 
                m: i, c, n, b, d, t, m, n, o, t. These letters meant, `When you 
                told me: it could never be, did that mean never, or then?' There 
                seemed no likelihood that she could make out this complicated 
                sentence; but he looked at her as though his life depended on 
                her understanding the words. </p>
              <p> She glanced at him seriously, then leaned her puckered brow 
                on her hands and began to read. Once or twice she stole a look 
                at him, as though asking him, `Is it what I think it is?' </p>
              <p> `I understand,' she said, flushing. </p>
              <p> `What is this word?' he said, pointing to the n that stood for 
                never. </p>
              <p> `It means never,' she said; `but that's not true!' </p>
              <p> He quickly rubbed out what he had written, gave her the chalk, 
                and stood up. She wrote, t, i, c, n, a, d. </p>
              <p> Dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her 
                conversation with Alexei Alexandrovich when she caught sight of 
                the two figures: Kitty with the chalk in her hand, with a shy 
                and happy smile looking upward at Levin, and his handsome figure 
                bending over the table with glowing eyes fastened one minute on 
                the table and the next on her. He was suddenly radiant: he had 
                understood. It meant, `Then I could not answer differently.' </p>
              <p> He glanced at her questioningly, timidly. </p>
              <p> `Only then?' </p>
              <p> `Yes,' her smile answered. </p>
              <p> `And n... And now?' he asked. </p>
              <p> `Well, read this. I'll tell you what I should like - should 
                like so much!' She wrote the initial letters, i, y, c, f, a, f, 
                w, h. This meant, `If you could forget and forgive what happened.' 
              </p>
              <p> He snatched the chalk with nervous, trembling fingers, and breaking 
                it, wrote the initial letters of the following phrase, `I have 
                nothing to forget and to forgive; I have never ceased to love 
                you.' </p>
              <p> She glanced at him with a smile that did not waver. </p>
              <p> `I understand,' she said in a whisper. </p>
              <p> He sat down and wrote a long phrase. She understood it all, 
                and without asking him, `Is it this?' took the chalk and at once 
                answered. </p>
              <p> For a long while he could not understand what she had written, 
                and often looked into her eyes. He was stupefied with happiness. 
                He could not supply the words she had meant; but in her charming 
                eyes, beaming with happiness, he saw all he needed to know. And 
                he wrote three letters. But he had hardly finished writing when 
                she read them over her arm, and herself finished and wrote the 
                answer, `Yes.' </p>
              <p> `You're playing secretaire?' said the old Prince. `But we must 
                really be getting along if you want to be in time at the theater.' 
              </p>
              <p> Levin got up and escorted Kitty to the door. </p>
              <p> In their conversation everything had been said; it had been 
                said that she loved him, and that she would tell her father and 
                mother that he would come tomorrow morning. </p>

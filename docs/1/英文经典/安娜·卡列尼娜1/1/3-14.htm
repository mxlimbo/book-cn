              <p><br>
                As he neared Peterburg, Alexei Alexandrovich not only adhered 
                entirely to his decision, but was even composing in his head the 
                letter he would write to his wife. Going into the hall Alexei 
                Alexandrovich glanced at the letters and papers brought from his 
                Ministry and directed that they should be brought to him in his 
                study. </p>
              <p>`The horses can be taken out, and I will see no one,' he said 
                in answer to the porter, with a certain pleasure, indicative of 
                his agreeable frame of mind, emphasizing the words, `see no one.' 
              </p>
              <p> In his study Alexei Alexandrovich walked up and down twice, 
                and stopped at an immense writing table, on which six candles 
                had already been lighted by the valet who had preceded him. He 
                cracked his knuckles, and sat down, sorting out his writing appurtenances. 
                Putting his elbows on the table, he bent his head on one side, 
                thought a minute, and began to write, without pausing for a second. 
                He wrote without using any form of address to her, and wrote in 
                French, making use of the plural `vous,' which has not the same 
                note of coldness as the corresponding Russian form. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>`At our last conversation, I notified you of my intention of 
                communicating to you my decision in regard to the subject of that 
                conversation. Having carefully considered everything, I am writing 
                now with the object of fulfilling that promise. My decision is 
                as follows. Whatever your conduct may have been, I do not consider 
                myself justified in breaking the ties in which we are bound by 
                a Higher Power. The family cannot be broken up by a whim, a caprice, 
                or even by the sin of one of the partners in the marriage, and 
                our life must go on as it has done in the past. This is essential 
                for me, for you, and for our son. I am fully persuaded that you 
                have repented, and do repent, of what has called forth the present 
                letter, and that you will co-operate with me in eradicating the 
                cause of our estrangement, and forgetting the past. In the contrary 
                event, you can conjecture what awaits you and your son. All this 
                I hope to discuss more in detail in a personal interview. As the 
                season is drawing to a close, I would beg you to return to Peterburg 
                as quickly as possible - not later than Tuesday. All necessary 
                preparations shall be made for your arrival here. I beg you to 
                note that I attach particular significance to compliance with 
                this request. <br>
              </p>
              <p>A. Karenin<br>
                `P.S. - I enclose the money which may be needed for your expenses.'</p>
              <p>He read the letter through and felt pleased with it, and especially 
                because he had remembered to enclose money: there was not a harsh 
                word, not a reproach in it, nor was there undue indulgence. Most 
                of all, it was a golden bridge for a return. Folding the letter 
                and smoothing it with a massive ivory knife, and putting it in 
                an envelope with the money, he rang the bell with the gratification 
                it always afforded him to use the well-arranged appointments of 
                his writing table. <br>
                `Give this to a messenger to be delivered to Anna Arkadyevna tomorrow, 
                at the summer villa,' he said, getting up. </p>
              <p> `Certainly, Your Excellency; is tea to be served in the study?' 
              </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich ordered tea to be brought to the study, 
                and playing with the massive paper knife, he moved to his easy 
                chair, near which there had been placed ready for him a lamp and 
                the French work on les tables Eugubines that he had begun. Over 
                the easy chair there hung in a gold frame an oval portrait of 
                Anna, a fine painting by a celebrated artist. Alexei Alexandrovich 
                glanced at it. The unfathomable eyes gazed ironically and insolently 
                at him, as they did that night of their last explanation. Insufferably 
                insolent and challenging was the effect in Alexei Alexandrovich's 
                eyes of the black lace about the head, admirably touched in by 
                the painter, the black hair and handsome white hand the fourth 
                finger of which was covered with rings. After looking at the portrait 
                for a minute, Alexei Alexandrovich shuddered so that his lips 
                quivered and produced `brrr,' and turned away. He made haste to 
                sit down in his easy chair and opened the book. He tried to read, 
                but he could not revive the very vivid interest he had felt before 
                in Eugubine inscriptions. He looked at the book and thought of 
                something else. He thought not of his wife, but of a complication 
                that had arisen in his official life, which at the time constituted 
                the chief interest of it. He felt that he had penetrated more 
                deeply than ever before into this intricate affair, and that he 
                had originated a leading idea - he could say it without self-flattery 
                - calculated to clear up the whole business, to strengthen him 
                in his official career, to discomfit his enemies, and thereby 
                to be of the greatest benefit to the State. Directly the servant 
                had set the tea and left the room, Alexei Alexandrovich got up 
                and went to the writing table. Moving into the middle of the table 
                a portfolio of current papers, with a scarcely perceptible smile 
                of self-satisfaction, he took a pencil from a rack and plunged 
                into the perusal of a complex report relating to the present complication. 
                The complication was of this nature: Alexei Alexandrovich's characteristic 
                quality as a politician, that special individual qualification 
                that every rising functionary possesses, the qualification that 
                with his unflagging ambition, his reserve, his honesty, and his 
                self-confidence had made his career, was his contempt for red 
                tape, his cutting down of correspondence, his direct contact, 
                wherever possible, with the living fact, and his economy. It happened 
                that the famous Commission of the 2nd of June had set on foot 
                an inquiry into the irrigation of lands in the Zaraisky province, 
                which fell under Alexei Alexandrovich's department, and was a 
                glaring example of fruitless expenditure and paper reforms. Alexei 
                Alexandrovich was aware of the truth of this. The irrigation of 
                these lands in the Zaraisky province had been initiated by the 
                predecessor of Alexei Alexandrovich's predecessor. And vast sums 
                of money had actually been spent, and were still being spent, 
                on this business, and utterly unproductively, and the whole business 
                could obviously lead to nothing whatever. Alexei Alexandrovich 
                had perceived this at once on entering office, and would have 
                liked to lay hands on the business. But at first, when he did 
                not yet feel secure in his position, he knew it would affect too 
                many interests, and would be imprudent; later on he had been engrossed 
                in other questions, and had simply forgotten this case. It went 
                of itself, like all such cases, by the mere force of inertia. 
                (Many people gained their livelihood by this business, especially 
                one highly conscientious and musical family: all the daughters 
                played on stringed instruments, and Alexei Alexandrovich knew 
                the family and had stood godfather to one of the elder daughters.) 
                The raising of this question by a hostile Ministry was in Alexei 
                Alexandrovich's opinion a dishonorable proceeding, seeing that 
                in every Ministry there were things similar and worse, which no 
                one inquired into, for well-known reasons of official etiquette. 
                However, now that the gauntlet had been thrown down to him, he 
                had boldly picked it up and demanded the appointment of a special 
                commission to investigate and verify the working of the Commission 
                of Irrigation of the lands in the Zaraisky province; but in compensation 
                he gave no quarter to the enemy either. He demanded also the appointment 
                of another special commission to inquire into the question of 
                the Native Tribes Organization. The question of the Native Tribes 
                had been brought up incidentally in the Committee of the 2nd of 
                June, and had been pressed forward actively by Alexei Alexandrovich, 
                as one admitting of no delay on account of the deplorable condition 
                of the native tribes. In the Committee this question had been 
                a ground of contention between several Ministries. The Ministry 
                hostile to Alexei Alexandrovich proved that the condition of the 
                native tribes was exceedingly flourishing, that the proposed reconstruction 
                might be the ruin of their prosperity, and that if there were 
                anything wrong, it arose mainly from the failure on the part of 
                Alexei Alexandrovich's Ministry to carry out the measures prescribed 
                by law. Now Alexei Alexandrovich intended to demand: First, that 
                a new commission should be formed which should be empowered to 
                investigate the condition of the native tribes on the spot; secondly, 
                if it should appear that the condition of the native tribes actually 
                was such as it appeared to be from the official data in the hands 
                of the Committee, that another new scientific commission should 
                be appointed to investigate the deplorable condition of the native 
                tribes from the - (a) political, (b) administrative, (c) economic, 
                (d) ethnographical, (e) material, and (f ) religious points of 
                view; thirdly, that evidence should be required from the rival 
                Ministry of the measures that had been taken during the last ten 
                years by that Ministry for averting the disastrous conditions 
                in which the native tribes were now placed; and, fourthly and 
                finally, that that Ministry be asked to explain why it had, as 
                appeared from the reports submitted before the Committee, under 
                Nos. 17,015 and 18,308, dated December 5, 1863, and June 7, 1864 
                respectively, acted in direct contravention of the intention of 
                the basic and organic law, T... Statute 18, and the note to Statute 
                36. A flush of eagerness suffused the face of Alexei Alexandrovich 
                as he rapidly wrote out a synopsis of these ideas for his own 
                benefit. Having filled a sheet of paper, he got up, rang, and 
                sent a note to the head clerk to look up certain necessary facts 
                for him. Getting up and walking about the room, he glanced again 
                at the portrait, frowned, and smiled contemptuously. After reading 
                a little more of the book on Eugubine inscriptions, and renewing 
                his interest in it, Alexei Alexandrovich went to bed at eleven 
                o'clock, and recollecting as he lay in bed the incident with his 
                wife, he saw it now in by no means so gloomy a light. </p>

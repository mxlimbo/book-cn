              <p><br>
                The ball was only just beginning as Kitty and her mother walked 
                up the great staircase, flooded with light, and lined with flowers 
                and footmen in powder and red coats. From the rooms came a constant, 
                steady noise, like that of a hive aswarm; and as they were giving 
                the final little touches to hair and dresses before a mirror on 
                the landing between potted trees, they heard, coming from the 
                ballroom, the gently distinct notes of the fiddles of the orchestra, 
                beginning the first waltz. A little ancient in civilian dress, 
                arranging his gray curls before another mirror, and diffusing 
                an odor of scent, stumbled against them on the stairs, and stood 
                aside, evidently admiring Kitty, whom he did not know. A beardless 
                youth, one of those society youths whom the old Prince Shcherbatsky 
                called whelps, in an exceedingly open waistcoat, straightening 
                his white tie as he went, bowed to them and after running by, 
                came back to ask Kitty for a quadrille. As the first quadrille 
                had already been given to Vronsky, she had to promise this youth 
                the second. An officer, buttoning his glove, stood aside in the 
                doorway, and, stroking his mustache, admired the rosy Kitty. </p>
              <p>Although her dress, her coiffure, and all the preparations for 
                the ball had cost Kitty much trouble and planning, at this moment 
                she walked into the ballroom in the elaborate tulle dress over 
                a pink slip as unconcernedly and simply as though all the rosettes 
                and lace, all the minute details of her attire, had not cost her 
                or her family a moment's attention, as though she had been born 
                in this tulle and lace, with this towering coiffure, surmounted 
                by a rose and two small leaves. </p>
              <p> When, just before entering the ballroom, the old Princess tried 
                to adjust a sash ribbon that had become twisted, Kitty had drawn 
                back a little. She felt that everything must be right of itself, 
                and graceful, and that nothing could need setting straight. </p>
              <p><br>
                Kitty had one of her good days. Her dress was not uncomfortable 
                anywhere; her lace bertha did not droop anywhere; her rosettes 
                were neither crushed nor torn off; her pink slippers with high, 
                curving heels did not pinch, but gladdened her tiny feet; and 
                the thick bandeaux of fair hair kept up on her head. All the three 
                buttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered 
                her hand without concealing its lines. The black velvet ribbon 
                of her locket nestled with special tenderness round her neck. 
                This velvet ribbon was a darling; at home, regarding her neck 
                in the looking glass, Kitty had felt that that velvet was speaking. 
                About all the rest there might be a doubt, but the velvet ribbon 
                was a darling. Kitty smiled here too, at the ball, when she glanced 
                at it in the glass. Her bare shoulders and arms gave Kitty a sensation 
                of chill marble - a sensation she particularly liked. Her eyes 
                sparkled, and her rosy lips could not help but smile from the 
                consciousness of their own attractiveness. She had scarcely entered 
                the ballroom and reached the tulle-ribbon-lace-colored throng 
                of ladies, waiting to be asked to dance - Kitty was never one 
                of that throng - when she was asked for a waltz, and asked by 
                the best partner, the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom, 
                a renowned conductor of the dances and master of ceremonies, married 
                man, handsome and well built, Iegorushka Korsunsky. He had only 
                just left the Countess Banina, with whom he had danced the first 
                turn of the waltz, and, scanning his demesne - that is to say, 
                a few couples who had started dancing - he caught sight of Kitty 
                entering, and flew up to her with that peculiar, easy amble which 
                is confined to conductors of the dances. Bowing and without even 
                asking her if she cared to dance, he put out his arm to encircle 
                her slender waist. She looked round for someone to give her fan 
                to, and their hostess, smiling to her, took it. </p>
              <p> `How good of you to come in good time,' he said to her, embracing 
                her waist; `such a bad habit to be late.' </p>
              <p> Bending her left arm, she laid it on his shoulder, and her little 
                feet in their pink slippers began swiftly, lightly, and rhythmically 
                moving over the slippery floor in time to the music. </p>
              <p> `It's a rest to waltz with you,' he said to her, as they fell 
                into the first slow steps of the waltz. `It's charming - such 
                lightness, precision.' He said to her the same thing he said to 
                almost all his partners whom he knew well. </p>
              <p> She smiled at his praise, and continued to look about the room 
                over his shoulder. She was not like a girl at her first ball, 
                for whom all faces in the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland. 
                And she was not a girl who had gone the stale round of balls till 
                every face in the ballroom was familiar and tiresome. But she 
                was in the middle stage between these two; she was excited, and 
                at the same time she had sufficient self-possession to be able 
                to observe. In the left corner of the ballroom she saw the very 
                flower of society grouped together. There - impossibly naked - 
                was the beauty Liddy, Korsunsky's wife; there was the lady of 
                the house; there shone the bald pate of Krivin, always to be found 
                wherever the best people were; in that direction gazed the young 
                men, not venturing to approach; there, too, she descried Stiva, 
                and there she saw the charming figure and head of Anna in a black 
                velvet gown. And he was there. Kitty had not seen him since the 
                evening she refused Levin. With her farsighted eyes, knew him 
                at once, and was even aware that he was looking at her. </p>
              <p> `Another turn, eh? You're not tired?' said Korsunsky, a little 
                out of breath. </p>
              <p> `No, thank you!' </p>
              <p> `Where shall I take you?' </p>
              <p> `Madame Karenina's here, I think.... Take me to her.' </p>
              <p> `Wherever you command.' </p>
              <p> And Korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight toward 
                the group in the left corner, continually saying, `Pardon, mesdames, 
                pardon, pardon, mesdames,' and steering his course through the 
                sea of lace, tulle and ribbon, and not disarranging a feather, 
                he turned his partner sharply round, so that her slim ankles, 
                in light, transparent stockings, were exposed to view, and her 
                train floated out in fan shape and covered Krivin's knees. Korsunsky 
                bowed, set straight his open shirt front, and gave her his arm 
                to conduct her to Anna Arkadyevna. Kitty, flushed, took her train 
                from Krivin's knees, and, a little giddy, looked round, seeking 
                Anna. Anna was not in lilac, as Kitty had so urgently wished, 
                but in a black, low-cut, velvet gown, showing her full shoulders 
                and bosom, that looked as though carved in old ivory, and her 
                rounded arms, with tiny, slender hands. The whole gown was trimmed 
                with Venetian guipure. On her head, among her black hair - her 
                own, with no false additions - was a little wreath of pansies, 
                and a similar one on the black ribbon of her sash, among white 
                lace. Her coiffure was not striking. All that was noticeable was 
                the little willful tendrils of her curly hair that persisted in 
                escaping on the nape of her neck, and on her temples. Encircling 
                her sculptured, strong neck was a thread of pearls. </p>
              <p> Kitty had been seeing Anna every day; she adored her, and had 
                pictured her invariably in lilac. But now, seeing her in black, 
                she felt that she had not fully perceived her charm. She saw her 
                now as someone quite new and surprising to her. Now she understood 
                that Anna could not have been in lilac, and that her charm was 
                precisely in that she always stood out against her attire, that 
                her dress could never be noticeable on her. And her black dress, 
                with its sumptuous lace, was not noticeable on her; it was only 
                the frame and all that was seen was she - simple, natural, elegant, 
                and at the same time gay and animated. </p>
              <p> She was standing, as always, very erect, and when Kitty drew 
                near the group she was speaking to the master of the house, her 
                head slightly turned toward him. </p>
              <p> `No, I won't cast a stone,' she was saying, in answer to something, 
                `though I can't understand it she went on, shrugging her shoulders, 
                and she turned at once with a soft smile of protection toward 
                Kitty. With a cursory feminine glance she scanned her attire, 
                and made a movement of her head, hardly perceptible, but understood 
                by Kitty, signifying approval of her dress and her looks. `You 
                came into the room dancing,' she added. </p>
              <p> `This is one of my most faithful supporters,' said Korsunsky, 
                bowing to Anna Arkadyevna, whom he had not yet seen. `The Princess 
                helps to make any ball festive and successful. Anna Arkadyevna, 
                a waltz?' he said, bending down to her. </p>
              <p> `Why, have you met?' inquired their host. </p>
              <p> `Is there anyone we have not met? My wife and I are like white 
                wolves - everyone knows us,' answered Korsunsky. `A waltz, Anna 
                Arkadyevna?' </p>
              <p> `I don't dance whenever it's possible not to,' she said. </p>
              <p> `But tonight it's impossible,' answered Korsunsky. </p>
              <p> During the conversation Vronsky was approaching them. </p>
              <p> `Well, since it's impossible tonight, let us start,' she said, 
                not noticing Vronsky's bow, and hastily put her hand on Korsunsky's 
                shoulder. </p>
              <p> `What is she vexed with him about?' thought Kitty, discerning 
                that Anna had intentionally not responded to Vronsky's bow. Vronsky 
                went up to Kitty, reminding her of the first quadrille, and expressing 
                his regret at not having seen her all this time. Kitty gazed in 
                admiration at Anna waltzing, as she listened to him. She expected 
                him to ask her for a waltz, but he did not, and she glanced wonderingly 
                at him. He flushed, and hurriedly asked her to waltz, but he had 
                barely put his arm round her slender waist and taken the first 
                step when the music suddenly stopped. Kitty looked into his face, 
                which was so close to her own, and long afterward - for several 
                years - this look, full of love, to which he made no response, 
                cut her to the heart with an agony of shame. </p>
              <p> `Pardon! Pardon! Waltz! Waltz!' shouted Korsunsky from the other 
                side of the room, and, seizing the first young lady he came across 
                he began dancing. </p>

              <p align="center" class="h">Chapter 34</p>
              <p><br>
                Before the end of the water cure, Prince Shcherbatsky, who had 
                gone on from Carlsbad to Baden and Kissingen to Russian friends 
                - to get a breath of Russian atmosphere, as he said - came back 
                to his wife and daughter. </p>
              <p>The views of the Prince and of the Princess on life abroad were 
                completely opposed. The Princess thought everything delightful, 
                and in spite of her established position in Russian society, she 
                tried abroad to be like a European fashionable lady, which she 
                was not for the simple reason that she was a typical Russian gentlewoman; 
                and so she was affected, which did not altogether suit her. The 
                Prince, on the contrary, thought everything foreign detestable, 
                got sick of European life, kept to his Russian habits, and purposely 
                tried to show himself abroad less European than he was in reality. 
              </p>
              <p> The Prince returned thinner, with the skin hanging in loose 
                bags on his cheeks, but in the most cheerful frame of mind. His 
                good humor was even greater when he saw Kitty completely recovered. 
                The news of Kitty's friendship with Madame Stahl and Varenka, 
                and the reports the Princess gave him of some kind of change she 
                had noticed in Kitty, troubled the Prince and aroused his habitual 
                feeling of jealousy of everything that drew his daughter away 
                from him, and a dread that his daughter might have got out of 
                the reach of his influence into regions inaccessible to him. But 
                this unpleasant news was all drowned in the sea of kindliness 
                and good humor which was always within him, and more so than ever 
                since his course of Carlsbad waters. </p>
              <p> The day after his arrival the Prince, in his long overcoat, 
                with his Russian wrinkles and baggy cheeks propped up by a starched 
                collar, set off with his daughter to the spring in the greatest 
                good humor. </p>
              <p> It was a lovely morning: the tidy, cheerful houses with their 
                little gardens, the sight of the red-faced, red-armed, beer-drinking 
                German waitresses, working away merrily, and bright sun did one's 
                heart good. But the nearer they got to the springs the oftener 
                they met sick people; and their appearance seemed more pitiable 
                than ever among the everyday conditions of prosperous German life. 
                Kitty was no longer struck by this contrast. The bright sun, the 
                brilliant green of the foliage, the strains of the music were 
                for her the natural setting of all these familiar faces, with 
                their changes to greater emaciation or to convalescence, for which 
                she watched. But to the Prince the brightness and gaiety of the 
                June morning, and the sound of the orchestra playing a gay waltz 
                then in fashion, and above all, the appearance of the robust waitresses, 
                seemed something unseemly and monstrous, in conjunction with these 
                slowly moving cadavers gathered together from all parts of Europe. 
              </p>
              <p> In spite of his feeling of pride and, as it were, of the return 
                of youth, when he walked with his favorite daughter on his arm, 
                he felt awkward, and almost ashamed of his vigorous step and his 
                sturdy, stout and fat limbs. He felt almost like a man not dressed 
                in a crowd. </p>
              <p> `Present, present me to your new friends,' he said to his daughter, 
                squeezing her hand with his elbow. `I like even your horrid Soden 
                for making you so well again. Only it's melancholy, very melancholy 
                here. Who's that?' </p>
              <p> Kitty mentioned the names of all the people they met, of some 
                with whom she was acquainted, and some with whom she was not. 
                At the very entrance of the garden they met the blind lady, Madame 
                Berthe, with her guide, and the Prince was delighted to see the 
                old Frenchwoman's face light up when she heard Kitty's voice. 
                She at once began talking to him with the exaggerated politeness 
                of the French, applauding him for having such a delightful daughter, 
                extolling Kitty to the skies before her face, and calling her 
                a treasure, a pearl and a consoling angel. </p>
              <p> `Well, she's the second angel, then,' said the Prince, smiling. 
                `She calls Mademoiselle Varenka angel number one.' </p>
              <p> `Oh! Mademoiselle Varenka - she's a real angel, allez,' Madame 
                Berthe assented. </p>
              <p> In the arcade they met Varenka herself. She was walking rapidly 
                toward them, carrying an elegant red bag. </p>
              <p> `Here is papa come,' Kitty said to her. </p>
              <p> Varenka made - simply and naturally as she did everything - 
                a movement between a bow and curtsy, and immediately began talking 
                to the Prince, without shyness, naturally, as she talked to everyone. 
              </p>
              <p> `Of course I know you; I know you very well,' the Prince said 
                to her with a smile, in which Kitty detected with joy that her 
                father liked her friend. `Where are you off to in such haste?' 
              </p>
              <p> `Maman's here,' she said, turning to Kitty. `She has not slept 
                all night, and the doctor advised her to go out. I'm taking her 
                her work.' </p>
              <p> `So that's angel number one?' said the Prince when Varenka had 
                gone on. </p>
              <p> Kitty saw that her father had meant to make fun of Varenka, 
                but that he could not do it because he liked her. </p>
              <p> `Come, so we shall see all your friends,' he went on, `even 
                Madame Stahl, if she deigns to recognize me.' </p>
              <p> `Why, did you know her, papa?' Kitty asked apprehensively, catching 
                the gleam of irony that kindled in the Prince's eyes at the mention 
                of Madame Stahl. </p>
              <p> `I used to know her husband, and her too a little, before she'd 
                joined the Pietists.' </p>
              <p> `What is a Pietist, papa?' asked Kitty, dismayed to find that 
                what she prized so highly in Madame Stahl had a name. </p>
              <p> `I don't quite know myself. I only know that she thanks God 
                for everything, for every misfortune, and thanks God too that 
                her husband died. And that's rather droll, as they didn't get 
                on together. Who's that? What a piteous face!' he asked, noticing 
                a sick man of medium height sitting on a bench, wearing a brown 
                overcoat and white trousers that fell in strange folds about his 
                long, fleshless legs. This man lifted his straw hat, showed his 
                scanty curly hair and high forehead, painfully reddened by the 
                pressure of the hat. </p>
              <p> `That's Petrov, an artist,' answered Kitty blushing. `And that's 
                his wife,' she added, indicating Anna Pavlovna, who, as though 
                on purpose, at the very instant they approached, walked away after 
                a child that had run off along a path. </p>
              <p> `Poor fellow! And what a fine face he has!' said the Prince. 
                `Why don't you go up to him? He wanted to speak to you.' </p>
              <p> `Well, let us go, then,' said Kitty, turning round resolutely. 
                `How are you feeling today?' she asked Petrov. </p>
              <p> Petrov got up, leaning on his stick, and looked shyly at the 
                Prince. </p>
              <p> `This is my daughter,' said the Prince. `Let me introduce myself.' 
              </p>
              <p> The painter bowed and smiled, showing his strangely dazzling 
                white teeth. </p>
              <p> `We expected you yesterday, Princess,' he said to Kitty. </p>
              <p> He staggered as he said this, and then repeated the motion, 
                trying to make it seem as if it had been intentional. </p>
              <p> `I meant to come, but Varenka said that Anna Pavlovna sent word 
                you were not going.' </p>
              <p> `Not going!' said Petrov, blushing, and immediately beginning 
                to cough, and his eyes sought his wife. `Aneta! Aneta!' he said 
                loudly, and the swollen veins stood out like cords on his thin 
                white neck. </p>
              <p> Anna Pavlovna came up. </p>
              <p> `So you sent word to the Princess that we weren't going!' he 
                whispered to her angrily, losing his voice. </p>
              <p> `Good morning, Princess,' said Anna Pavlovna, with an assumed 
                smile utterly unlike her former manner. `Very glad to make your 
                acquaintance,' she said to the Prince. `You've long been expected, 
                Prince.' </p>
              <p> `Why did you send word to the Princess that we weren't going?' 
                the artist whispered hoarsely again, still more angrily, obviously 
                exasperated that his voice failed him so that he could not give 
                his words the expression he would have liked to. </p>
              <p> `Oh, mercy on us! I thought we weren't going,' his wife answered 
                crossly. </p>
              <p> `What, when...' He coughed and waved his hand. </p>
              <p> The Prince took off his hat and moved away with his daughter. 
              </p>
              <p> `Ah! ah!' he sighed deeply. `Oh, poor things!' </p>
              <p> `Yes, papa,' answered Kitty. `And you must know they've three 
                children, no servant, and scarcely any means. He gets something 
                from the Academy,' she went on briskly, trying to drown the distress 
                that queer change in Anna Pavlovna's manner toward her had aroused 
                in her. `Oh, here's Madame Stahl,' said Kitty, indicating an invalid 
                carriage, where, propped on pillows, something in gray and blue 
                was lying under a sunshade. This was Madame Stahl. Behind her 
                stood the gloomy, robust German workman who pushed the carriage. 
                Close by was standing a flaxen-headed Swedish Count, whom Kitty 
                knew by name. Several invalids were lingering near the low carriage, 
                staring at the lady as though she were some curiosity. </p>
              <p> The Prince walked up to her, and Kitty detected that disconcerting 
                gleam of irony in his eyes. He walked up to Madame Stahl, and 
                addressed her with extreme courtesy and charm in that excellent 
                French which so few speak nowadays. </p>
              <p> `I don't know if you remember me, but I must recall myself to 
                thank you for your kindness to my daughter,' he said taking off 
                his hat and not putting it on again. </p>
              <p> `Prince Alexandre Shcherbatsky,' said Madame Stahl, lifting 
                upon him her heavenly eyes, in which Kitty discerned a look of 
                annoyance. `Delighted! I have taken a great fancy to your daughter.' 
              </p>
              <p> `You are still in weak health?' </p>
              <p> `Yes; I'm used to it,' said Madame Stahl, and she introduced 
                the Prince to the Swedish Count. </p>
              <p> `You are scarcely changed at all,' the Prince said to her. `It's 
                ten or eleven years since I had the honor of seeing you.' </p>
              <p> `Yes; God sends the cross and sends the strength to bear it. 
                Often one wonders what is the goal of this life?... The other 
                side!' she said angrily to Varenka, who had rearranged the rug 
                over her feet not to her satisfaction. </p>
              <p> `To do good, probably,' said the Prince with a twinkle in his 
                eye. </p>
              <p> `That is not for us to judge,' said Madame Stahl, perceiving 
                the shade of expression on the Prince's face. `So you will send 
                me that book, dear Count? I'm very grateful to you,' she said 
                to the young Swede. </p>
              <p> `Ah!' cried the Prince, catching sight of the Moscow colonel 
                standing near, and with a bow to Madame Stahl he walked away with 
                his daughter and the Moscow colonel, who joined them. </p>
              <p> `That's our aristocracy, Prince!' the Moscow colonel said with 
                ironical intention. He cherished a grudge against Madame Stahl 
                for not making his acquaintance. </p>
              <p> `She's the same as ever,' replied the Prince. </p>
              <p> `Did you know her before her illness, Prince - that's to say, 
                before she took to her bed?' </p>
              <p> `Yes. She took to her bed before my eyes,' said the Prince. 
              </p>
              <p> `They say it's ten years since she has stood on her feet.' </p>
              <p> `She doesn't stand up because her legs are too short. She has 
                a very bad figure.' </p>
              <p> `Papa, it's not possible!' cried Kitty. </p>
              <p> `That's what wicked tongues say, my darling. And your Varenka 
                is to endure still,' he added. `Oh, these invalid ladies!' </p>
              <p> `Oh, no, papa!' Kitty objected warmly. `Varenka worships her. 
                And then she does so much good! Ask anyone! Everyone knows her 
                and Aline Stahl.' </p>
              <p> `Perhaps so,' said the Prince, squeezing her hand with his elbow; 
                `but it's better when one does good so that you may ask everyone 
                and no one knows.' </p>
              <p> Kitty did not answer, not because she had nothing to say, but 
                because she did not care to reveal her secret thoughts even to 
                her father. But, strange to say, although she had made up her 
                mind so firmly not to be influenced by her father's views, not 
                to let him into her inmost sanctuary, she felt that the heavenly 
                image of Madame Stahl, which she had carried for a whole month 
                in her heart, had vanished, never to return, just as the fantastic 
                figure made up of some clothes thrown down at random vanishes 
                when one sees that it is only some fallen garment. All that was 
                left was a woman with short legs, who lay down because she had 
                a bad figure, and worried patient Varenka for not arranging her 
                rug to her liking. And by no effort of her imagination could Kitty 
                bring back the former Madame Stahl. </p>

              <p><br>
                In the morning Konstantin Levin left Moscow, and toward evening 
                he reached home. On the journey in the train he talked to his 
                fellow travelers about politics and the new railways, and, just 
                as in Moscow, he was overcome by a sense of confusion of ideas, 
                by dissatisfaction with himself, and shame of something or other. 
                But when he got out at his own station, when he saw his one-eyed 
                coachman Ignat, with the collar of his coat turned up; when, in 
                the dim light falling through the station windows, he saw his 
                own carpeted sledge, his own horses with their tails up, in their 
                harness trimmed with rings and tassels; when the coachman Ignat, 
                as he put in his luggage, told him the village news - that the 
                contractor had arrived, and that Pava had calved - he felt that 
                little by little the confusion was clearing up, and the shame 
                and self-dissatisfaction were passing away. He felt this at the 
                mere sight of Ignat and the horses; but he began to see what had 
                happened to him in quite a different light, when he had put on 
                the sheepskin coat brought for him, and, all muffled up, had taken 
                his seat in the sleigh and started off, pondering on the work 
                that lay before him in the village, and staring at the off horse, 
                that had been formerly his saddle horse, overridden, but a spirited 
                animal from the Don. He felt himself, and did not want to be anyone 
                else. All he wanted now was to be better than before. In the first 
                place, he resolved that from that day on he would give up hoping 
                for the extraordinary happiness which the marriage was to afford 
                him, and consequently he would not disdain the present so. In 
                the second place, he would never again let himself give way to 
                low passion, the memory of which had so tortured him when he had 
                been making up his mind to propose. Then, remembering his brother 
                Nikolai, he resolved that he would never allow himself to forget 
                him, that he would watch him, and not lose sight of him, so as 
                to be ready to help should things go ill with him. And that would 
                be soon, he felt. Then, too, his brother's talk of communism, 
                which he had treated so lightly at the time, now made him reflect. 
                He considered an alteration in economic conditions nonsense; yet 
                he had always felt the injustice of his own abundance in comparison 
                with the poverty of the common folk, and he now determined that, 
                in order to feel quite in the right, though he had worked hard 
                and lived by no means luxuriously before, he would now work still 
                harder, and would allow himself even less luxury. And all this 
                seemed to him so easy a conquest over himself that he spent the 
                whole drive in most pleasant reveries. With a lively feeling of 
                hope in a new, better life, he drove up to his house about nine 
                o'clock at night. </p>
              <p>The snow of the little quadrangle before the house was lit up 
                by light falling from the windows in the room of his old nurse, 
                Agathya Mikhailovna, who performed the duties of housekeeper in 
                his house. She was not yet asleep. Kouzma, awakened by her, sleepy 
                and barefooted, ran out onto the steps. A setter bitch, Laska, 
                leaped out too, almost upsetting Kouzma, and whining, rubbed against 
                Levin's knees, jumping up and longing, yet not daring, to put 
                her forepaws on his chest. </p>
              <p> `You're soon returned, my dear,' said Agathya Mikhailovna. </p>
              <p> `I grew homesick, Agathya Mikhailovna. East or West, home is 
                best,' he answered, and went into his study. </p>
              <p> The study was gradually lit up as the candle was brought in. 
                The familiar details came out: the stag's horns; the bookshelves; 
                the plain stove with its warm-hole, which had long wanted mending; 
                his father's sofa, a large table, and, on the table, an open book, 
                a broken ash tray, a notebook with his handwriting. As he saw 
                all this, there came over him for an instant a doubt of the possibility 
                of arranging the new life, of which he had been dreaming on the 
                road. All these traces of his life seemed to clutch him, and to 
                say to him: `No, you're not going to get away from us, and you're 
                not going to be different - but you're going to be the same as 
                you've always been: with doubts, everlasting dissatisfaction with 
                yourself, vain efforts to amend, and lapses, and everlasting expectation 
                of a happiness which you won't get, and which isn't possible for 
                you.' </p>
              <p> But it was his things that said this to him, while another voice 
                in his heart was telling him that he must not fall under the sway 
                of the past, and that one can do anything with oneself. And hearing 
                that voice, he went into the corner where stood his two dumbbells, 
                of one pood each, and began jerking and pushing them up, trying 
                to induce a state of well-being. There was a creak of steps at 
                the door. He hastily put down the dumbbells. </p>
              <p> The bailiff came in, and said that everything, thank God, was 
                well, but also informed him that the buckwheat in the new drying 
                machine had been a little scorched. This piece of news irritated 
                Levin. The new drying machine had been constructed and partly 
                invented by Levin. The bailiff had always been against this drying 
                machine, and now it was with suppressed triumph that he announced 
                that the buckwheat had been scorched. Levin was firmly convinced 
                that if the buckwheat had been scorched it was only because precautions 
                had not been taken, for which he had hundreds of times given orders. 
                He was annoyed, and reprimanded the bailiff. But there had been 
                an important and joyful event: Pava, his best cow, an expensive 
                beast, bought at a show, had calved. </p>
              <p> `Kouzma, give me my sheepskin coat. And you, do tell them to 
                fetch a lantern - I'm going to have a look at her,' he said to 
                the bailiff. </p>
              <p> The cowhouse for the more valuable cows was just behind the 
                house. Walking across the yard, passing a snowdrift by the lilac 
                tree, he went into the cowhouse. There came a warm, steamy smell 
                of dung when the frozen door was opened, and the cows, astonished 
                at the unfamiliar light of the lantern, stirred on their fresh 
                straw. He caught a glimpse of the broad, smooth, black and piebald 
                back of a Dutch cow. Berkoot, the bull, was lying down with his 
                ring in his lip, and seemed about to get up, but thought better 
                of it, and only gave two snorts as they passed by him. Pava, the 
                reddish beauty, huge as a hippopotamus, with her back turned to 
                them, screened her calf from the arrivals and sniffed it all over. 
              </p>
              <p> Levin went into the stall, looked Pava over, and hefted the 
                reddish and red-dappled calf up on its unsteady, spindly legs. 
                Pava, uneasy, began lowing, but when Levin put the calf close 
                to her she was soothed, and, sighing heavily, began licking her 
                with her rough tongue. The calf fumbling, poked its nose under 
                its mother's groin, and twirled its tiny tail. </p>
              <p> `Bring the light here, Fiodor - bring the lantern here,' said 
                Levin, examining the heifer. `Like the dam! though the color takes 
                after the sire. A perfect beauty! Long, and broad in the haunch. 
                Isn't she a beauty now, Vassilii Fiodorovich?' he addressed the 
                bailiff, quite forgiving him for the buckwheat under the influence 
                of his delight in the heifer. </p>
              <p> `What bad blood could she take after? - Semion the contractor 
                came the day after you left. You must settle with him, Konstantin 
                Dmitrich,' said the bailiff. `And I have already told you about 
                the machine.' </p>
              <p> This matter alone was enough to bring Levin back to all the 
                details of his estate, which was on a large scale, and complicated. 
                He went straight from the cowhouse to the countinghouse, and, 
                after a short talk with the bailiff and Semion the contractor, 
                he went back to the house and straight upstairs to the drawing 
                room. </p>

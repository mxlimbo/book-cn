                It was past five, and several guests had already arrived, before 
                the host himself got home. He went in together with Sergei Ivanovich 
                Koznishev and with Pestsov, both of whom had reached the street 
                door at the same moment. These were the two leading representatives 
                of the Moscow intellectuals, as Oblonsky had called them. Both 
                were men respected for their character and their intelligence. 
                They respected each other, but were in complete and hopeless disagreement 
                upon almost every subject, not because they belonged to opposite 
                parties, but precisely because they were of the same party (their 
                enemies refused to see any distinction between their views); but, 
                in that party, each had his own special shade of opinion. And 
                since no difference is less easily overcome than the difference 
                of opinion about semiabstract questions, they never agreed on 
                any opinion, and, indeed, had long been accustomed to jeer without 
                anger at each other's incorrigible aberrations. </p>
              <p>They were just going in at the door, talking of the weather, 
                when Stepan Arkadyevich overtook them. In the drawing room there 
                were already sitting Prince Alexander Dmitrievich Shcherbatsky, 
                young Shcherbatsky, Turovtsin, Kitty, and Karenin. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich saw immediately that things were not going 
                well in the drawing room without him. Darya Alexandrovna, in her 
                best gray silk gown, obviously worried about the children who 
                were to have their dinner by themselves in the nursery, and by 
                her husband's absence, was not equal to the task of making the 
                party mix without him. All were sitting like so many priests' 
                daughters on a visit (so the old Prince expressed it), obviously 
                wondering why they were there, and pumping up remarks simply to 
                avoid being silent. Turovtsin - goodhearted man - felt unmistakably 
                like a fish out of water, and the smile with which his thick lips 
                greeted Stepan Arkadyevich said, as plainly as words: `Well, old 
                boy, you have popped me down in a learned set! A drinking party, 
                and the Chateau des Fleurs, would be more in my line!' The old 
                Prince sat in silence, his bright little eyes watching Karenin 
                with a sidelong look; and Stepan Arkadyevich saw that he had already 
                formed a sharp remark to sum up that politician of whom guests 
                had been invited to partake, as though he were a sturgeon. Kitty 
                was looking at the door, calling up all her energies to keep her 
                from blushing at the entrance of Konstantin Levin. Young Shcherbatsky, 
                who had not been introduced to Karenin, was trying to look as 
                though he were not in the least embarrassed by it. Karenin himself 
                had followed the Peterburg. etiquette for a dinner with ladies 
                present and was wearing evening dress and a white tie. Stepan 
                Arkadyevich saw by his face that he had come simply to keep his 
                promise, and was performing a disagreeable duty in being present 
                at this gathering. He was indeed the person chiefly responsible 
                for the chill benumbing all the guests before Stepan Arkadyevich 
                came in. </p>
              <p> On entering the drawing room Stepan Arkadyevich apologized, 
                explaining that he had been detained by that Prince who was always 
                the scapegoat for all his absences and unpunctualities, and in 
                one moment he had made all the guests acquainted with each other, 
                and, bringing together Alexei Alexandrovich and Sergei Koznishev, 
                had started them on a discussion of the Russification of Poland, 
                into which they immediately plunged with Pestsov. Slapping Turovtsin 
                on the shoulder, he whispered something comic in his ear, and 
                set him down by his wife and the old Prince. Then he told Kitty 
                she was looking very pretty that evening, and presented Shcherbatsky 
                to Karenin. In a moment he had so kneaded together the social 
                dough that the drawing room became very lively, and there was 
                a merry buzz of voices. Konstantin Levin was the only person who 
                had not arrived. But this was so much the better, as, going into 
                the dining room, Stepan Arkadyevich found to his horror that the 
                port and sherry had been procured from Depre, and not from Leve, 
                and, directing that the coachman should be sent off as speedily 
                as possible to Leve's he started back to the drawing room. </p>
              <p> In the dining room he was met by Konstantin Levin. </p>
              <p> `I'm not late?' </p>
              <p> `You can never help being late!' said Stepan Arkadyevich, taking 
                his arm. </p>
              <p> `Have you a lot of people? Who's here?' asked Levin, unable 
                to help blushing, as he knocked the snow off his cap with his 
                glove. </p>
              <p> `All our own set. Kitty's here. Come along, I'll introduce you 
                to Karenin.' </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich, for all his liberal views, was well aware 
                that to meet Karenin was sure to be felt a flattering distinction, 
                and so treated his best friends to this honor. But at that instant 
                Konstantin Levin was not in a condition to feel all the gratification 
                of making such an acquaintance. He had not seen Kitty since that 
                memorable evening when he met Vronsky - not counting, that is, 
                the moment when he had had a glimpse of her on the highroad. He 
                had known at the bottom of his heart that he would see her here 
                today. But, to keep his thoughts free, he had tried to persuade 
                himself that he did not know it. Now when he heard that she was 
                here, he was suddenly conscious of such delight, and at the same 
                time of such dread, that his breath failed him and he could not 
                utter what he wanted to say. </p>
              <p> `What is she like, what is she like? As she used to be, or as 
                she was in the carriage? What if Darya Alexandrovna told the truth? 
                Why shouldn't it be the truth?' he thought. </p>
              <p> `Oh, please, introduce me to Karenin,' he brought out with an 
                effort, and with a desperately determined step he walked into 
                the drawing room and beheld her. </p>
              <p> She was not the same as she used to be, nor was she as she had 
                been in the carriage; she was quite different. </p>
              <p> She was scared, shy, shamefaced, and because of all this, still 
                more charming. She saw him the very instant he walked into the 
                room. She had been expecting him. She was delighted, and so confused 
                at her own delight that there was a moment, the moment when he 
                went up to her sister and glanced again at her, when she, and 
                he, and Dolly, who saw it all, thought she would break down and 
                begin to cry. She crimsoned, turned white, crimsoned again, and 
                grew faint, waiting with quivering lips for him to come to her. 
                He went up to her, bowed, and held out his hand without speaking. 
                Except for the slight quiver of her lips and the moisture in her 
                eyes, making them brighter, her smile was almost calm as she said: 
              </p>
              <p> `How long it is since we've seen each other!' and, with desperate 
                determination, with her cold hand squeezed his. </p>
              <p> `You've not seen me, but I've seen you,' said Levin, with a 
                radiant smile of happiness. `I saw you when you were driving from 
                the railway station to Ergushovo.' </p>
              <p> `When?' she asked, wondering. </p>
              <p> `You were driving to Ergushovo,' said Levin, feeling as if he 
                would sob with the rapture that was flooding his heart. - `And 
                how dared I associate a thought of anything not innocent with 
                this touching creature? And, yes, I do believe what Darya Alexandrovna 
                told me is true,' he thought. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich took him by the arm and led him away to Karenin. 
              </p>
              <p> `Let me introduce you.' He mentioned their names. </p>
              <p> `Very glad to meet you again,' said Alexei Alexandrovich coldly, 
                shaking hands with Levin. </p>
              <p> `You are acquainted?' Stepan Arkadyevich asked in surprise. 
              </p>
              <p> `We spent three hours together in the train,' said Levin smiling, 
                `but got out, just as in a masquerade, quite mystified - at least 
                I was.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, so that's it! Come along, please,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                pointing in the direction of the dining room. </p>
              <p> The men went into the dining room and went up to the table for 
                hors d'oeuvres, laid with six sorts of vodka and as many kinds 
                of cheese, some with little silver spades and some without, caviar, 
                herrings, preserves of various kinds, and plates with slices of 
                French bread. </p>
              <p> The men stood round the strong-smelling spirits and salt delicacies, 
                and the discussion of the Russification of Poland between Koznishev, 
                Karenin and Pestsov, died down in anticipation of dinner. </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich was unequaled in his skill in winding up the 
                most heated and serious argument by some unexpected pinch of Attic 
                salt that changed the disposition of his opponent. He did this 
                now. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich had been maintaining that the Russification 
                of Poland could only be accomplished as a result of greater principles, 
                which ought to be introduced by the Russian government. </p>
              <p> Pestsov insisted that one country can absorb another only when 
                it is the more densely populated. </p>
              <p> Koznishev admitted both points, but with limitations. As they 
                were going out of the drawing room to conclude the argument, Koznishev 
                said smiling: </p>
              <p> `So, then, for the Russification of our foreign populations 
                there is but one method - to bring up as many children as one 
                can. My brother and I are terribly at fault, I see. You married 
                men - especially you, Stepan Arkadyevich - are the real patriots: 
                what number have you reached?' he said, smiling genially at their 
                host and holding out a tiny wineglass to him. </p>
              <p> Everyone laughed, and Stepan Arkadyevich with particular good 
                humor. </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes, that's the best method!' he said, munching cheese 
                and filling the wineglass with a special sort of vodka. The conversation 
                dropped at the jest. </p>
              <p> `This cheese is not bad. Shall I give you some?' said the master 
                of the house. `Why, have you been going in for gymnastics again?' 
                he asked Levin, pinching his muscle with his left hand. Levin 
                smiled, bent his arm, and under Stepan Arkadyevich's fingers the 
                muscles swelled up like a sound cheese, hard as a knob of iron, 
                through the fine cloth of the coat. </p>
              <p> `What biceps! A perfect Samson!' </p>
              <p> `I imagine great strength is needed for hunting bears,' observed 
                Alexei Alexandrovich, who had the mistiest notions about the chase. 
                He cut off and spread with cheese a wafer of bread fine as a spiderweb. 
              </p>
              <p> Levin smiled. </p>
              <p> `Not at all. Quite the contrary - a child can kill a bear,' 
                he said, with a slight bow moving aside for the ladies, who were 
                approaching the hors d'oeuvres table. </p>
              <p> `You have killed a bear, I've been told!' said Kitty, trying 
                assiduously to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would 
                slip away, and shaking the lace over her white arm. `Are there 
                bears on your place?' she added, turning her charming little head 
                to him and smiling. </p>
              <p> There was apparently nothing extraordinary in what she said, 
                but what unutterable meaning there was for him in every sound, 
                in every turn of her lips, her eyes, her hand as she said it! 
                There was entreaty for forgiveness, and trust in him, and tenderness 
                - soft, timid tenderness - and promise, and hope, and love for 
                him, which he could not but believe in, and which suffocated him 
                with happiness. </p>
              <p> `No, we've been hunting in the Tver province. It was coming 
                back from there that I met your beau-frere in the train, or your 
                beau-frere's brother-in-law,' he said with a smile. `It was an 
                amusing meeting.' </p>
              <p> And he began telling with droll good humor how, after not sleeping 
                all night, he had, wearing a fur-lined, full-skirted coat, got 
                into Alexei Alexandrovich's compartment. </p>
              <p> `The conductor, forgetting the proverb, would have chucked me 
                out on account of my attire; but thereupon I began expressing 
                my feelings in elevated language, and... you, too,' he said, addressing 
                Karenin and forgetting his name, `at first would have ejected 
                me on the ground of my coat, but afterward you took my part, for 
                which I am extremely grateful.' </p>
              <p> `The rights of passengers generally to choose their seats are 
                too ill-defined,' said Alexei Alexandrovich, rubbing the tips 
                of his fingers on his handkerchief. </p>
              <p> `I saw you were in uncertainty about me,' said Levin, smiling 
                good-naturedly, `but I made haste to plunge into intellectual 
                conversation to smooth over the defects of my attire.' </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich, while he kept a conversation with their hostess, 
                had one ear for his brother, and he glanced askance at him. `What 
                is the matter with him today? Why such a conquering hero?' he 
                thought. He did not know that Levin was feeling as though he had 
                grown wings. Levin knew she was listening to his words and that 
                she was glad to listen to him. And this was the only thing that 
                interested him. Not in that room only, but in the whole world, 
                there existed for him only himself, with enormously increased 
                importance and dignity in his own eyes, and she. He felt himself 
                on a pinnacle that made him giddy, and far away down below were 
                all those kind, excellent Karenins, Oblonskys, and all the world. 
              </p>
              <p> Quite without attracting notice, without glancing at them, as 
                though there were no other places left, Stepan Arkadyevich put 
                Levin and Kitty side by side. </p>
              <p> `Oh, you may as well sit there,' he said to Levin. </p>
              <p> The dinner was as choice as the china, of which Stepan Arkadyevich 
                was a connoisseur. The soupe Marie-Louise was a splendid success; 
                the tiny patties eaten with it melted in the mouth and were irreproachable. 
                The two footmen and Matvei, in white cravats, did their duty with 
                the dishes and wines unobtrusively, quietly, and dexterously. 
                On the material side the dinner was a success; it was no less 
                so on the immaterial. The conversation, at times general and at 
                times between individuals, never paused, and toward the end the 
                company was so lively that the men rose from the table without 
                stopping speaking, and even Alexei Alexandrovich became lively.

              <p><br>
                After dinner, and till the beginning of the evening, Kitty was 
                experiencing a sensation akin to that of a young man before a 
                battle. Her heart throbbed violently, and her thoughts would not 
                rest on anything. </p>
              <p>She felt that this evening, when both these men would meet for 
                the first time, would be a turning point in her life. And she 
                was continually picturing them to herself, at one moment each 
                individually, and then both together. When she mused on the past, 
                she dwelt with pleasure, with tenderness, on the memories of her 
                relations with Levin. The memories of childhood and of Levin's 
                friendship with her dead brother have a special poetic charm to 
                her relations with him. His love for her, of which she felt certain, 
                was flattering and delightful to her; and it was easy for her 
                to think of Levin. In her memories of Vronsky there always entered 
                a certain element of awkwardness, though he was in the highest 
                degree a fashionable and even-tempered man, as though there were 
                some false note - not in Vronsky, he was very simple and charming 
                - but in herself; while with Levin she felt herself perfectly 
                simple and clear. But, on the other hand, directly she thought 
                of the future with Vronsky, there arose before her a perspective 
                of brilliant happiness; with Levin the future seemed misty. </p>
              <p> When she went upstairs to dress, and looked into the looking 
                glass, she noticed with joy that it was one of her good days, 
                and that she was in complete possession of all her forces - she 
                needed this so for what lay before her: she was conscious of external 
                composure and free grace in her movements. </p>
              <p> At half-past seven she had only just gone down into the drawing 
                room, when the footman announced, `Constantin Dmitrievich Levin.' 
                The Princess was still in her room, and the Prince had not come 
                in. `So it is to be,' thought Kitty, and all the blood seemed 
                to rush to her heart. She was horrified at her paleness, as she 
                glanced into the looking glass. </p>
              <p> At that moment she knew beyond doubt that he had come early 
                on purpose to find her alone and to propose to her. And only then 
                for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new, 
                different aspect; only then she realized that the question did 
                not affect her only - with whom she would be happy, and whom she 
                loved - but that she would have that moment to wound a man whom 
                she liked. And to wound him cruelly... Wherefore? Because he, 
                dear fellow, loved her, was in love with her. But there was no 
                help for it; it must be so - it would have to be so. </p>
              <p> `My God! shall I myself really have to say it to him?' she thought. 
                `Can I tell him I don't love him? That will be a lie. What am 
                I to say to him? That I love someone else? No, that's impossible. 
                I'm going away - I'm going away.' </p>
              <p> She had reached the door, when she heard his step. `No It's 
                not honest. What have I to be afraid of? I have done nothing wrong. 
                What is to be, will be! I'll tell the truth. And with him one 
                can't be ill at ease. Here he is,' she said to herself, seeing 
                his powerful and timid figure, with his shining eyes fixed on 
                her. She looked straight into his face, as though imploring him 
                to spare her, and gave him her hand. </p>
              <p> `It's not time yet; I think I'm too early,' he said glancing 
                round the empty drawing room. When he saw that his expectations 
                were realized, that there was nothing to prevent him from speaking, 
                his face became somber. </p>
              <p> `Oh, no,' said Kitty, and sat down at a table. </p>
              <p> `But this was just what I wanted, to find you alone,' he began, 
                without sitting down, and not looking at her, so as not to lose 
                courage. </p>
              <p> `Mamma will be down directly. She was very much tired yesterday. 
                Yesterday...' </p>
              <p> She talked on, not knowing what her lips were uttering, and 
                not taking her supplicating and caressing eyes off him. </p>
              <p> He glanced at her; she blushed, and ceased speaking. </p>
              <p> `I told you I did not know whether I should be here long... 
                that it depended on you...' </p>
              <p> She dropped her head lower and lower, not knowing herself what 
                answer she should make to what was coming. </p>
              <p> `That it depended on you,' he repeated. `I meant to say... I 
                meant to say... I came for this... To have you be my wife!' he 
                blurted out, not knowing what he was saying, but feeling that 
                the most terrible thing was said, he stopped short and looked 
                at her. </p>
              <p> She was breathing heavily, without looking at him. She was feeling 
                ecstasy. Her soul was flooded with happiness. She had never anticipated 
                that his utterance of love would produce such a powerful effect 
                on her. But it lasted only an instant. She remembered Vronsky. 
                She lifted her clear, truthful eyes, and, seeing Levin's desperate 
                face, she answered hastily: </p>
              <p> `That cannot be... Forgive me.' </p>
              <p> A moment ago, and how close she had been to him, of what importance 
                in his life! And how aloof and remote from him she had become 
                now! </p>
              <p> `It could not have been otherwise,' he said, without looking 
                at her. He bowed, and was about to leave. </p>

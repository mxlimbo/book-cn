              <p><br>
                Stepan Arkadyevich had gone to Peterburg to perform the most natural 
                and essential official duty - so familiar to everyone in the government 
                service, though incomprehensible to outsiders - that duty but 
                for which one could hardly be in government service: of reminding 
                the ministry of his existence; and having, for the due performance 
                of this rite, taken all the available cash from home, was gaily 
                and agreeably spending his days at the races and in the summer 
                villas. Meanwhile Dolly and the children had moved into the country, 
                to cut down expenses as much as possible. She had gone to Ergushovo, 
                the estate that had been her dowry, and the one where in spring 
                the forest had been sold. It was nearly fifty verstas from Levin's 
                Pokrovskoe. </p>
              <p>The big old house at Ergushovo had been pulled down long ago, 
                and the old Prince had had the wing done up and added to. Twenty 
                years before, when Dolly was a child, the wing had been roomy 
                and comfortable, though, like all wings, it stood sideways to 
                the entrance avenue, and to the south. But by now this wing was 
                old and dilapidated. When Stepan Arkadyevich had gone down in 
                the spring to sell the forest, Dolly had begged him to look over 
                the house and order what repairs might be needed. Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                like an unfaithful husbands indeed, was very solicitous for his 
                wife's comfort, and he had himself looked over the house, and 
                given instructions about everything that he considered necessary. 
                What he considered necessary was to cover all the furniture with 
                new cretonne, to put up curtains, to weed the garden, to make 
                a little bridge on the pond, and to plant flowers. But he forgot 
                many other essential matters, the want of which greatly distressed 
                Darya Alexandrovna later on. </p>
              <p> In spite of Stepan Arkadyevich's efforts to be an attentive 
                father and husband, he never could keep in his mind that he had 
                a wife and children. He had bachelor tastes, and it was in accordance 
                with them that he shaped his life. On his return to Moscow he 
                informed his wife with pride that everything was ready, that the 
                house would be a pretty toy, and that he most certainly advised 
                her to go. His wife's staying away in the country was very agreeable 
                to Stepan Arkadyevich from every point of view: it did the children 
                good, it decreased expenses, and it left him more at liberty. 
                Darya Alexandrovna regarded staying in the country for the summer 
                as essential for the children, especially for the little girl, 
                who had not succeeded in regaining her strength after the scarlatina, 
                and also as a means of escaping the petty humiliations, the little 
                bills owing to the wood merchant, the fishmonger, the shoemaker, 
                which made her miserable. Besides this, she was pleased to go 
                away to the country because she was dreaming of getting her sister 
                Kitty to stay with her there. Kitty was to be back from abroad 
                in the middle of the summer, and bathing had been prescribed for 
                her. Kitty wrote that no prospect was so alluring as to spend 
                the summer with Dolly at Ergushovo, full of childhood associations 
                for both of them. </p>
              <p> The first days of her existence in the country were very hard 
                for Dolly. She used to stay in the country as a child, and the 
                impression she had retained of it was that the country was a refuge 
                from all the unpleasantness of the town, that life there, though 
                not luxurious - Dolly could easily make up her mind to that - 
                was cheap and comfortable; that there was plenty of everything, 
                everything was cheap, everything could be got, and children were 
                happy. But now, coming to the country as the head of a family, 
                she perceived that it was all utterly unlike what she had fancied. 
              </p>
              <p> The day after their arrival there was a heavy fall of rain and 
                in the night the water came through in the corridor and in the 
                nursery, so that the beds had to be carried into the drawing room. 
                There was no kitchenmaid to be found; of the nine cows, it appeared 
                from the words of the cowherd woman that some were about to calve, 
                others had just calved, others were old, and others again hard-uddered; 
                there was neither butter nor milk enough even for the children. 
                There were no eggs. They could get no fowls; old, purplish, stringy 
                roosters were all they had for roasting and boiling. Impossible 
                to get women to scrub the floors - all were potato hoeing. Driving 
                was out of the question, because one of the horses was restive, 
                and bolted in the shafts. There was no place where they could 
                bathe; the whole of the riverbank was trampled by the cattle and 
                open to the road; even walks were impossible, for the cattle strayed 
                into the garden through a gap in the hedge, and there was one 
                terrible bull, who bellowed, and therefore might be expected to 
                gore somebody. There were no proper cupboards for their clothes; 
                what cupboards there were either would not close at all, or flew 
                open whenever anyone passed by them. There were no pots and kettles; 
                there was no boiler in the washhouse, nor even an ironing board 
                in the maids' room. </p>
              <p> Finding instead of peace and rest all these, from her point 
                of view, fearful calamities, Darya Alexandrovna was at first in 
                despair. She exerted herself to the utmost, felt the hopelessness 
                of the position, and was every instant suppressing the tears that 
                started into her eyes. The bailiff, a retired quartermaster, whom 
                Stepan Arkadyevich had taken a fancy to and had appointed bailiff 
                on account of his handsome and respectful appearance as a hall 
                porter, showed no sympathy for Darya Alexandrovna's woes. He would 
                say respectfully, `Nothing can be done, the peasants are such 
                a wretched lot,' and did nothing to help her. </p>
              <p> The position seemed hopeless. But in the Oblonskys' household, 
                as in all families indeed, there was one inconspicuous but most 
                valuable and useful person - Matriona Philimonovna. She soothed 
                her mistress, assured her that everything would come round (it 
                was her expression, and Matvei had borrowed it from her), and 
                without fuss or hurry proceeded to set to work herself. </p>
              <p> She had immediately made friends with the bailiff's wife, and 
                on the very first day she drank tea with her and the bailiff under 
                the acacias, and reviewed all the circumstances of the position. 
                Very soon Matriona Philimonovna had established her club, so to 
                say, under the acacias, and there it was, in this club, consisting 
                of the bailiff's wife, the village elder, and the countinghouse 
                clerk, that the difficulties of existence were gradually smoothed 
                away, and in a week's time everything actually had come round. 
                The roof was mended, a kitchenmaid was found - a crony of the 
                village elder's - hens were bought, the cows began giving milk, 
                the garden hedge was stopped up with stakes, the carpenter made 
                a mangle, hooks were put in the cupboards, and they ceased to 
                fly open spontaneously and an ironing board covered with army 
                cloth was placed across from the arm of a chair to the chest of 
                drawers, and there was a smell of flatirons in the maids' room. 
              </p>
              <p> `Just see, now, and you were quite in despair,' said Matriona 
                Philimonovna, pointing to the ironing board. </p>
              <p> They even rigged up a bathing shed of straw hurdles. Lily began 
                to bathe, and Darya Alexandrovna began to realize, if only in 
                part, her expectations, if not of a peaceful, at least of a comfortable, 
                life in the country. Peaceful with six children Darya Alexandrovna 
                could not be. One would fall ill, another might easily become 
                so, a third would be without something necessary, a fourth would 
                show symptoms of a bad disposition, and so on. Rare indeed were 
                the brief periods of peace. But these cares and anxieties were 
                for Darya Alexandrovna the sole happiness possible. Had it not 
                been for them, she would have been left alone to brood over her 
                husband who did not love her. And besides, hard though it was 
                for the mother to bear the dread of illness, the illnesses themselves, 
                and the grief of seeing signs of evil propensities in her children 
                - the children themselves were even now repaying her in small 
                joys for her pains. Those joys were so small that they passed 
                unnoticed, like gold in sand, and at bad moments she could see 
                nothing but the pain, nothing but sand; but there were good moments 
                too when she saw nothing but the joy, nothing but gold. </p>
              <p> Now, in the solitude of the country, she began to be more and 
                more frequently aware of those joys. Often, looking at them, she 
                would make every possible effort to persuade herself that she 
                was mistaken, that she as a mother was partial to her children. 
                All the same, she could not help saying to herself that she had 
                charming children, all six of them in different ways, but a set 
                of children such as is not often to be met with - and she was 
                happy in them, and proud of them. </p>

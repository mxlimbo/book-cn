                Dolly came out of her room to the tea of the grownups. Stepan 
                Arkadyevich did not come out. He must have left his wife's room 
                by a back door. </p>
              <p>`I am afraid you'll be cold upstairs,' observed Dolly, addressing 
                Anna; `I want to move you downstairs, and we shall be nearer.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, please, don't trouble about me,' answered Anna, looking 
                intently into Dolly's face, trying to make out whether there had 
                been a reconciliation or not. </p>
              <p> `It will be lighter for you here,' answered her sister-in-law. 
              </p>
              <p> `I assure you that I can sleep like a marmot anywhere and any 
                time.' </p>
              <p> `What's all this?' inquired Stepan Arkadyevich, coming out of 
                his room and addressing his wife. </p>
              <p> From his tone both Kitty and Anna at once gathered that a reconciliation 
                had taken place. </p>
              <p> `I want to move Anna downstairs, but we must hang up blinds. 
                No one knows how to do it; I must see to it myself,' answered 
                Dolly addressing him. </p>
              <p> `God knows whether they are fully reconciled,' thought Anna, 
                hearing her tone, cold and composed. </p>
              <p> `Come, Dolly, why be always making difficulties,' answered her 
                husband. `There, I'll do it all, if you like...' </p>
              <p> `I know how you do everything,' answered Dolly. `You tell Matvei 
                to do what can't be done, and go away yourself, leaving him to 
                make a muddle of everything,' and her habitual, mocking smile 
                curved the corners of Dolly's lips as she spoke. </p>
              <p> `Full, full reconciliation - full,' thought Anna, `thank God!' 
                and rejoicing that she was the cause of it, she went up to Dolly 
                and kissed her. </p>
              <p> `Not at all. Why do you always look down on me and Matvei?' 
                said Stepan Arkadyevich, smiling hardly perceptibly, and addressing 
                his wife. </p>
              <p> The whole evening Dolly was, as always, a little mocking in 
                her tone to her husband, while Stepan Arkadyevich was happy and 
                cheerful, yet not so as to seem as if, having been forgiven, he 
                had forgotten his fault. </p>
              <p> At half-past nine o'clock a particularly joyful and pleasant 
                family conversation over the tea table at the Oblonsky's was broken 
                up by an apparently simple incident. But this simple incident 
                for some reason struck everyone as strange. Having begun talking 
                about common acquaintances in Peterburg, Anna got up quickly. 
              </p>
              <p> `She is in my album,' she said; `and, by the way, I'll show 
                you my Seriozha,' she added, with a mother's smile of pride. </p>
              <p> Toward ten o'clock, when she usually said good night to her 
                son, and often, before going to a ball put him to bed herself, 
                she felt depressed at being so far from him; and whatever she 
                was talking about, she kept coming back in thought to her curly-headed 
                Seriozha. She longed to look at his photograph and talk of him. 
                Seizing the first pretext, she got up, and with her light, resolute 
                step went for her album. The stairs up to her room came out on 
                the landing of the great warm main staircase. </p>
              <p> Just as she was leaving the drawing room, a ring was heard in 
                the hall. </p>
              <p> `Who can that be?' said Dolly. </p>
              <p> `It's too early for me to be fetched, and for anyone else it's 
                too late,' observed Kitty. </p>
              <p> `It's sure to be someone with papers for me,' put in Stepan 
                Arkadyevich. When Anna was passing the top of the staircase, a 
                servant was running up to announce the visitor, while the visitor 
                himself was standing under a lamp. Anna, glancing down, at once 
                recognized Vronsky, and a strange feeling of pleasure and, at 
                the same time, of some dread, stirred in her heart. He stood there, 
                without taking off his coat, and pulling something out of his 
                pocket. At the instant when she was just halfway up the stairs 
                he raised his eyes, caught sight of her, and the expression of 
                his face changed to embarrassment and dismay. With a slight inclination 
                of her head she passed, hearing behind her Stepan Arkadyevich's 
                loud voice calling him to come up, and the quiet, soft, and calm 
                voice of Vronsky refusing. </p>
              <p> When Anna returned with the album he was already gone, and Stepan 
                Arkadyevich was telling them that he had called to inquire about 
                the dinner they were giving next day to a foreign celebrity. </p>
              <p> `And nothing would induce him to come up. What a queer fellow 
                he is!' added Stepan Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> Kitty blushed. She thought that she was the only person who 
                knew why he had come, and why he would not come up. `He has been 
                at home,' she thought, `and didn't find me, and thought I should 
                be here, but he did not come up because he thought it late, and 
                Anna's here.' </p>
              <p> All of them looked at each other, saying nothing, and began 
                to look at Anna's album. </p>
              <p> There was nothing either exceptional or strange in a man's calling 
                at half-past nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed 
                dinner party and not coming in, yet it seemed strange to all of 
                them. And to Anna it seemed stranger and more unpleasant than 
                to any of the others. </p>

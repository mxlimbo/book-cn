                The frightful storm raged and whistled between the wheels of the 
                cars, along the posts, around the corner of the station. The cars, 
                posts, people - everything in sight - were covered with snow on 
                one side, and were getting more and more snowed under. For a moment 
                there would come a lull in the storm, but then it would again 
                swoop down with such gusts that it seemed impossible to withstand 
                it. Meanwhile some men or other were dashing about, gaily talking 
                to one another, making the boards of the platform creak and ceaselessly 
                opening and shutting the big doors. A stooping human shadow glided 
                by at her feet, and she heard a hammer tapping upon iron. `Let's 
                have the telegram!' came an angry voice out of the stormy murk 
                on the other side. `This way! No. 28!' other voices were also 
                shouting, and muffled figures scurried by, plastered with snow. 
                Two gentlemen passed by her, cigarettes glowing in their mouths. 
                She drew in one more deep breath, and had just taken her hand 
                out of her muff to grasp the doorpost and enter the car, when 
                still another man in a military overcoat, quite close beside her, 
                stepped between her and the flickering light of a lantern. She 
                looked round, and the same instant recognized Vronsky's face. 
                Putting his hand to the peak of his cap, he bowed to her and asked 
                if there weren't anything she wanted, whether he could not be 
                of some service to her? She gazed rather long at him, without 
                any answer, and, in spite of the shadow in which he was standing, 
                she saw (or fancied she saw) the expression both of his face and 
                his eyes. It was again that expression of reverent rapture which 
                had affected her so yesterday. More than once she had told herself 
                during the past few days, and only just now, that Vronsky was 
                for her only one of the hundreds of young men, forever exactly 
                the same, that one meets everywhere; that she would never permit 
                herself even to think of him; yet now at the first flush of meeting 
                him, she was seized by an emotion of joyous pride. She had no 
                need to ask why he was here. She knew, as surely as if he had 
                told her, that he was here only to be where she was. </p>
              <p>`I didn't know you were going. And why are you going?' she said, 
                letting fall the hand which had grasped the doorpost. And irrepressible 
                joy and animation shone in her face. </p>
              <p> `Why am I going?' he repeated, looking straight into her eyes. 
                `You know that I am going to be where you are,' he said; `I cannot 
                do otherwise.' </p>
              <p> And at this very point, as though it had overcome all obstacles, 
                the wind scattered the snow from the car roofs, and began to flutter 
                some sheet of iron it had torn off, while the low-pitched whistle 
                of the engine set up a roar in front, dismal and lamenting. All 
                the awesomeness of the blizzard now seemed still more splendid 
                to her. He had uttered precisely what her soul yearned for, but 
                which her reason dreaded. She made no answer, and in her face 
                he beheld a struggle. </p>
              <p> `Forgive me, if what I have said displeases you,' he said humbly. 
              </p>
              <p> He had spoken courteously, deferentially, yet so firmly, so 
                obdurately that, for long, she could find no answer. </p>
              <p> `What you say is wrong, and I beg of you, if you are a good 
                man, to forget what you have said, even as I shall forget it,' 
                she said at last. </p>
              <p> `Not a single word of yours, nor a single gesture, shall I ever 
                forget - nor could I forget....' </p>
              <p> `Enough, enough!' she cried, vainly attempting to give a stern 
                expression to her face, which he was avidly scrutinizing. Clutching 
                at the cold doorpost, she clambered up the steps and quickly entered 
                the corridor of the car. But in this little corridor she paused, 
                reviewing in her imagination all that had occurred. Without recalling 
                her own words or his, she realized instinctively that that conversation 
                had brought them fearfully closer; and she was both frightened 
                and made happy thereby. After standing thus a few seconds, she 
                went into the car and sat down in her place. That tensed state 
                which had tormented her at first was not only renewed, but grew 
                greater and reached such a pitch that she was afraid that, at 
                any moment, something would snap within her from the excessive 
                tension. She did not sleep all night. But in that nervous tension, 
                and in the reveries that filled her imagination, there was nothing 
                unpleasant or gloomy; on the contrary, there was something joyous, 
                glowing and exhilarating. Toward morning Anna dozed off as she 
                sat, and when she awoke it was already light, and the train was 
                nearing Peterburg. At once thoughts of home, of her husband and 
                son, and the details of the day ahead, and days to follow, came 
                thronging upon her. </p>
              <p> At Peterburg, as soon as the train stopped and she got out, 
                the first face that attracted her attention was that of her husband. 
                `Oh, my God! What has happened to his ears?' she thought looking 
                at his frigid and imposing figure, and especially the ears, that 
                struck her so now, as they propped up the brim of his round hat. 
                Catching sight of her he went to meet her, pursing his lips into 
                their habitual mocking smile, and fixing her with his big, tired 
                eyes. Some unpleasant sensation contracted her heart as she met 
                his obdurate and tired glance, as though she had expected to see 
                him a different man. She was particularly struck by that feeling 
                of dissatisfaction with herself which she experienced on meeting 
                him. This was an intimate, familiar feeling, like that state of 
                dissimulation which she experienced in her relations with her 
                husband; but hitherto she had not taken note of the feeling; now 
                she was clearly and painfully aware of it. </p>
              <p> `Yes, as you see, your tender spouse, as devoted as he was during 
                the second year after marriage, was consumed by the desire of 
                seeing you,' he said in his dilatory, high-pitched voice, and 
                in that tone which he almost always used to her - a tone of bantering 
                at anyone who should speak thus in earnest. </p>
              <p> `Is Seriozha quite well?' she asked. </p>
              <p> `And is this all the reward,' said he, `for my ardor? He's well 
                - quite well....' </p>

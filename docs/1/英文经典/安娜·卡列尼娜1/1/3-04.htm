              <p><br>
                The personal matter that absorbed Levin during his conversation 
                with his brother was this. Once, the year previous, he had gone 
                to look at the mowing, and being made very angry by the bailiff 
                he had had recourse to his favorite means for regaining his temper 
                - he had taken a scythe from a peasant and begun mowing. </p>
              <p>He liked the work so much that he had several times tried his 
                hand at mowing since. He had cut the whole of the meadow in front 
                of his house, and this year, ever since the early spring, he had 
                cherished a plan for mowing for whole days together with the peasants. 
                Ever since his brother's arrival he had been in doubt as to whether 
                to mow or not. He was loath to leave his brother alone all day 
                long, and he was afraid his brother would laugh at him about it. 
                But as he drove into the meadow, and recalled the sensations of 
                mowing, he came near deciding that he would go mowing. After the 
                irritating discussion with his brother, he pondered over this 
                intention again. </p>
              <p> `I must have physical exercise, or my temper'll certainly be 
                ruined,' he thought, and he determined he would go mowing, however 
                awkward he might feel about it with his brother or the peasants. 
              </p>
              <p> Toward evening Konstantin Levin went to his countinghouse, gave 
                directions as to the work to be done, and sent about the village 
                to summon the mowers for the morrow, to cut the hay in Kalinov 
                meadow, the largest and best of his grasslands. </p>
              <p> `And send my scythe, please, to Tit, for him to set it, and 
                bring it round tomorrow. I may do some mowing myself, too,' he 
                said, trying not to be embarrassed. </p>
              <p> The bailiff smiled and said: </p>
              <p> `Yes, sir.' </p>
              <p> At tea the same evening Levin said to his brother too. </p>
              <p> `I fancy the fine weather will last,' said he. `Tomorrow I shall 
                start mowing.' </p>
              <p> `I'm so fond of that form of field labor,' said Sergei Ivanovich. 
              </p>
              <p> `I'm awfully fond of it. I sometimes mow myself with the peasants, 
                and tomorrow I want to try mowing the whole day.' </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich lifted his head, and looked with curiosity 
                at his brother. </p>
              <p> `How do you mean? Just like one of the peasants, all day long?' 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, it's very pleasant,' said Levin. </p>
              <p> `It's splendid as exercise, only you'll hardly be able to stand 
                it,' said Sergei Ivanovich, without a shade of irony. </p>
              <p> `I've tried it. It's hard work at first, but you get into it. 
                I dare say I shall manage to keep it up....' </p>
              <p> `Oh, so that's it! But tell me, how do the peasants look at 
                it? I suppose they laugh in their sleeves at their master's being 
                such a queer fish?' </p>
              <p> `No, I don't think so; but it's so delightful, and at the same 
                time such hard work, that one has no time to think about it.' 
              </p>
              <p> `But how will you do about dining with them? To send you a bottle 
                of Lafitte and roast turkey out there would be a little awkward.' 
              </p>
              <p> `No, I'll simply come home at the time of their noonday rest.' 
              </p>
              <p> Next morning Konstantin Levin got up earlier than usual, but 
                he was detained giving directions on the farm, and when he reached 
                the mowing grass the mowers were already at their second swath. 
              </p>
              <p> From the uplands he could get a view of the shaded cut part 
                of the meadow below, with the grayish swaths and the black heaps 
                of coats, taken off by the mowers at the place from which they 
                had started cutting. </p>
              <p> Gradually, as he rode toward the meadow, the peasants came into 
                sight, some in coats, some in their shirts, mowing, one behind 
                another in a long string, each swinging his scythe in his own 
                way. He counted forty-two of them. </p>
              <p> They were mowing slowly over the uneven, low-lying parts of 
                the meadow, where there had been an old dam. Levin recognized 
                some of his own men. Here was old Iermil in a very long white 
                smock, bending forward to swing a scythe; there was a young fellow, 
                Vaska, who had been a coachman of Levin's, taking every swath 
                with a wide sweep. Here, too, was Tit, Levin's preceptor in the 
                art of mowing, a thin little peasant. He went on ahead, and cut 
                his wide swath without bending, as though playing with his scythe. 
              </p>
              <p> Levin got off his mare, and fastening her up by the roadside 
                went to meet Tit, who took a second scythe out of a bush and gave 
                it him. </p>
              <p> `It's ready, sir; it's like a razor - it cuts of itself,' said 
                Tit, taking off his cap with a smile and giving him the scythe. 
              </p>
              <p> Levin took the scythe, and began trying it. As they finished 
                their swaths, the mowers, hot and good-humored, came out into 
                the road one after another, and smirking, greeted the master. 
                They all stared at him, but no one made any remark, till a tall 
                old man, with a wrinkled, beardless face, wearing a short sheepskin 
                jacket, came out into the road and accosted him. </p>
              <p> `Look'ee now, master, once take hold of the rope, there's no 
                letting go!' he said, and Levin heard smothered laughter among 
                the mowers. </p>
              <p> `I'll try not to let it go,' he said, taking his stand behind 
                Tit, and waiting for the time to begin. </p>
              <p> `Mind'ee,' repeated the old man. </p>
              <p> Tit made room, and Levin started behind him. The grass was short 
                close to the road, and Levin, who had not done any mowing for 
                a long while, and was disconcerted by the eyes fastened upon him, 
                cut badly for the first moments, though he swung his scythe vigorously. 
                Behind him he heard voices: </p>
              <p> `It's not set right; handle's too high; see how he has to stoop 
                to it,' said one. </p>
              <p> `Press more on the heel of the scythe,' said another. </p>
              <p> `Never mind, he'll get on all right,' the old man resumed. `See, 
                he's made a start.... You swing it too wide, you'll tire yourself 
                out.... The master, sure, does his best for himself! But see the 
                grass missed out! For such work us fellows would catch it!' </p>
              <p> The grass became lusher, and Levin, listening without answering, 
                followed Tit, trying to do the best he could. They moved a hundred 
                paces. Tit kept moving on, without stopping, nor showing the slightest 
                weariness, but Levin was already beginning to fear he would not 
                be able to keep it up - so tired was he. </p>
              <p> He felt as he swung his scythe that he was at the very end of 
                his strength, and was making up his mind to ask Tit to stop. But 
                at that very moment Tit stopped of his own accord, and, stooping 
                down, picked up some grass, rubbed his scythe, and began whetting 
                it. Levin straightened himself, and drawing a deep breath looked 
                round. Behind him came a peasant, and he too was evidently tired, 
                for he stopped at once without waiting to mow up to Levin, and 
                began whetting his scythe. Tit sharpened his scythe and Levin's, 
                and they went on. </p>
              <p> The next time it was just the same. Tit moved on with sweep 
                after sweep of his scythe, without stopping or showing signs of 
                weariness. Levin followed him, trying not to get left behind, 
                and he found it harder and harder: the moment came when he felt 
                he had no strength left, but at that very moment Tit stopped and 
                whetted the scythes. </p>
              <p> So they mowed the first row. And this long row seemed particularly 
                hard work to Levin; but when the end was reached, and Tit, shouldering 
                his scythe, began with deliberate stride returning on the tracks 
                left by his heels in the cut grass, and Levin walked back in the 
                same way over the space he had cut, in spite of the sweat that 
                ran in streams over his face and fell in drops down his nose, 
                and drenched his back as though he had been soaked in water, he 
                felt very happy. What delighted him particularly was that now 
                he knew he would be able to hold out. </p>
              <p> His pleasure was only disturbed by his swath not being well 
                cut. `I will swing less with my arm and more with my whole body,' 
                he thought, comparing Tit's swath, which looked as if it had been 
                cut along a surveyor's cord, with his own scattered and irregularly 
                lying grass. </p>
              <p> The first swath, as Levin noticed, Tit had mowed especially 
                quickly, probably wishing to put his master to the test, and the 
                swath happened to be a long one. The next swaths were easier, 
                but still Levin had to strain every nerve not to drop behind the 
                peasants. </p>
              <p> He thought of nothing, wished for nothing, save not to be left 
                behind the peasants, and to do his work as well as possible. He 
                heard nothing save the swish of scythes, and saw before him Tit's 
                upright figure mowing away, the crescent-shaped curve of the cut 
                grass, the grass and flowers slowly and rhythmically falling before 
                the blade of his scythe, and ahead of him the end of the swath, 
                where would come the rest. </p>
              <p> Suddenly, in the midst of his toil, without understanding what 
                it was or whence it came, he felt a pleasant sensation of chill 
                on his hot, moist shoulders. He glanced at the sky in the interval 
                for whetting the scythes. A heavy, lowering storm cloud had blown 
                up, and big raindrops were falling. Some of the peasants went 
                to their coats and put them on; others - just like Levin himself 
                - merely shrugged their shoulders, enjoying the pleasant coolness 
                of it. </p>
              <p> Another swath, and yet another swath followed - long swaths 
                and short swaths, with good grass and with poor grass. Levin lost 
                all sense of time, and could not have told whether it were late 
                or early now. A change began to come over his work, which gave 
                him immense satisfaction. In the midst of his toil there were 
                moments during which he forgot what he was doing, and it all came 
                easy to him, and at those same moments his swath was almost as 
                smooth and well cut as Tit's. But as soon as he recollected what 
                he was doing, and began trying to do better, he was at once conscious 
                of all the difficulty of his task, and the swath was badly mown. 
              </p>
              <p> On finishing yet another swath he would have gone back to the 
                top of the meadow again to begin the next, but Tit stopped, and 
                going up to the old man said something in a low voice to him. 
                They both looked at the sun. `What are they talking about, and 
                why doesn't he go back?' thought Levin, without guessing that 
                the peasants had been mowing no less than four hours without stopping, 
                and that it was time for their lunch. </p>
              <p> `Lunch, sir,' said the old man. </p>
              <p> `Is it really time? Lunch it is, then.' </p>
              <p> Levin gave his scythe to Tit, and, together with the peasants, 
                who were crossing the long stretch of mown grass, slightly sprinkled 
                with rain, to get their bread from the heap of coats, he went 
                toward his horse. Only then did he suddenly awake to the fact 
                that he had been wrong about the weather and that the rain was 
                drenching his hay. </p>
              <p> `The hay will be spoiled,' he said. </p>
              <p> `Not a bit of it, sir; mow in the rain, and you'll rake in fine 
                weather!' said the old man. </p>
              <p> Levin untied his horse and rode home to his coffee. </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich was just getting up. When he had drunk his 
                coffee, Levin rode back again to the mowing before Sergei Ivanovich 
                had had time to dress and come down to the dining room. </p>

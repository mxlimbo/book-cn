              <p><br>
                At four o'clock, conscious of his throbbing heart, Levin stepped 
                out of a hired sleigh at the Zoological Gardens and turned along 
                the path to the frozen mounds and the skating ground, knowing 
                that he would certainly find her there, as he had seen the Shcherbatsky's 
                carriage at the entrance. </p>
              <p>It was a bright, frosty day. Rows of carriages, sleighs, drivers 
                and gendarmes were standing in the approach. Crowds of well-dressed 
                people, with hats bright in the sun, swarmed about the entrance 
                and along the well-swept paths between the little houses adorned 
                with carving in the Russian style. The old curly birches of the 
                gardens, all their twigs laden with snow, looked as though freshly 
                decked in sacred vestments. </p>
              <p> He walked along the path toward the skating ground, and kept 
                saying to himself - `You mustn't be excited, you must be calm. 
                What's the matter with you? What do you want? Be still, foolish 
                one,' he conjured his heart. And the more he tried to compose 
                himself, the more breathless he found himself. An acquaintance 
                met him and called him by his name, but Levin did not even recognize 
                him. He went toward the mounds, whence came the clank of the chains 
                of sleighs as they slipped down or were dragged up, the rumble 
                of the sliding sleighs and the sounds of merry voices. He walked 
                on a few steps, and the skating ground lay open before him, and 
                at once, amid all the skaters, he recognized her. </p>
              <p> He knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized 
                his heart. She was standing talking to a lady at the opposite 
                end of the ground. There was apparently nothing striking either 
                in her dress or her attitude, but for Levin she was as easy to 
                find in that crowd as a rose among nettles. Everything was made 
                bright by her. She was the smile that shed light on all around 
                her. `Is it possible I can go over there on the ice - approach 
                her?' he thought. The place where she stood seemed to him a holy 
                shrine, unapproachable, and there was one moment when he was almost 
                retreating, so overwhelmed was he with terror. He had to make 
                an effort to master himself, and to remind himself that people 
                of all sorts were moving about her, and that he, too, might have 
                come there to skate. He descended, for a long while avoiding looking 
                at her as at the sun, yet seeing her, as one does the sun, without 
                looking. </p>
              <p> On that day of the week, and at that time of day, people of 
                one set, all acquainted with one another, used to meet on the 
                ice. There were skillful skaters there, showing off their skill, 
                and beginners clinging to chairs with timid, awkward movements, 
                and boys and elderly people skating with hygienic motives. They 
                seemed to Levin an elect band of blissful beings because they 
                were here, near her. All the skaters, it seemed, with perfect 
                self-possession, skated toward her, skated by her, even spoke 
                to her, and were happy, quite apart from her, enjoying the capital 
                ice and the fine weather. </p>
              <p> Nikolai Shcherbatsky, Kitty's cousin, in a short jacket and 
                tight trousers, was sitting on a bench with his skates on. Seeing 
                Levin, he shouted to him: </p>
              <p> `Ah, the first skater in Russia! Been here long? First-rate 
                ice - do put your skates on.' </p>
              <p> `I haven't got my skates,' Levin answered, marveling at this 
                boldness and ease in her presence, and not for one second losing 
                sight of her, though he did not look at her. He felt as though 
                the sun were coming near him. She was in a corner, and turning 
                out her slender feet in their high boots, she, with obvious timidity, 
                skated toward him. A boy in Russian dress, desperately waving 
                his arms and bending down to the ground, overtook her. She skated 
                a little uncertainly; taking her hands out of the little muff 
                that hung on a cord, she held them ready for emergency, and looking 
                toward Levin, whom she had recognized, she smiled at him and at 
                her own fears. When she had got round the turn, she got a start 
                with one foot and skated straight up to Shcherbatsky. Clutching 
                at his arm, she nodded with a smile to Levin. She was more beautiful 
                than he had imagined her. </p>
              <p> When he thought of her, he could call up a vivid picture of 
                her to himself, especially the charm of that little fair head, 
                so freely set on the shapely girlish shoulders, and so full of 
                childish brightness and kindness. Her childish countenance, together 
                with the delicate beauty of her figure, made up that special charm 
                of hers, which he appreciated so well. But what always struck 
                him in her as something unlooked for was the expression of her 
                eyes - soft, serene and truthful; and, above all, her smile, which 
                always transported Levin to an enchanted world, where he felt 
                moved and tender, as he remembered himself during certain rare 
                days of his early childhood. </p>
              <p> `Have you been here long?' she said, giving him her hand. `Thank 
                you,' she added, as he picked up the handkerchief that had fallen 
                out of her muff. </p>
              <p> `I? Not long ago... yesterday... I mean I arrived... today...' 
                answered Levin, in his emotion not comprehending her question 
                immediately. `I meant to come and see you,' he said; and then, 
                recollecting what his intention was in seeking her, he was promptly 
                overcome with confusion, and blushed. `I didn't know you could 
                skate, and skate so well.' </p>
              <p> She looked at him attentively, as though wishing to make out 
                the cause of his confusion. </p>
              <p> `Your praise is worth having. The tradition is kept up here 
                that you are the best of skaters,' she said, with her little black-gloved 
                hand brushing some needles of hoarfrost off her muff. </p>
              <p> `Yes, I used to skate with passion once upon a time; I wanted 
                to attain perfection.' </p>
              <p> `You do everything with passion, I think,' she said smiling. 
                `I should so like to see how you skate. Do put on skates, and 
                let's skate together.' </p>
              <p> `Skate together Can that be possible?' thought Levin, gazing 
                at her. </p>
              <p> `I'll put them on directly,' he said. </p>
              <p> And he went off to get skates. </p>
              <p> `It's a long while since we've seen you here, sir,' said the 
                attendant, supporting his foot, and screwing on the heel of the 
                skate. `Except you, there's none of the gentlemen first-rate skaters. 
                Will that be all right?' said he, tightening the strap. </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes, yes; make haste, please,' answered Levin, with difficulty 
                restraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his face. 
                `Yes,' he thought, `this is life, this is happiness! Together, 
                she said; let us skate together! Speak to her now? But that's 
                just why I'm afraid to speak - because I'm happy now, happy even 
                though only in hope.... And then?... But I must! I must! I must! 
                Away, faintheartedness!' </p>
              <p> Levin rose to his feet, took off his overcoat, and, gaining 
                speed over the rough ice round the pavilion, came out on the smooth 
                ice and skated without effort, as it were, by, simple exercise 
                of will, increasing and slackening speed and turning his course. 
                He approached her with timidity, but again her smile reassured 
                him. </p>
              <p> She gave him her hand, and they set off side by side, going 
                faster and faster, and the more rapidly they moved the more tightly 
                she grasped his hand. </p>
              <p> `With you I should soon learn; I somehow feel confidence in 
                you,' she said to him. </p>
              <p> `And I have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me,' 
                he said, but was at once frightened at what he had said, and blushed. 
                And indeed, no sooner had he uttered these words, than all at 
                once, like the sun going behind a cloud, her face lost all its 
                tenderness, and Levin detected the familiar change in her expression 
                that denoted mental concentration; a tiny wrinkle came upon her 
                smooth brow. </p>
              <p> `Is there anything troubling you? However, I've no right to 
                ask such a question,' he said hurriedly. </p>
              <p> `Oh, why so?... No, I have nothing to trouble me,' she responded 
                coldly, and immediately added: `You haven't seen Mlle. Linon, 
                have you?' </p>
              <p> `Not yet.' </p>
              <p> `Go and speak to her - she likes you so much.' </p>
              <p> `What's wrong? I have offended her. Lord help me!' thought Levin, 
                and he flew towards the old Frenchwoman with the gray ringlets, 
                who was sitting on a bench. Smiling and showing her false teeth, 
                she greeted him as an old friend. </p>
              <p> `Yes, you see we're growing up,' she said to him, glancing toward 
                Kitty, `and growing old. Tiny bear has grown big now!' pursued 
                the Frenchwoman, laughing, and she reminded him of his joke about 
                the three young ladies whom he had compared to the three bears 
                in the English nursery tale. `Do you remember that's what you 
                used to call them?' </p>
              <p> He remembered absolutely nothing, but she had been laughing 
                at the joke for ten years now and was fond of it. </p>
              <p> `Now, go and skate, go and skate. Our Kitty has learned to skate 
                nicely, hasn't she?' </p>
              <p> When Levin darted up to Kitty her face was no longer stern; 
                her eyes looked at him with the same sincerity and tenderness, 
                but Levin fancied that in her tenderness there was a certain note 
                of deliberate composure. And he felt depressed. After talking 
                a little of her old governess and her peculiarities, she questioned 
                him about his life. </p>
              <p> `Surely, you must feel dull in the country in the winter,' she 
                said. </p>
              <p> `No, I'm not dull - I am very busy,' he said, feeling that she 
                was making him submit to her composed tone, which he would not 
                have the strength to break through - just as had been the case 
                at the beginning of the winter. </p>
              <p> `Are you going to stay in town long?' Kitty questioned him. 
              </p>
              <p> `I don't know,' he answered, not thinking of what he was saying. 
                The thought came into his mind that if he were held in submission 
                by her tone of quiet friendliness he would end by going back again 
                without deciding anything, and he resolved to mutiny against it. 
              </p>
              <p> `How is it you don't know?' </p>
              <p> `I don't know. It depends upon you,' he said, and was immediately 
                horror-stricken at his own words. </p>
              <p> Whether it was that she did not hear his words, or that she 
                did not want to hear them, she made a sort of stumble, twice struck 
                out, and hurriedly skated away from him. She skated up to Mlle. 
                Linon, said something to her, and went toward the pavilion where 
                the ladies took off their skates. </p>
              <p> `My God! What have I done! Merciful God! Help me, guide me,' 
                said Levin, praying inwardly, and at the same time, feeling a 
                need of violent exercise, he skated about, describing concentric 
                and eccentric circles. </p>
              <p> At that moment one of the young men, the best of the skaters 
                of the day, came out of the coffeehouse on his skates, with a 
                cigarette in his mouth. Taking a run he dashed down the steps 
                on his skates, crashing and leaping. He flew down, and without 
                even changing the free-and-easy position of his hands, skated 
                away over the ice. </p>
              <p> `Ah, that's a new trick!' said Levin, and he promptly ran up 
                to the top to perform this new trick. </p>
              <p> `Don't break your neck! This needs practice!' Nikolai Shcherbatsky 
                shouted after him. </p>
              <p> Levin went to the steps, took a run from above as best he could, 
                and dashed down, preserving his balance in this unwonted movement 
                with his hands. On the last step he stumbled, but barely touching 
                the ice with his hand, with a violent effort recovered himself, 
                and skated off, laughing. </p>
              <p> `What a fine, darling chap he is!' Kitty was thinking at that 
                moment, as she came out of the pavilion with Mlle. Linon and looked 
                toward him with a smile of quiet kindness, as though he were a 
                favorite brother. `And can it be my fault, can I have done anything 
                wrong? They talk of coquetry. I know it's not he that I love; 
                but still I am happy with him, and he's so nice. Only, why did 
                he say that?...' she mused. </p>
              <p> Catching sight of Kitty going away, and her mother meeting her 
                at the steps, Levin, flushed from his rapid exercise, stood still 
                and pondered a minute. He took off his skates, and overtook the 
                mother and daughter at the entrance of the gardens. </p>
              <p> `Delighted to see you,' said Princess Shcherbatskaia. `On Thursdays 
                we are home, as always.' </p>
              <p> `Today, then?' </p>
              <p> `We shall be pleased to see you,' the Princess said stiffly. 
              </p>
              <p> This stiffness hurt Kitty, and she could not resist the desire 
                to smooth over her mother's coldness. She turned her head, and 
                with a smile said: </p>
              <p> `Good-by till this evening.' </p>
              <p> At that moment Stepan Arkadyevich, his hat cocked on one side, 
                with beaming face and eyes, strode into the garden like a buoyant 
                conqueror. But as he approached his mother-in-law, he responded 
                to her inquiries about Dolly's health with a mournful and guilty 
                countenance. After a little subdued and dejected conversation 
                with her he set straight his chest again, and took Levin by the 
                arm. </p>
              <p> `Well, shall we set off?' he asked. `I've been thinking about 
                you all this time, and I'm very, very glad you've come,' he said, 
                looking him in the face with a significant air. </p>
              <p> `Yes, come along,' answered Levin in ecstasy, hearing unceasingly 
                the sound of that voice saying, `Good-by till this evening,' and 
                seeing the smile with which it was said. </p>
              <p> `To England or The Hermitage?' </p>
              <p> `It's all the same to me.' </p>
              <p> `Well, then, England it is,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, selecting 
                that restaurant because he owed more there than at The Hermitage, 
                and consequently considered it mean to avoid it. `Have you got 
                a sleigh? That's fine - for I sent my carriage home.' </p>
              <p> The friends hardly spoke all the way. Levin was wondering what 
                that change in Kitty's expression had meant, and alternately assuring 
                himself that there was hope, and falling into despair, seeing 
                clearly that his hopes were insane, and yet all the while he felt 
                himself quite another man, utterly unlike what he had been before 
                her smile and those words, `Good-by till this evening.' </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich was absorbed during the drive in composing 
                the menu of the dinner. </p>
              <p> `You like turbot, don't you?' he said to Levin as they were 
                arriving. </p>
              <p> `Eh?' responded Levin. `Turbot? Yes, I'm awfully fond of turbot.'

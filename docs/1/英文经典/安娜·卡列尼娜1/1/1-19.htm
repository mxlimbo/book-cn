              <p><br>
                When Anna entered the tiny drawing room, she found Dolly sitting 
                there with a white-headed plump little boy, already resembling 
                his father; she was listening to a lesson in French reading. As 
                the boy read, he kept twisting and trying to tear off a button 
                that was nearly off his jacket. His mother had several times taken 
                his hand from it, but the plump little hand went back to the button 
                again. His mother pulled the button off and put it in her pocket. 
                <br>
                `Keep your hands still, Grisha,' she said, and she took up her 
                work, a coverlet she had long been making. She always set to work 
                on it at depressed moments, and now she knitted at it nervously, 
                twitching her fingers and counting the stitches. Though she had 
                sent word the day before to her husband that it was nothing to 
                her whether his sister came or not, she had made everything ready 
                for her arrival, and was expecting her sister-in-law with agitation. 
              </p>
              <p> Dolly was crushed by her sorrow, utterly swallowed up by it. 
                Still she did not forget that Anna, her sister-in-law, was the 
                wife of one of the most important personages in Peterburg, and 
                was a Peterburg grande dame. And, thanks to this circumstance, 
                she did not carry out her threat to her husband - that is to say, 
                she had not forgotten that her sister-in-law was coming. `And, 
                after all, Anna is in no wise to blame,' thought Dolly. `I know 
                nothing save the very best about her, and I have seen nothing 
                but kindness and affection from her toward myself.' It was true 
                that as far as she could recall her impressions at Peterburg at 
                the Karenin's, she did not like their household itself; there 
                was something artificial about the whole arrangement of their 
                family life. `But why should I not receive her? If only she doesn't 
                take it into her head to console me!' thought Dolly. `All consolations 
                and exhortations and Christian forgiveness - I have thought all 
                this over a thousand times, and it's all no use.' </p>
              <p> All these days Dolly had been alone with her children. She did 
                not want to talk of her sorrow, but with that sorrow in her heart 
                she could not talk of outside matters. </p>
              <p> She knew that in one way or another she would tell Anna everything, 
                and she was alternately glad at the thought of speaking freely, 
                and angry at the necessity of speaking of her humiliation with 
                her, his sister, and of hearing her ready-made phrases of exhortation 
                and consolation. </p>
              <p> She had been on the lookout for her, glancing at her watch every 
                minute, and, as often happens, let slip that precise minute when 
                her visitor arrived, so that she did not hear the bell. </p>
              <p> Catching the sound of skirts and of light steps at the door, 
                she looked round, and her careworn face unconsciously expressed 
                not gladness, but wonder. She got up and embraced her sister-in-law. 
              </p>
              <p> `What, here already?' she said as she kissed her. </p>
              <p> `Dolly, how glad I am to see you!' </p>
              <p> `I am glad, too,' said Dolly, faintly smiling, and trying by 
                the expression of Anna's face to find out whether she knew. `Most 
                likely she knows,' she thought, noticing the sympathy in Anna's 
                face. `Well, come along, I'll take you to your room,' she went 
                on, trying to defer as long as possible the time of explanation. 
              </p>
              <p> `Is this Grisha? Heavens, how he's grown!' said Anna; and kissing 
                him, never taking her eyes off Dolly, she stood still and flushed. 
                `No, please, let us stay here.' </p>
              <p> She took off her shawl and her hat, and catching it in a lock 
                of her black hair, which was a mass of curls, she tossed her head 
                and shook her hair down. </p>
              <p> `You are radiant with health and happiness!' said Dolly, almost 
                with envy. </p>
              <p> `I?... Yes,' said Anna. `Merciful heavens, Tania! You're the 
                same age as my Seriozha,' she added, addressing the little girl 
                as she ran in. She took her in her arms and kissed her. `Delightful 
                child, delightful! Show me them all.' </p>
              <p> She mentioned them, not only remembering the names, but the 
                years, months, characters, illnesses of all the children, and 
                Dolly could not but appreciate that. </p>
              <p> `Very well, we will go to them,' she said. `It's a pity Vassia's 
                asleep.' </p>
              <p> After seeing the children, they sat down, alone now, in the 
                drawing room, to coffee. Anna took the tray, and then pushed it 
                away from her. </p>
              <p> `Dolly,' she said, `he has told me.' </p>
              <p> Dolly looked coldly at Anna; she was waiting now for hypocritically 
                sympathetic phrases, but Anna said nothing of the sort. </p>
              <p> `Dolly, darling,' she said, `I don't want to intercede for him, 
                nor to try to comfort you - that's impossible. But, my dearest, 
                I'm simply sorry, sorry from my heart for you!' </p>
              <p> Under the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered. 
                She moved nearer to her sister-in-law and took her hand in her 
                own, vigorous and little. Dolly did not shrink away, but her face 
                did not lose its frigid expression. She said: </p>
              <p> `To comfort me is impossible. Everything's lost after what has 
                happened, everything's over!' </p>
              <p> And directly she had said this, her face suddenly softened. 
                Anna lifted the wasted, thin hand of Dolly, kissed it and said: 
              </p>
              <p> `But, Dolly, what's to be done, what's to be done? How is it 
                best to act in this awful position - that's what you must think 
                of.' </p>
              <p> `All's over, and there's nothing more,' said Dolly. `And the 
                worst of it all is, you see, that I can't cast him off: there 
                are the children - my hands are tied. And I can't live with him! 
                It's a torture for me to see him.' </p>
              <p> `Dolly, darling, he has spoken to me, but I want to hear it 
                from you: tell me all about it.' </p>
              <p> Dolly looked at her inquiringly. </p>
              <p> Sympathy and love unfeigned were apparent on Anna's face. </p>
              <p> `Very well,' she suddenly said. `But I will begin at the beginning. 
                You know how I was married. With the education maman gave us I 
                was more than innocent - I was foolish. I knew nothing. They say, 
                I know, men tell their wives of their former lives, but Stiva' 
                - she corrected herself - `Stepan Arkadyevich told me nothing. 
                You'll hardly believe it, but till now I imagined that I was the 
                only woman he had known. So I lived eight years. You must understand 
                that I was not only far from suspecting infidelity, but I regarded 
                it as impossible, and then - try to imagine it - with such conceptions 
                to find out suddenly all the horror, all the loathsomeness... 
                You must try and understand me. To be fully convinced of one's 
                happiness, and all at once...' continued Dolly, holding back her 
                sobs, `To get a letter... His letter to his mistress, a governess 
                in my employ. No, it's too awful!' She hastily pulled out her 
                handkerchief and hid her face in it. `I can understand if it were 
                passion,' she went on, after a brief silence, `but to deceive 
                me deliberately, slyly... And with whom?... To go on being my 
                husband while he and she... It's awful! You can't understand...' 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes, I understand! I understand! Dolly, dearest, I do understand,' 
                said Anna, pressing her hand. </p>
              <p> `And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position? 
                Dolly resumed. `Not in the slightest! He's happy and contented.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, no!' Anna interposed quickly. `He's to be pitied, he's 
                weighed down by remorse...' </p>
              <p> `Is he capable of remorse?' Dolly interrupted, gazing intently 
                into her sister-in-law's face. </p>
              <p> `Yes. I know him. I could not look at him without feeling sorry 
                for him. We both know him. He's good-natured, but he's proud, 
                and now he's so humiliated. What touched me most...' (And here 
                Anna guessed what would touch Dolly most.) `He's tortured by two 
                things: that he's ashamed for the children's sake, and that, loving 
                you - yes, yes, loving you beyond everything on earth,' she hurriedly 
                interrupted Dolly, who would have rejoined - `he has hurt you, 
                pierced you to the heart. ``No, no, she cannot forgive me,'' he 
                keeps on saying.' </p>
              <p> Dolly looked pensively past her sister-in-law as she listened 
                to her words. </p>
              <p> `Yes, I can see that his position is awful; it's worse for the 
                guilty than the innocent,' she said, `if he feels that all the 
                misery comes from his fault. But how am I to forgive him, how 
                am I to be his wife again after her? For me to live with him now 
                would be torture, just because I love my past love for him...' 
              </p>
              <p> And sobs cut short her words. </p>
              <p> But as though of set design, each time she was softened she 
                began to speak again of what exasperated her. </p>
              <p> `She's young, you see, she's pretty,' she went on. `Do you know, 
                Anna, my youth and my beauty are gone, taken by whom? By him and 
                his children. I have worked for him, and all I had has gone in 
                his service, and now of course any fresh, vulgar creature has 
                more charm for him. No doubt they talked of me together, or, worse 
                still, they were silent about me.... Do you understand?' </p>
              <p> Again her eyes glowed with hatred. </p>
              <p> `And after that he will tell me... What! Am I to believe him? 
                Never! No, everything is over, everything that once constituted 
                my comfort, the reward of my work and of my sufferings... Would 
                you believe it? I was teaching Grisha just now: once this was 
                a joy to me, now it is a torture. What have I to strive and toil 
                for? Why to have children? What's so awful is that all at once 
                my heart's turned, and instead of love and tenderness, I have 
                nothing but hatred for him; yes, hatred. I could kill him and...' 
              </p>
              <p> `Darling Dolly, I understand, but don't torture yourself You 
                are so insulted, so excited, that you look at many things mistakenly.' 
              </p>
              <p> Dolly grew calmer, and for two minutes both were silent. </p>
              <p> `What's to be done? Think for me, Anna, help me. I have thought 
                over everything, and I see nothing.' </p>
              <p> Anna could not find anything, but her heart echoed instantly 
                to each word, to each change of expression on her sister-in-law's 
                face. </p>
              <p> `One thing I would say,' began Anna. `I am his sister, I know 
                his character, that faculty of forgetting everything, everything' 
                (she waved her hand before her forehead), `that faculty for being 
                completely carried away, but for completely repenting, too. He 
                cannot believe it, he cannot comprehend now, how he could have 
                acted as he did.' </p>
              <p> `No; he understands, and understood!' Dolly broke in. `But I... 
                You are forgetting me... Does that make it easier for me?' </p>
              <p> `Wait a minute. When he told me, I will own I did not realize 
                all the horror of your position. I saw nothing but him, and that 
                the family was broken up. I felt sorry for him, but after talking 
                to you, I see it, as a woman, quite differently. I see your agony, 
                and I can't tell you how sorry I am for you! But, Dolly, darling, 
                while I fully realize your sufferings, there is one thing I don't 
                know; I don't know... I don't know how much love there is still 
                in your heart for him. That you know - whether there is enough 
                for you to be able to forgive him. If there is - forgive him!' 
              </p>
              <p> `No,' Dolly was beginning, but Anna cut her short, kissing her 
                hand once more. </p>
              <p> `I know more of the world than you do,' she said. I know how 
                men like Stiva look at it. You speak of his talking of you with 
                her. That never happened. Such men are unfaithful, but their own 
                home and wife are sacred to them. Somehow or other these women 
                are still looked on with contempt by them, and do not touch on 
                their feeling for their family. They draw a sort of line that 
                can't be crossed between them and their families. I don't understand 
                it, but it is so.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, but he has kissed her...' </p>
              <p> `Dolly, hush, darling. I saw Stiva when he was in love with 
                you. I remember the time when he came to me and cried, talking 
                of you, and of what a poetry and loftiness you were for him, and 
                I know that the longer he has lived with you the loftier you have 
                been in his eyes. You know we have sometimes laughed at him for 
                putting in at every word: `Dolly's a marvelous woman.' have always 
                been a divinity for him, and you are that still, and this has 
                not been a passion of the heart... </p>
              <p> `But if it be repeated?' </p>
              <p> `It cannot be, as I understand it... </p>
              <p> `Yes, but could you forgive it?' </p>
              <p> `I don't know, I can't judge... No, I can judge,' said Anna, 
                thinking a moment; and grasping the position in her thought and 
                weighing it in her inner balance, she added: `Yes, I can, I can, 
                I can. Yes, I could forgive. I could not be the same, no; but 
                I could forgive, and forgive as though it had never been, never 
                been at all....' </p>
              <p> `Oh, of course,' Dolly interposed quickly, as though saying 
                what she had more than once thought, `else it would not be forgiveness. 
                If one forgives, it must be completely, completely. Come, let 
                us go; I'll take you to your room,' she said, getting up, and

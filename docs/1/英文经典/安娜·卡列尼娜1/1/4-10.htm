                Pestsov liked threshing an argument out to the end, and was not 
                satisfied with Sergei Ivanovich's words, especially as he felt 
                the injustice of his view. <br>
                `I did not mean,' he said over the soup, addressing Alexei Alexandrovich, 
                `mere density of population alone, but in conjunction with fundamental 
                ideas, and not by means of principles.' </p>
              <p> `It seems to me,' Alexei Alexandrovich said languidly, and with 
                no haste, `that that's the same thing. In my opinion, influence 
                over another people is only possible to the people which has the 
                higher development, which...' </p>
              <p> `But that's just the question,' Pestsov broke in in his bass. 
                He was always in a hurry to speak, and seemed always to put his 
                whole soul into whatever he was saying; `of what are we to make 
                higher development consist? The English, the French, the Germans 
                - which is at the highest stage of development? Which of them 
                will nationalize the other? We see the Rhine provinces have been 
                turned French, yet the Germans are not at a lower stage!' he shouted. 
                `There is another law at work there!' </p>
              <p> `I fancy that the greater influence is always on the side of 
                true civilization,' said Alexei Alexandrovich, slightly lifting 
                his eyebrows. </p>
              <p> `But what are we to lay down as the outward signs of true civilization?' 
                said Pestsov. </p>
              <p> `I imagine such signs are generally very well known,' said Alexei 
                Alexandrovich. </p>
              <p> `But are they fully known?' Sergei Ivanovich put in with a subtle 
                smile. `It is the accepted view now that real culture must be 
                purely classical; but we see most intense disputes on each side 
                of the question, and there is no denying that the opposite camp 
                has strong points in its favor.' </p>
              <p> `You are for the classics, Sergei Ivanovich. Will you take red 
                wine?' said Stepan Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> `I am not expressing my own opinion of either form of culture,' 
                Sergei Ivanovich said, holding out his glass with a smile of condescension, 
                as to a child. `I only say that both sides have strong arguments 
                to support them,' he went on, addressing Alexei Alexandrovich. 
                `My sympathies are classical from education, but in this discussion 
                I am personally unable to arrive at a conclusion. I see no distinct 
                grounds for classical studies being given a pre-eminence over 
                scientific studies.' </p>
              <p> `The natural sciences have just as great an educational value,' 
                put in Pestsov. `Take astronomy, take botany, or zoology, with 
                its system of general principles.' </p>
              <p> `I cannot quite agree with that,' responded Alexei Alexandrovich. 
                `It seems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying 
                the forms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on 
                intellectual development. Moreover, it cannot be denied that the 
                influence of the classical authors is in the highest degree moral, 
                while, unfortunately, with the study of the natural sciences are 
                associated the false and noxious doctrines which are the curse 
                of our day.' </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich would have said something, but Pestsov interrupted 
                him in his rich bass. He began warmly contesting the justice of 
                this view. Sergei Ivanovich waited serenely to speak, obviously 
                with a convincing reply ready. </p>
              <p> `But,' said Sergei Ivanovich, smiling subtly, and addressing 
                Karenin, `one must allow that to weigh all the advantages and 
                disadvantages of classical and scientific studies is a difficult 
                task, and the question which form of education was to be preferred 
                would not have been so quickly and conclusively decided if there 
                had not been in favor of classical education, as you expressed 
                it just now, its moral - disons le mot - antinihilist influence.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Undoubtedly.' </p>
              <p> `If it had not been for the distinctive property of antinihilistic 
                influence on the side of classical studies, we should have considered 
                the subject more, have weighed the arguments on both sides,' said 
                Sergei Ivanovich with a subtle smile, `we should have given elbowroom 
                to both tendencies. But now we know that these little pills of 
                classical learning possess the medicinal property of antinihilism, 
                and we boldly prescribe them to our patients.... But what if they 
                had no such medicinal property?' he added his pinch of Attic salt. 
              </p>
              <p> At Sergei Ivanovich's little pills everyone laughed; Turovtsin 
                in especial roared loudly and jovially, glad at last to have found 
                something to laugh at - all he ever looked for in listening to 
                conversation. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich had not made a mistake in inviting Pestsov. 
                With Pestsov intellectual conversation never flagged for an instant. 
                Directly Sergei Ivanovich had concluded the conversation with 
                his jest, Pestsov promptly started a new one. </p>
              <p> `I can't agree even,' said he, `that the government had that 
                aim. The government obviously is guided by abstract considerations, 
                and remains indifferent to the influence its measures may exercise. 
                The education of women, for instance, would naturally be regarded 
                as likely to be harmful, but the government opens schools and 
                universities for women.' </p>
              <p> And the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the 
                education of women. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich expressed the idea that the education of 
                women is apt to be confounded with the emancipation of women, 
                and that it is only so that it can be considered dangerous. </p>
              <p> `I consider, on the contrary, that the two questions are inseparably 
                connected together,' said Pestsov; `it is a vicious circle. Woman 
                is deprived of rights from lack of education, and the lack of 
                education results from the absence of rights. We must not forget 
                that the subjection of women is so complete, and dates from such 
                distant ages, that we are often unwilling to recognize the gulf 
                that separates them from us,' said he. </p>
              <p> `You mentioned rights,' said Sergei Ivanovich, waiting till 
                Pestsov had finished, `meaning the right of sitting on juries, 
                of voting, of presiding at councils, the right of entering the 
                civil service, of sitting in parliament....' </p>
              <p> `Undoubtedly.' </p>
              <p> `But if women, as a rare exception, can occupy such positions, 
                it seems to me you are wrong in using the expression ``rights'. 
                It would be more correct to say duties. Every man will agree that 
                in doing the duty of a juryman, a witness, a telegraph clerk, 
                we feel we are performing duties. And, therefore, it would be 
                correct to say that women are seeking duties, and quite legitimately. 
                And one can but sympathize with this desire to assist in the general 
                labor of man.' </p>
              <p> `Quite so,' Alexei Alexandrovich assented. `The question, I 
                imagine, is simply whether they are fitted for such duties.' </p>
              <p> `They will most likely be perfectly fitted,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                `when education has become general among them. We see this...' 
              </p>
              <p> `How about the proverb?' said the Prince, who had a long while 
                been intent on the conversation, his mocking little eyes twinkling. 
                `I can say it before my daughters: her hair is long, but her wit 
                is short....' </p>
              <p> `Just what they thought of the Negroes before their emancipation!' 
                said Pestsov angrily. </p>
              <p> `What seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh duties,' 
                said Sergei Ivanovich, `while we see, unhappily, that men usually 
                try to avoid them.' </p>
              <p> `Duties are bound up with rights - power, money, honor; those 
                are what women are seeking,' said Pestsov. </p>
              <p> `Just as though I should seek the right to be a wet nurse, and 
                feel injured because women are paid for the work, while no one 
                will take me,' said the old Prince. </p>
              <p> Turovtsin exploded in a loud roar of laughter, and Sergei Ivanovich 
                regretted that he had not made this comparison. Even Alexei Alexandrovich 
                smiled. </p>
              <p> `Yes, but a man can't nurse a baby,' said Pestsov, `while a 
                woman...' </p>
              <p> `No, there was an Englishman who did suckle his baby on board 
                ship,' said the old Prince, feeling this freedom in conversation 
                permissible before his own daughters. </p>
              <p> `There are as many such Englishmen as there would be women officials,' 
                said Sergei Ivanovich. </p>
              <p> `Yes, but what is a girl to do who has no family?' put in Stepan 
                Arkadyevich, thinking of Masha Chibisova, whom he had had in his 
                mind all along, in sympathizing with Pestsov and supporting him. 
              </p>
              <p> `If the story of such a girl were thoroughly sifted, you would 
                find she had abandoned a family - her own or a sister's, where 
                she might have found a woman's duties,' Darya Alexandrovna broke 
                in unexpectedly, in a tone of exasperation, probably suspecting 
                what sort of girl Stepan Arkadyevich had in mind. </p>
              <p> `But we take our stand on principle, on the ideal,' replied 
                Pestsov in his sonorous bass. `Woman desires to have the right 
                to be independent, educated. She is oppressed, humiliated by the 
                consciousness of her disabilities.' </p>
              <p> `And I'm oppressed and humiliated that they won't engage me 
                at the Foundling Asylum,' the old Prince said again, to the huge 
                delight of Turovtsin, who in his mirth dropped his asparagus with 
                the thick end in the sauce. </p>

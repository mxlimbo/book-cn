              <p><br>
                The first person to meet Anna at home was her son. He dashed down 
                the stairs to her, in spite of the governes'ss call, and with 
                frenzied rapture shrieked: `Mother! mother!' Running up to her, 
                he hung on her neck. <br>
                `I told you it was mother!' he shouted to the governess. `I knew 
                it!' </p>
              <p> And her son, like her husband, aroused in Anna a feeling akin 
                to disappointment. In her imagination he had been better than 
                he was in reality. She had to descend to reality to enjoy him 
                as he was. But, even so, he was charming, with his fair curls, 
                his blue eyes and his chubby, graceful little legs in tightly 
                pulled-up stockings. Anna experienced an almost physical delight 
                in the sensation of his nearness, and his caresses; and a moral 
                reassurance, when she met his ingenuous, trusting and loving glance, 
                and heard his naive questions. Anna took out the presents Dolly's 
                children had sent him, and told her son about Tania, a little 
                girl in Moscow, and how Tania could read, and even taught the 
                other children. </p>
              <p> `Why, am I not as good as she?' asked Seriozha. </p>
              <p> `To me you're better than anyone else in the whole world.' </p>
              <p> `I know that,' said Seriozha, smiling. </p>
              <p> Anna had scarcely drunk her coffee when the Countess Lidia Ivanovna 
                was announced. The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a tall, fleshy 
                woman, with an unwholesomely yellow complexion and beautiful, 
                pensive black eyes. Anna liked her, but today she seemed, for 
                the first time, to see her with all her shortcomings. </p>
              <p> `Well, my friend, were you the bearer of the olive branch?' 
                asked Countess Lidia Ivanovna, the minute she entered the room. 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, it's all over, but it was not at all as serious as we 
                thought,' answered Anna. `My belle-soeur is, in general, much 
                too categorical.' </p>
              <p> But Countess Lidia Ivanovna, who was interested in everything 
                that did not concern her, had a habit of never listening to what 
                interested her; she interrupted Anna: </p>
              <p> `Yes, there's plenty of sorrow and evil in the world - and I 
                am so fatigued today!' </p>
              <p> `Oh, why?' asked Anna, trying to repress a smile. </p>
              <p> `I'm beginning to weary of vainly breaking lances for the truth, 
                and at times I'm altogether unstrung. The affair with our Dear 
                Sisters [this was a religiously patriotic, philanthropic institution] 
                started off splendidly, but it's impossible to do anything with 
                such people,' added Countess Lidia Ivanovna, with a mocking submissiveness 
                to fate. `They pounced on the idea, and mangled it, and afterward 
                they thrash it out so pettily and trivially. Two or three people, 
                your husband among them, grasp all the significance of this affair 
                but the others merely degrade it. Yesterday Pravdin wrote to me...' 
              </p>
              <p> Pravdin was a well-known Pan-Slavist abroad, and Countess Lidia 
                Ivanovna told the gist of his letter. </p>
              <p> Next the Countess spoke of other unpleasantnesses and intrigues 
                against the work of the unification of the churches, and departed 
                in haste, since that day she had to attend the meeting of another 
                society, and also a Slavonic committee. </p>
              <p> `All this is as it has always been; but how is it I didn't notice 
                it before?' Anna asked herself. `Or has she been very much irritated 
                today? It's really ludicrous: her object is to do good; she's 
                a Christian; yet she's forever angry, and forever having enemies 
                - and always enemies in the name of Christianity and doing good.' 
              </p>
              <p> After Countess Lidia Ivanovna another friend came, the wife 
                of a director of the Department, who told her all the news of 
                the town. At three o'clock she too went away, promising to come 
                to dinner. Alexei Alexandrovich was at the Ministry. Anna, left 
                alone, spent the time till dinner in lending her presence to her 
                son's dinner (he dined apart from his parents), in putting her 
                things in order, and in reading and answering the notes and letters 
                which had accumulated on her escritoire. </p>
              <p> The feeling of unreasoning shame, which she had felt during 
                the journey, and her agitation, had completely vanished. In the 
                accustomed conditions of her life she again felt herself firm 
                and irreproachable. </p>
              <p> She recalled with wonder her state of mind only yesterday. `What 
                was it? Nothing. Vronsky said something silly, which it was easy 
                to put an end to, and I answered just as I should have. To speak 
                of it to my husband would be unnecessary and impermissible. To 
                speak of it would be to attach importance to that which has none.' 
                She remembered how she had told her husband of what was almost 
                declaration made her in Peterburg by a young man, a subordinate 
                of her husband's, and how Alexei Alexandrovich had answered that 
                every woman of the world was exposed to this sort of thing, but 
                that he had the fullest confidence in her tact, and would never 
                permit himself to degrade her and himself by jealousy. `So then, 
                there's no reason to say anything? And, thank God, there isn't 
                anything to say,' she told herself. </p>

              <p><br>
                Running halfway down the staircase, Levin caught a sound he knew, 
                a familiar cough in the hall. But he heard it indistinctly through 
                the sound of his own footsteps, and hoped he was mistaken. Then 
                he caught sight of a long, bony, familiar figure, and now it seemed 
                there was no possibility of mistake; and yet he still went on 
                hoping that this tall man taking off his fur cloak and coughing 
                was not his brother Nikolai. </p>
              <p>Levin loved his brother, but being with him was always a torture. 
                Just now, when Levin, under the influence of the thoughts that 
                had come to him, and Agathya Mikhailovna's hint, was in a troubled 
                and uncertain humor, this meeting with his brother which he had 
                to face seemed particularly difficult. Instead of a lively, healthy 
                visitor, some outsider who would, he hoped, cheer him up in his 
                uncertain humor, he had to see his brother, who knew him through 
                and through, who would call forth all the thoughts nearest his 
                heart, would force him to show himself fully. And that he was 
                not disposed to do. </p>
              <p> Angry with himself for so base a feeling, Levin ran into the 
                hall; as soon as he had seen his brother close, this feeling of 
                selfish disappointment vanished instantly and was replaced by 
                pity. Terrible as his brother Nikolai had been before in his emaciation 
                and sickliness, now he looked still more emaciated, still more 
                wasted. He was a skeleton covered by skin. </p>
              <p> He stood in the hall, jerking his long thin neck, and pulling 
                the scarf off it, and smiled a strange and pitiful smile. When 
                he saw that smile, submissive and humble, Levin felt something 
                clutching at his throat. </p>
              <p> `You see, I've come to you,' said Nikolai in a thick voice, 
                never for one second taking his eyes off his brother's face. `I've 
                been meaning to a long while, but I've been constantly unwell. 
                Now I'm ever so much better,' he said, rubbing his beard with 
                his big thin hands. </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes!' answered Levin. And he felt still more frightened 
                when, kissing him, he felt with his lips the dryness of his brother's 
                skin and saw close to him his big eyes, full of a strange light. 
              </p>
              <p> A few weeks before, Konstantin Levin had written to his brother 
                that through the sale of the small part of the property that had 
                remained undivided, there was a sum of about two thousand roubles 
                to come to him as his share. </p>
              <p> Nikolai said that he had come now to take his money and, what 
                was more important, to stay a while in the old nest, to get in 
                touch with the earth, so as to renew his strength like the heroes 
                of old for the work that lay before him. In spite of his exaggerated 
                stoop, and the emaciation that was so striking from his height, 
                his movements were as rapid and abrupt as ever. Levin led him 
                into his study. </p>
              <p> His brother dressed with particular care - a thing he never 
                used to do - combed his scanty, lank hair, and, smiling, went 
                upstairs. </p>
              <p> He was in the most affectionate and good-humored mood, just 
                as Levin often remembered him in childhood. He even referred to 
                Sergei Ivanovich without rancor. When he saw Agathya Mikhailovna, 
                he joked with her and asked after the old servants. The news of 
                the death of Parfion Denissich made a painful impression on him. 
                A look of fear crossed his face, but he regained his serenity 
                immediately. </p>
              <p> `Of course he was quite old,' he said, and changed the subject. 
                `Well, I'll spend a month or two with you, and then I'm off to 
                Moscow. Do you know, Miaghkov has promised me a place there, and 
                I'm going into the service. Now I'm going to arrange my life quite 
                differently,' he went on. `You know I got rid of that woman.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Marya Nikolaevna? Why, what for?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, she was a horrid woman! She caused me all sorts of annoyances.' 
                But he did not say what the annoyances were. He could not say 
                that he had driven off Marya Nikolaevna because the tea was weak, 
                and, above all, because she would look after him as though he 
                were an invalid. `Besides, I want to turn over a new leaf completely 
                now. I've done silly things, of course, like everyone else, but 
                money's the last consideration; I don't regret it. So long as 
                there's health - and my health, thank God, is quite restored.' 
              </p>
              <p> Levin listened and racked his brains, but could think of nothing 
                to say. Nikolai probably felt the same; he began questioning his 
                brother about his affairs; and Levin was glad to talk about himself, 
                because then he could speak without hypocrisy. He told his brother 
                of his plans and his doings. </p>
              <p> His brother listened, but evidently he was not interested. </p>
              <p> These two men were so akin, so near each other, that the slightest 
                gesture, the tone of voice, told both more than could be said 
                in words. </p>
              <p> Both of them now had only one thought - the illness of Nikolai 
                and the nearness of his death - which stifled all else. But neither 
                of them dared speak of it, and so, whatever they said - without 
                uttering the one thought that filled their minds - was all falsehood. 
                Never had Levin been so glad when the evening was over and it 
                was time to go to bed. Never with any outside person, never on 
                any official visit, had he been so unnatural and false as he was 
                that evening. And the consciousness of this unnaturalness, and 
                the remorse he felt at it, made him even more unnatural. He wanted 
                to weep over his dying, dearly loved brother, and he had to listen 
                and keep on talking of how he meant to live. </p>
              <p> As the house was damp, and only the one bedroom had been kept 
                heated, Levin put his brother to sleep in his own bedroom, behind 
                a partition. </p>
              <p> His brother got into bed, and whether he slept or did not sleep, 
                tossed about like a sick man, coughed, and when he could not get 
                his throat clear, mumbled something. Sometimes when his breathing 
                was painful, he said, `Oh, my God!' Sometimes when he was choking 
                he muttered angrily, `Ah, the devil!' Levin could not sleep for 
                a long while, hearing him. His thoughts were of the most various 
                kinds, but the end of all his thoughts was the same - death. </p>
              <p> Death, the inevitable end of all, for the first time presented 
                itself to him with irresistible force. And death, which was here 
                in this loved brother, groaning half-asleep and from habit calling 
                without distinction on God and the devil, was not so remote as 
                it had hitherto seemed to him. It was in himself, too, that he 
                felt this. If not today, tomorrow; if not tomorrow, in thirty 
                years - wasn't it all the same? And what was this inevitable death 
                - he did not know, had never thought about it, and, what was more, 
                had not the power, had not the courage to think about it. </p>
              <p> `I work, I want to do something, but I had forgotten it must 
                all end; I had forgotten - death.' </p>
              <p> He sat on his bed in the darkness, crouched up, hugging his 
                knees, and, holding his breath from the strain of thought, he 
                pondered. But the more intensely he thought, the clearer it became 
                to him that it was indubitably so, that, in reality, looking upon 
                life, he had forgotten one little fact - that death will come, 
                and all ends; that nothing was even worth beginning, and that 
                there was no helping it anyway. Yes, it was awful, but it was 
                so. </p>
              <p> `But I am alive still. What's to be done now - what's to be 
                done?' he asked in despair. He lighted a candle, got up cautiously, 
                went to the looking glass, and began looking at his face and hair. 
                Yes, there were gray hairs about his temples. He opened his mouth. 
                His back teeth were beginning to decay. He bared his muscular 
                arms. Yes, there was strength in them. But Nikolenka, who lay 
                there breathing with what was left of his lungs, had had a strong, 
                healthy body too. And suddenly he recalled how they used to go 
                to bed together as children, and how they only waited till Fiodor 
                Bogdanich was out of the room to fling pillows at each other and 
                laugh, laugh irrepressibly, so that even their awe of Fiodor Bogdanich 
                could not check the effervescing, overbrimming sense of life and 
                happiness. `And now that warped, hollow chest... And I, not knowing 
                what will become of me, or wherefore....' </p>
              <p> `K-ha! K-ha! Damnation! Why do you keep fidgeting - why don't 
                you go to sleep?' his brother's voice called to him. </p>
              <p> `Oh, I don't know; I'm not sleepy.' </p>
              <p> `I have had a good sleep, I'm not in a sweat now. Just see, 
                feel my shirt - there's no sweat, is there?' </p>
              <p> Levin felt it, withdrew behind the partition, and put out the 
                candle, but for a long while he could not sleep. The question 
                how to live had hardly begun to grow a little clearer to him, 
                when a new, insolvable question presented itself - death. </p>
              <p> `Why, he's dying - yes, he'll die in the spring; and how is 
                one to help him? What can I say to him? What do I know about it? 
                I'd even forgotten the very fact of it.' </p>

              <p><br>
                The external relations of Alexei Alexandrovich and his wife had 
                remained unchanged. The sole difference lay in the fact that he 
                was more busily occupied than ever. As in former years, at the 
                beginning of the spring he had gone to a foreign watering place 
                for the sake of his health, being deranged every year with his 
                strenuous winter work. And just as always he returned in July 
                and at once fell to his usual work with increased energy. Just 
                as always, too, his wife had moved for the summer to a villa out 
                of town, while he remained in Peterburg. </p>
              <p>From the date of their conversation after the party at Princess 
                Tverskaia's he had never spoken again to Anna of his suspicions 
                and his jealousies, and that habitual tone of his of bantering 
                mimicry was the most convenient tone possible for his present 
                attitude to his wife. He was a little colder to his wife. He simply 
                seemed to be slightly displeased with her for that first midnight 
                conversation, which she had repelled. In his attitude to her there 
                was a shade of vexation, but nothing more. `You would not be open 
                with me,' he seemed to say, mentally addressing her; `so much 
                the worse for you. Now you may beg as you please, but I won't 
                be open with you. So much the worse for you!' he said mentally, 
                like a man who, after vainly attempting to extinguish a fire, 
                should fly in a rage with his vain efforts and say, `Oh, very 
                well then! You shall burn for this!' </p>
              <p> This man, so subtle and astute in official life, did not realize 
                all the insanity of such an attitude to his wife. He did not realize 
                it, because it was too terrible to him to realize his actual position, 
                and he shut down and locked and sealed up in his heart that secret 
                place where lay hid his feelings toward his family - that is, 
                his wife and son. He who had been such a considerate father, had 
                from the end of that winter become peculiarly frigid to his son, 
                and adopted to him just the same bantering tone as he used with 
                his wife. `Aha, young man!' was the greeting with which he met 
                him. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich asserted, and believed, that he had never 
                in any previous year had so much official business as that year. 
                But he was not aware that he sought work for himself that year, 
                that this was one of the means for keeping shut that secret place 
                where lay hid his feelings toward his wife and son, and his thoughts 
                about them, which became more terrible the longer they lay there. 
                If anyone had had the right to ask Alexei Alexandrovich what he 
                thought of his wife's behavior, the mild and peaceable Alexei 
                Alexandrovich would have made no answer, but he would have been 
                greatly angered with any man who should question him on that subject. 
                It was precisely for this reason that there came into Alexei Alexandrovich's 
                face a look of haughtiness and severity whenever anyone inquired 
                after his wife's health. Alexei Alexandrovich did not want to 
                think at all about his wife's behavior and feelings, and he actually 
                succeeded in not thinking about them at all. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich's permanent summer villa was in Peterhof, 
                and the Countess Lidia Ivanovna used to spend the summer there, 
                close to Anna, and constantly seeing her. That year Countess Lidia 
                Ivanovna declined to settle in Peterhof, did not call once at 
                Anna Arkadyevna's, and had hinted to Alexei Alexandrovich about 
                the unsuitability of Anna's close intimacy with Betsy and Vronsky. 
                Alexei Alexandrovich had sternly cut her short, roundly declaring 
                his wife to be above suspicion, and from that time began to avoid 
                Countess Lidia Ivanovna. He did not want to see, and did not see, 
                that many people in society cast dubious glances on his wife; 
                he did not want to understand, and did not understand, why his 
                wife had so particularly insisted on staying at Tsarskoe, where 
                Betsy was staying, and not far from the camp of Vronsky's regiment. 
                He did not allow himself to think about it, and he did not think 
                about it; but, all the same, though he never admitted it to himself, 
                and had no proofs, nor even suspicious evidence, at the bottom 
                of his heart he knew beyond all doubt that he was a deceived husband, 
                and he was profoundly miserable about it. </p>
              <p> How often during those eight years of happy life with his wife 
                had Alexei Alexandrovich looked at other men's faithless wives 
                and other deceived husbands and asked himself: `How can people 
                descend to that? How is it they don't put an end to such a hideous 
                situation?' But now, when the misfortune had come upon himself, 
                he was so far from thinking of putting an end to the situation 
                that he would not recognize it at all - would not recognize it 
                just because it was too awful, too unnatural. </p>
              <p> Since his return from abroad Alexei Alexandrovich had been twice 
                at their country villa. Once he dined there, another time he spent 
                the evening there with a party of friends, but he had not once 
                stayed the night there, as it had been his habit to do in previous 
                years. </p>
              <p> The day of the races had been a very busy day for Alexei Alexandrovich; 
                but when sketching out the day in the morning he made up his mind 
                to go immediately after his early dinner, to their summer villa 
                to see his wife and from there to the races, which all the Court 
                were to witness, and at which he was bound to be present. He was 
                going to see his wife, because he had determined to see her once 
                a week to keep up appearances. And besides, on that day, as it 
                was the fifteenth, he had to give his wife some money for her 
                expenses, according to their usual arrangement. </p>
              <p> With his habitual control over his thoughts, though he thought 
                all this about his wife, he did not let his thoughts stray further 
                in regard to her. </p>
              <p> That morning was a very full one for Alexei Alexandrovich. The 
                evening before, Countess Lidia Ivanovna had sent him a pamphlet 
                by a celebrated traveler in China, who was staying in Peterburg, 
                and with it she enclosed a note begging him to see the traveler 
                himself, as he was an extremely interesting person from various 
                points of view, and likely to be useful. Alexei Alexandrovich 
                had not had time to read the pamphlet through in the evening, 
                and finished it in the morning. Then people began arriving with 
                petitions, and then came the reports, interviews, appointments, 
                dismissals, apportionment of rewards, pensions, payments, papers 
                - the workday round, as Alexei Alexandrovich called it, that always 
                took up so much time. Then there was a private business of his 
                own, a visit from the doctor, and from the steward who managed 
                his property. The steward did not take up much time. He simply 
                gave Alexei Alexandrovich the money he needed, together with a 
                brief statement of the position of his affairs, which was not 
                altogether satisfactory, as during that year, owing to increased 
                expenses, more had been paid out than usual, and there was a deficit. 
                But the doctor, a celebrated Peterburg doctor, who was an intimate 
                acquaintance of Alexei Alexandrovich, had taken up a great deal 
                of time. Alexei Alexandrovich had not expected him that day, and 
                was surprised at his visit, and still more so when the doctor 
                questioned him very carefully about his health, listened to his 
                breathing, and tapped at his liver. Alexei Alexandrovich did not 
                know that his friend Lidia Ivanovna, noticing that he was not 
                as well as usual that year, had begged the doctor to go and examine 
                him. `Do this for my sake,' the Countess Lidia Ivanovna had said 
                to him. </p>
              <p> `I will do it for the sake of Russia, Countess,' replied the 
                doctor. </p>
              <p> `A priceless man!' said the Countess Lidia Ivanovna. </p>
              <p> The doctor was extremely dissatisfied with Alexei Alexandrovich. 
                He found the liver considerably enlarged, and the digestive powers 
                weakened, while the course of mineral waters had been quite without 
                effect. He prescribed more physical exercise as far as possible, 
                and as far as possible less mental strain, and above all no worry 
                - in other words, just what was as much out of Alexei Alexandrovich's 
                power as abstaining from breathing. Then he withdrew, leaving 
                in Alexei Alexandrovich an unpleasant sense that something was 
                wrong with him, and that there was no chance of curing it. </p>
              <p> As he was coming away, the doctor chanced to meet on the steps 
                an acquaintance of his, Sludin, who was head clerk in Alexei Alexandrovich's 
                office. They had been comrades at the university, and, though 
                they rarely met, they thought highly of each other and were excellent 
                friends, and hence there was no one to whom the doctor would have 
                given his opinion of a patient so freely as to Sludin. </p>
              <p> `How glad I am you've been seeing him!' said Sludin. `He's not 
                well, and I fancy... Well, what do you think of him?' </p>
              <p> `I'll tell you,' said the doctor, beckoning over Sludin's head 
                to his coachman to bring the carriage round. `It's just this,' 
                said the doctor, taking a finger of his kid glove in his white 
                hands and pulling it, `if you don't strain the strings, and then 
                try to break them, you'll find it a difficult job; but strain 
                a string to its very utmost, and the mere weight of one finger 
                on the strained string will snap it. And with his close assiduity, 
                his conscientious devotion to his work, he's strained to the utmost; 
                and there's some outside burden weighing on him, and that not 
                a light one,' concluded the doctor, raising his eyebrows significantly. 
                `Will you be at the races?' he added, as he came down to his carriage. 
                `Yes, yes, to be sure; it does waste a lot of time,' the doctor 
                responded vaguely to some reply of Sludin's he had not caught. 
              </p>
              <p> Directly after the doctor, who had taken up so much time, came 
                the celebrated traveler, and Alexei Alexandrovich, by means of 
                the pamphlet he had only just finished reading, and his previous 
                acquaintance with the subject, impressed the traveler by the depth 
                of his knowledge of the subject and the breadth and enlightenment 
                of his view of it. </p>
              <p> At the same time with the traveler there was announced a provincial 
                marshal of nobility on a visit to Peterburg, with whom Alexei 
                Alexandrovich had to have some conversation. After his departure, 
                he had to finish the daily routine of business with his head clerk, 
                and then he still had to drive round to call on a certain personage 
                on a matter of grave and serious import. Alexei Alexandrovich 
                hardly managed to be back by five o'clock, his dinner hour, and, 
                after dining with his head clerk, he invited him to drive with 
                him to his summer villa and to the races. </p>
              <p> Though he did not acknowledge it to himself, Alexei Alexandrovich 
                always tried nowadays to secure the presence of a third person 
                in his interviews with his wife. </p>

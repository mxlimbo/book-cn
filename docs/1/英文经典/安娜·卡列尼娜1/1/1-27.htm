              <p><br>
                The house was big and old-fashioned, and Levin, though he lived 
                alone, heated and used the whole house. He knew that this was 
                stupid, he knew that it was even wrong, and contrary to his present 
                new plans, but this house was a whole world to Levin. It was the 
                world in which his father and mother had lived and died. They 
                had lived just the life that to Levin seemed the ideal of perfection, 
                and that he had dreamed of renewing with his wife, with his family. 
                <br>
                Levin scarcely remembered his mother. His conception of her was 
                for him a sacred memory, and his future wife was bound to be, 
                in his imagination, a repetition of that exquisite, holy ideal 
                of a woman that his mother had been. </p>
              <p> He was so far from conceiving of love for woman apart from marriage 
                that he positively pictured to himself first the family, and only 
                secondarily the woman who would give him a family. His ideas of 
                marriage were, consequently, quite unlike those of the great majority 
                of his acquaintances, for whom getting married was merely one 
                of the many affairs of everyday life. For Levin it was the chief 
                affair of life, on which its whole happiness turned. And now he 
                had to give up that! </p>
              <p> When he had gone into the second drawing room, where he always 
                had tea, and had settled himself in his armchair with a book, 
                and Agathya Mikhailovna had brought him tea, and with her usual, 
                `Well, I'll stay a while, my dear,' had taken a chair at the window, 
                he felt that, however strange it might be, he had not parted from 
                his daydreams, and that he could not live without them. Whether 
                with her, or with another - it was still bound to be. He was reading 
                his book, pondering on what he was reading, and pausing to listen 
                to Agathya Mikhailovna, who gossiped away without flagging, and 
                yet, with all that, all sorts of pictures of his work and a future 
                family life rose disconnectedly before his imagination. He felt 
                that in the depth of his soul something was steadying, settling 
                down, and abating. </p>
              <p> He heard Agathya Mikhailovna talking of how Prokhor had forgotten 
                his duty to God, and, with the money Levin had given him to buy 
                a horse, had been drinking without a letup, and had beaten his 
                wife till he'd half-killed her. He listened, and read his book, 
                and recalled the whole train of ideas suggested by his reading. 
                It was Tyndall's Treatise on Heat. He recalled his own criticisms 
                of Tyndall for his self-complacency in the cleverness of his experiments, 
                and for his lack of philosophic insight. And suddenly there floated 
                into his mind the joyful thought: `In two year's time I shall 
                have two Dutch cows in my herd; Pava herself will perhaps still 
                be alive; a dozen young daughters of Berkoot, and these three 
                added for show - it would be marvelous!' He took up his book again. 
                `Now well, electricity and heat are the same thing; but is it 
                possible to substitute one quantity for the other in an equation 
                for the solution of any problem? No. Well, then what of it? The 
                connection between all the forces of nature is felt instinctively, 
                anyway.... It'll be particularly pleasant when Pava's daughter 
                will be a red-dappled cow like all the herd, to which the other 
                three should be added! Splendid! I'll go out with my wife and 
                visitors to meet the herd.... My wife says, ``Kostia and I looked 
                after that heifer like a child.'' ``How can it interest you so 
                much?'' says a visitor. ``Everything that interests him, interests 
                me.'' But who will she be?' And he remembered what had happened 
                at Moscow.... `Well, there's nothing to be done.... It's not my 
                fault. But now everything shall go on in a new way. It's nonsense 
                to pretend that life won't let one, that the past won't let one. 
                One must struggle to live better - far better....' He raised his 
                head, and sank into thought. Old Laska, who had not yet fully 
                digested her delight at his return, and had run out into the yard 
                to bark, came back wagging her tail, and crept up to him, bringing 
                in the scent of the fresh air, put her head under his hand, and 
                yelped plaintively, asking to be stroked. </p>
              <p> `If she could but speak,' said Agathya Mikhailovna. `Even though 
                it's a dog... Yet she understands that her master's come home, 
                and that he's low-spirited.' </p>
              <p> `Why low-spirited?' </p>
              <p> `Do you suppose I don't see it, my dear? It's high time I should 
                know the gentlefolk. Why, I've grown up from a little thing with 
                them. Never mind, sir, so long as one has health and a clear conscience.' 
              </p>
              <p> Levin looked intently at her, surprised at how well she had 
                fathomed his thoughts. </p>
              <p> `Shall I fetch you another cup?' she asked and, taking his cup, 
                went out. </p>
              <p> Laska kept poking her head under his hand. He stroked her, and 
                she promptly curled up at his feet, laying her head on a protruding 
                hand-paw. And in token of all now being well and satisfactory, 
                she opened her mouth a little, smacked her lips, and settling 
                her sticky lips more comfortably about her old teeth, she sank 
                into blissful respose. Levin watched her last movements attentively. 
              </p>
              <p> `That's what I'll do,' he said to himself; `that's what I'll 
                do! Never mind.... All's well.' </p>

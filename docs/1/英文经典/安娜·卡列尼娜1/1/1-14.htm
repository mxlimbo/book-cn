              <p><br>
                But at that very moment the Princess came in. There was a look 
                of horror on her face when she beheld them alone, and saw their 
                disturbed faces. Levin bowed to her, and said nothing. Kitty neither 
                spoke nor lifted her eyes. `Thank God, she has refused him,' thought 
                the mother, and her face lighted up with the habitual smile with 
                which she greeted her guests on Thursdays. She sat down and began 
                questioning Levin about his life in the country. He sat down again, 
                waiting for other visitors to arrive, in order to go off unnoticed. 
              </p>
              <p>Five minutes later there came in a friend of Kitty's, married 
                the preceding winter - Countess Nordstone. </p>
              <p> She was a thin, sallow, sickly and nervous woman, with brilliant 
                black eyes. She was fond of Kitty, and her affection for her showed 
                itself, as the affection of married women for girls always does, 
                in the desire to make a match for Kitty after her own ideal of 
                married happiness; she wanted her to marry Vronsky. Levin she 
                had often met at the Shcherbatsky's early in the winter, and she 
                had always disliked him. Her invariable and favorite pursuit, 
                when they met, consisted in making fun of him. </p>
              <p> `I do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his 
                grandeur, or breaks off his wise conversation with me because 
                I'm a fool, or is condescending to me. I like that so - to see 
                him condescending! I am so glad he can't bear me,' she used to 
                say of him. </p>
              <p> She was right, for Levin actually could not bear her, and despised 
                her for what she was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic 
                - her nervousness, her refined contempt and indifference for everything 
                coarse and earthly. </p>
              <p> The Countess Nordstone and Levin had got into that mutual relation 
                not infrequently seen in society, when two persons, who remain 
                externally on friendly terms, despise each other to such a degree 
                that they cannot even take each other seriously, and cannot even 
                be offended by each other. </p>
              <p> The Countess Nordstone pounced upon Levin at once. </p>
              <p> `Ah, Constantin Dmitrievich! So you've come back to our corrupt 
                Babylon,' she said, giving him her tiny, yellow hand and recalling 
                what he had chanced to say early in the winter, that Moscow was 
                a Babylon. `Come, is Babylon reformed, or have you degenerated?' 
                she added, glancing with a simper at Kitty. </p>
              <p> `It's very flattering for me, Countess, that you remember my 
                words so well,' responded Levin, who had succeeded in recovering 
                his composure, and at once from habit dropped into his tone of 
                joking hostility to the Countess Nordstone. `They must certainly 
                make a great impression on you.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, I should think so! I always note everything down. Well, 
                Kitty, have you been skating again?...' </p>
              <p> And she began talking to Kitty. Awkward as it was for Levin 
                to withdraw now, it would still have been easier for him to perpetrate 
                this awkwardness than to remain all the evening and see Kitty, 
                who glanced at him now and then and avoided his eyes. He was on 
                the point of getting up, when the Princess, noticing that he was 
                silent, addressed him. </p>
              <p> `Shall you be long in Moscow? You're busy with the Zemstvo, 
                though, aren't you, and can't be away for long?' </p>
              <p> `No, Princess, I'm no longer a member of the board,' he said. 
                `I have come up for a few days.' </p>
              <p> `There's something the matter with him,' thought Countess Nordstone, 
                glancing at his stern, serious face. `He isn't in his old argumentative 
                mood. But I'll draw him out. I do love making a fool of him before 
                Kitty, and I'll do it.' </p>
              <p> `Constantin Dmitrievich,' she said to him, `do explain to me 
                please, what does it mean - you know all about such things - in 
                our village of Kaluga all the peasants and all the women have 
                drunk up all they possessed, and now they can't pay us any rent. 
                What's the meaning of that? You always praise the mouzhiks so.' 
              </p>
              <p> At that instant another lady came into the room, and Levin got 
                up. </p>
              <p> `Excuse me, Countess, but I really know nothing about it, and 
                can't tell you anything,' he said, and looked round at the officer 
                who came in behind the lady. </p>
              <p> `That must be Vronsky,' thought Levin, and, to be sure of it, 
                glanced at Kitty. She had already had time to look at Vronsky, 
                and looked round at Levin. And, simply from the look in her eyes, 
                that grew unconsciously brighter, Levin knew that she loved this 
                man - knew it as surely as if she had told him in so many words. 
                But what sort of a man was he? </p>
              <p> Now, whether for good or for ill, Levin could not choose but 
                remain; he must find out what the man was like whom she loved. 
              </p>
              <p> There are people who, on meeting a successful rival, no matter 
                in what, are at once disposed to turn their backs on everything 
                good in him, and to see only what is bad. There are people who, 
                on the contrary, desire above all to find in that successful rival 
                the qualities by which he has worsted them, and seek with a throbbing 
                ache at heart only what is good. Levin belonged to the second 
                class. But he had no difficulty in finding what was good and attractive 
                in Vronsky. It was apparent at the first glance. Vronsky was a 
                squarely built, dark man, not very tall, with a good-humored, 
                handsome and exceedingly calm and firm face. Everything about 
                his face and figure, from his short-cropped black hair and freshly 
                shaven chin down to his loosely fitting, brand-new uniform, was 
                simple and at the same time elegant. Making way for the lady who 
                had come in, Vronsky went up to the Princess and then to Kitty. 
              </p>
              <p> As he approached her, his beautiful eyes shone with an especially 
                tender light, and with a faint, happy and modestly triumphant 
                smile (so it seemed to Levin), bowing carefully and respectfully 
                over her, he held out his small broad hand to her. </p>
              <p> Greeting and saying a few words to everyone, he sat down without 
                once glancing at Levin, who had never taken his eyes off him. 
              </p>
              <p> `Let me introduce you,' said the Princess, indicating Levin. 
                `Constantin Dmitrievich Levin, Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky.' 
              </p>
              <p> Vronsky got up and, looking cordially at Levin, shook hands 
                with him. </p>
              <p> `I believe I was to have dined with you this winter,' he said, 
                smiling his simple and open smile; `but you had unexpectedly left 
                for the country.' </p>
              <p> `Constantin Dmitrievich despises and hates the town, and us 
                townspeople,' said Countess Nordstone. </p>
              <p> `My words must make a deep impression on you, since you remember 
                them so well,' said Levin, and, suddenly becoming conscious that 
                he had said just the same thing before, he reddened. </p>
              <p> Vronsky looked at Levin and Countess Nordstone, and smiled. 
              </p>
              <p> `Are you always in the country?' he inquired. `I should think 
                it must be dull in the winter.' </p>
              <p> `It's not dull if one has work to do; besides, one's not dull 
                by oneself,' Levin replied abruptly. </p>
              <p> `I am fond of the country,' said Vronsky, noticing, yet affecting 
                not to notice, Levin's tone. </p>
              <p> `But I hope, Count, you would not consent to live in the country 
                always,' said Countess Nordstone. </p>
              <p> `I don't know; I have never tried for long. I experienced a 
                queer feeling once,' he went on. `I never longed so for the country 
                - Russian country, with bast shoes and peasants - as when I was 
                spending a winter with my mother in Nice. Nice itself is dull 
                enough, you know. And, indeed, Naples and Sorrento are only pleasant 
                for a short time. And it's just there that Russia comes back to 
                one's mind most vividly, and especially the country. It's as though...' 
              </p>
              <p> He talked on, addressing both Kitty and Levin, turning his serene, 
                friendly eyes from one to the other, and saying obviously just 
                what came into his head. </p>
              <p> Noticing that Countess Nordstone wanted to say something, he 
                stopped short without finishing what he had begun, and listened 
                attentively to her. </p>
              <p> The conversation did not flag for an instant, so that the old 
                Princess, who always kept in reserve, in case a subject should 
                be lacking, two heavy guns - the classical and professional education, 
                and universal military service - had not to move out either of 
                them, while Countess Nordstone had no chance of chaffing Levin. 
              </p>
              <p> Levin wanted to, and could not, take part in the general conversation; 
                saying to himself every instant, `Now go,' he still did not go, 
                as though waiting for something. </p>
              <p> The conversation fell upon table turning and spirits, and Countess 
                Nordstone, who believed in spiritualism, began to describe the 
                miracles she had seen. </p>
              <p> `Ah, Countess, you really must take me; for pity's sake do take 
                me to see them! I have never seen anything extraordinary, though 
                I am always on the lookout for it everywhere,' said Vronsky, smiling. 
              </p>
              <p> `Very well - next Saturday,' answered Countess Nordstone. `But 
                you, Constantin Dmitrievich - are you a believer?' she asked Levin. 
              </p>
              <p> `Why do you ask me? You know what I shall say.' </p>
              <p> `But I want to hear your opinion.' </p>
              <p> `My opinion,' answered Levin, `is merely that this table turning 
                proves that educated society - so called - is no higher than the 
                peasants. They believe in the evil eye, and in witchcraft and 
                conjurations, while we...' </p>
              <p> `Oh, then you aren't a believer?' </p>
              <p> `I can't believe, Countess.' </p>
              <p> `But if I've seen for myself?' </p>
              <p> `The peasant women, too, tell us they have seen hobgoblins.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Then you think I tell a lie?' </p>
              <p> And she laughed a mirthless laugh. </p>
              <p> `Oh, no, Masha, Constantin Dmitrievich merely said he could 
                not believe,' said Kitty, blushing for Levin, and Levin saw this, 
                and, still more exasperated, would have answered; but Vronsky 
                with his bright frank smile rushed to the support of the conversation, 
                which was threatening to become disagreeable. </p>
              <p> `You do not admit the possibility at all?' he queried. `But 
                why not? We admit the existence of electricity, of which we know 
                nothing. Why should there not be some new force, still unknown 
                to us, which...' </p>
              <p> `When electricity was discovered,' Levin interrupted hurriedly, 
                `it was only the phenomenon that was discovered, and it was unknown 
                from what it proceeded and what were its effects, and ages passed 
                before its applications were conceived. But the spiritualists, 
                on the contrary, have begun with tables writing for them, and 
                spirits appearing to them, and have only later started saying 
                that it is an unknown force.' </p>
              <p> Vronsky listened attentively to Levin, as he always did listen, 
                obviously interested in his words. </p>
              <p> `Yes, but the spiritualists say we don't know at present what 
                this force is, but there is a force, and these are the conditions 
                in which it acts. Let the scientific men find out what the force 
                consists of. No, I don't see why there should not be a new force, 
                if it...' </p>
              <p> `Why, because with electricity,' Levin interrupted again, `every 
                time you rub tar against wool, a certain phenomenon is manifested; 
                but in this case it does not happen every time, and so it follows 
                it is not a natural phenomenon.' </p>
              <p> Feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too 
                serious for a drawing room, Vronsky made no rejoinder, but by 
                way of trying to change the conversation, he smiled brightly, 
                and turned to the ladies. </p>
              <p> `Do let us try at once, Countess,' he said; but Levin would 
                finish saying what he thought. </p>
              <p> `I think,' he went on, `that this attempt of the spiritualists 
                to explain their miracles as some sort of new natural force is 
                most futile. They boldly talk of spiritual force, and then try 
                to subject it to material experiment.' </p>
              <p> Everyone was waiting for him to finish, and he felt this. </p>
              <p> `Why, I think you would be a first-rate medium,' said Countess 
                Nordstone, `there's something enthusiastic about you.' </p>
              <p> Levin opened his mouth, was about to say something, reddened, 
                and said nothing. </p>
              <p> `Do let us try table turning at once, please,' said Vronsky. 
                `Princess, will you allow it? </p>
              <p> And Vronsky stood up, looking about for a little table. </p>
              <p> Kitty got up to fetch a table, and, as she passed, her eyes 
                met Levin's. She felt for him with her whole heart, the more because 
                she was pitying him for a suffering of which she was herself the 
                cause. `If you can forgive me, forgive me,' said her eyes, `I 
                am so happy.' </p>
              <p> `I hate them all, and you, and myself,' his eyes responded, 
                and he took up his hat. But he was not destined to escape. just 
                as they were arranging themselves round the table, and Levin was 
                on the point of retiring, the old Prince came in, and, after greeting 
                the ladies, addressed Levin. </p>
              <p> `Ah!' he began joyously. `Been here long, my boy? I didn't even 
                know you were in town. Very glad to see you.' The old Prince embraced 
                Levin, and, talking to him, did not observe Vronsky, who had risen, 
                and was calmly waiting till the Prince should turn to him. </p>
              <p> Kitty felt how grievous her father's cordiality was to Levin 
                after what had happened. She saw, too, how coldly her father responded 
                at last to Vronsky's bow, and how Vronsky looked with amiable 
                perplexity at her father, trying and failing to understand how 
                and why anyone could be hostilely disposed toward him, and she 
                flushed. </p>
              <p> `Prince, let us have Constantin Dmitrievich,' said Countess 
                Nordstone, `we want to try an experiment.' </p>
              <p> `What experiment? Table turning? Well, you must excuse me, ladies 
                and gentlemen, but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring 
                game,' said the old Prince, looking at Vronsky, and guessing that 
                it had been his suggestion. `There's some sense in that, anyway.' 
              </p>
              <p> Vronsky looked wonderingly at the Prince with his firm eyes, 
                and, with a faint smile, began immediately talking to Countess 
                Nordstone of the great ball that was to come off next week. </p>
              <p> `I hope you will be there?' he said to Kitty. As soon as the 
                old Prince turned away from him, Levin slipped out unnoticed, 
                and the last impression he carried away with him of that evening 
                was the smiling, happy face of Kitty answering Vronsky's inquiry 
                about the ball. </p>

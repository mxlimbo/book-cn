              <p align="center" class="h">Chapter 8</p>
              <p><br>
                Toward the end of May, when everything had been more or less satisfactorily 
                arranged, she received her husband's answer to her complaints 
                of the disorganized state of things in the country. He wrote begging 
                her forgiveness for not having thought of everything before, and 
                promised to come down at the first chance. This chance did not 
                present itself, and till the beginning of June Darya Alexandrovna 
                stayed alone in the country. </p>
              <p>On the Sunday in St. Peter's week Darya Alexandrovna drove to 
                mass to have all her children take the sacrament. Darya Alexandrovna 
                in her intimate, philosophical talks with her sister, her mother, 
                and her friends very often astonished them by the freedom of her 
                views in regard to religion. She had a strange religion, all her 
                own, of the transmigration of souls, in which she had firm faith, 
                troubling herself little about the dogmas of the Church. But in 
                her family she was strict in carrying out all that was required 
                by the Church - and not merely in order to set an example, but 
                with all her heart. The fact that the children had not been at 
                the sacrament for nearly a year worried her extremely, and with 
                the full approval and sympathy of Matriona Philimonovna she decided 
                that this should take place now, in the summer. </p>
              <p> For several days before Darya Alexandrovna was busily deliberating 
                on how to dress all the children. Frocks were made, or altered 
                and washed, seams and flounces were let out, buttons were sewn 
                on and ribbons got ready. One dress, Tania's, which the English 
                governess had undertaken, cost Darya Alexandrovna much loss of 
                temper. The English governess in altering it had made the seams 
                in the wrong place, had taken up the sleeves too much, and altogether 
                spoiled the dress. It was so narrow on Tania's shoulders that 
                it was quite painful to look at her. But Matriona Philimonovna 
                had the happy thought of putting in gussets, and adding a little 
                shoulder-cape. The dress was set right, but there was nearly a 
                quarrel with the English governess. In the morning, however, all 
                was happily arranged, and about nine o'clock - the time at which 
                they had asked the priest to wait for them for the mass - the 
                children in their new dresses stood with beaming faces on the 
                step before the carriage, waiting for their mother. </p>
              <p> In the carriage, instead of the restive Raven, they had harnessed, 
                thanks to the representations of Matriona Philimonovna, the bailiff's 
                horse, Brownie, and Darya Alexandrovna, delayed by anxiety over 
                her own attire, came out and got in, dressed in a white muslin 
                gown. </p>
              <p> Darya Alexandrovna had done her hair, and dressed with care 
                and excitement. In the old days she had dressed for her own sake, 
                to look pretty and be admired; later on, as she got older, dress 
                became more and more distasteful to her; she saw that she was 
                losing her good looks. But now she began to feel pleasure and 
                interest in dress again. Now she did not dress for her own sake, 
                nor for the sake of her own beauty, but simply that, as the mother 
                of those exquisite creatures, she might not spoil the general 
                effect. And looking at herself for the last time in the looking 
                glass she was satisfied with herself. She looked well. Not as 
                well as she wished to look in the old days, at a ball, but well 
                for the object she now had in view. </p>
              <p> In the church there was no one but the peasants, the servants, 
                and their womenfolk. But Darya Alexandrovna saw, or fancied she 
                saw, the sensation produced by her children and herself. The children 
                were not only beautiful to look at in their smart little dresses, 
                but they were charming in the way they behaved. Aliosha, it is 
                true, did not stand quite correctly; he kept turning round, trying 
                to look at his little jacket from behind; but all the same he 
                was wonderfully sweet. Tania behaved like a grown-up person, and 
                looked after the little ones. And the smallest, Lily, was bewitching 
                in her naive astonishment at everything, and it was difficult 
                not to smile when, after taking the sacrament, she said in English, 
                `Please, some more.' </p>
              <p> On the way home the children felt that something solemn had 
                happened, and were very sedate. </p>
              <p> Everything went happily at home too; but at lunch Grisha began 
                whistling, and, what was worse, was disobedient to the English 
                governess, and was forbidden to have any tart. Darya Alexandrovna 
                would not have let things go as far as the punishment on such 
                a day had she been present; but she had to support the English 
                governess's authority, and she upheld her decision that Grisha 
                should have no tart. This rather spoiled the general good humor. 
              </p>
              <p> Grisha cried, declaring that Nikolinka had whistled too, yet 
                was not punished, and that he wasn't crying for the tart - he 
                didn't care - but at being unjustly treated. This was really too 
                tragic, and Darya Alexandrovna made up her mind to persuade the 
                English governess to forgive Grisha, and she went to speak to 
                her. But on her way, as she passed the drawing room, she beheld 
                a scene, filling her heart with such pleasure that the tears came 
                into her eyes, and she forgave the delinquent herself. </p>
              <p> The culprit was sitting at the window in the corner of the drawing 
                room; beside him was standing Tania with a plate. On the pretext 
                of wanting to give some dinner to her dolls, she had asked the 
                governess's permission to take her share of tart to the nursery, 
                and had taken it instead to her brother. While still weeping over 
                the injustice of his punishment, he was eating the tart, and kept 
                saying through his sobs, `Eat yourself; let's eat it together... 
                together.' </p>
              <p> Tania had at first been under the influence of her pity for 
                Grisha, then of a sense of her noble action, and tears were standing 
                in her eyes too; but she did not refuse, and ate her share. </p>
              <p> On catching sight of their mother they were dismayed, but, looking 
                into her face, they saw they were not doing wrong. They burst 
                out laughing, and, with their mouths full of tart, they began 
                wiping their smiling lips with their hands, and smearing their 
                radiant faces all over with tears and jam. </p>
              <p> `Mercy! Your new white frock - Tania! Grisha!' said their mother, 
                trying to save the frock, but with tears in her eyes, smiling 
                a blissful, rapturous smile. </p>
              <p> The new frocks were taken off, and orders were given for the 
                little girls to have their blouses put on, and the boys their 
                old jackets, and the wide droshky to be harnessed - with Brownie, 
                to the bailiff's annoyance, again in the shafts - to drive out 
                for mushroom picking and bathing. A roar of delighted shrieks 
                arose in the nursery, and never ceased till they had set off for 
                the bathing place. </p>
              <p> They gathered a whole basketful of mushrooms; even Lily found 
                a birch mushroom. It had always happened before that Miss Hoole 
                found them and pointed them out to her; but this time she found 
                a big one quite by herself, and there was a general scream of 
                delight; `Lily has found a mushroom!' </p>
              <p> Then they reached the river, put the horses under the birch 
                trees, and went to the bathing place. The coachman, Terentii, 
                hitched the horses, who kept whisking away the horseflies, to 
                a tree, and, treading down the grass, lay down in the shade of 
                a birch and smoked his shag, while the never-ceasing shrieks of 
                delight of the children floated across to him from the bathing 
                place. </p>
              <p> Though it was hard work to look after all the children and restrain 
                their pranks, though it was difficult, too, to keep one's head 
                and not mix up all the stockings, little breeches, and shoes for 
                the different legs, and to undo and to do up again all the tapes 
                and buttons, Darya Alexandrovna, who had always liked bathing 
                herself, and believed it to be very good for the children, enjoyed 
                nothing so much as bathing with all the children. To go over all 
                those fat little legs, pulling on their stockings, to take in 
                her arms and dip those little naked bodies, and to hear their 
                screams of delight and alarm, to see the breathless faces with 
                wide-open, scared, and happy eyes of all her splashing cherubs, 
                was a great pleasure to her. </p>
              <p> When half the children had been dressed, some peasant women 
                in holiday dress, out picking herbs, came up to the bathing shed 
                and stopped shyly. Matriona Philimonovna called one of them and 
                handed her a sheet and a shirt that had dropped into the water 
                for her to dry them, and Darya Alexandrovna began to talk to the 
                women. At first they laughed behind their hands and did not understand 
                her questions, but soon they grew bolder and began to talk, winning 
                Darya Alexandrovna's heart at once by the genuine admiration of 
                the children that they showed. </p>
              <p> `My, what a beauty! As white as sugar,' said one, admiring Tanechka, 
                and shaking her head, `but thin....' </p>
              <p> `Yes, she has been ill.' </p>
              <p> `Lookee, they've been bathing him too,' said another, pointing 
                to the breast baby. </p>
              <p> `No; he's only three months old,' answered Darya Alexandrovna 
                with pride. </p>
              <p> `You see!' </p>
              <p> `And have you any children?' </p>
              <p> `I've had four; I've two living - a boy and a girl. I weaned 
                her last carnival.' </p>
              <p> `How old is she?' </p>
              <p> `Why, more than one year old.' </p>
              <p> `Why did you nurse her so long?' </p>
              <p> `It's our custom; for three fasts....' </p>
              <p> And the conversation became most interesting to Darya Alexandrovna. 
                What sort of time did she have? What was the matter with the boy? 
                Where was her husband? Did it often happen? </p>
              <p> Darya Alexandrovna felt disinclined to leave the peasant women, 
                so interesting to her was their conversation, so completely identical 
                were all their interests. What pleased her most of all was that 
                she saw clearly what all the women admired more than anything 
                was her having so many children, and such fine ones. The peasant 
                women even made Darya Alexandrovna laugh, and offended the English 
                governess, because she was the cause of the laughter she did not 
                understand. One of the younger women kept staring at the Englishwoman, 
                who was dressing after all the rest, and when she put on her third 
                petticoat she could not refrain from the remark, `My, she keeps 
                putting on and putting on, and she'll never have done!' she said, 
                and they all went off into peals of laughter. </p>

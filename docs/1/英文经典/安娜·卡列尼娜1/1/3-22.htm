              <p><br>
                It was six o'clock already, and so, in order to be there quickly, 
                and at the same time not to drive with his own horses, known to 
                everyone, Vronsky got into Iashvin's hackney coach and told the 
                coachman to drive as quickly as possible. It was a roomy, old-fashioned 
                coach, with seats for four. He sat in one corner, stretched his 
                legs out on the front seat, and sank into deep thought. </p>
              <p>A vague sense of the clearness to which his affairs had been 
                brought, a vague recollection of the friendliness and flattery 
                of Serpukhovskoy, who had considered him a man who was needed, 
                and, most of all, the anticipation of the meeting before him - 
                all blended into a general, joyous sense of life. This feeling 
                was so strong that he could not help smiling. He dropped his legs, 
                crossed one leg over the other knee, and, taking it in his hand, 
                felt the springy muscle of the calf, where it had been grazed 
                the day before by his fall, and, leaning back he drew several 
                deep breaths. </p>
              <p> `I'm happy, very happy!' he said to himself. He had often before 
                had this sense of physical joy in his own body, but he had never 
                felt so fond of himself, of his own body, as at that moment. He 
                enjoyed the slight ache in his strong leg, he enjoyed the muscular 
                sensation of movement in his chest as he breathed. The bright, 
                cold August day, which had made Anna feel so hopeless, seemed 
                to him keenly stimulating, and refreshed his face and neck that 
                still tingled from the cold water. The scent of brilliantine on 
                his mustaches struck him as particularly pleasant in the fresh 
                air. Everything he saw from the carriage window, everything in 
                that cold pure air, in the pale light of the sunset, was as fresh, 
                and gay, and strong as he was himself: the roofs of the houses 
                shining in the rays of the setting sun, the sharp outlines of 
                fences and angles of buildings, the figures of passers-by and 
                carriages that met him now and then, the motionless green of the 
                trees and grass, the fields with evenly drawn furrows of potatoes, 
                and the slanting shadows that fell from the houses, and trees, 
                and bushes, and even from the rows of potatoes - everything was 
                bright like a pretty landscape freshly painted and varnished. 
              </p>
              <p> `Get on, get on!' he said to the driver, putting his head out 
                of the window, and pulling a three-rouble note out of his pocket 
                he handed it to the man as he looked round. The driver's hand 
                fumbled with something at the lamp, the whip cracked, and the 
                coach rolled rapidly along the smooth highroad. </p>
              <p> `I want nothing, nothing but this happiness,' he thought, staring 
                at the bone button of the bell in the space between the windows, 
                and picturing to himself Anna just as he had seen her last time. 
                `And as I go on, I love her more and more. Here's the garden of 
                the Vrede's crown villa. Whereabouts will she be? Where? How? 
                Why did she fix on this place to meet me, and why does she write 
                in Betsy's letter?' he thought, now for the first time wondering 
                at it. But there was now no time for wonder. He called to the 
                driver to stop before reaching the avenue, and opening the door, 
                jumped out of the carriage as it was moving, and went up the avenue 
                that led to the house. There was no one in the avenue; but, looking 
                round to the right, he caught sight of her. Her face was hidden 
                by a veil, but he drank in with glad eyes the special movement 
                in walking, peculiar to her alone, the slope of her shoulders, 
                and the setting of her head, and at once a sort of electric shock 
                ran all over him. With fresh force he felt conscious of himself, 
                from the springy movements of his legs to the movements of his 
                lungs as he breathed, and something set his lips twitching. </p>
              <p> Joining him, she pressed his hand tightly. </p>
              <p> `You're not angry because I sent for you? I absolutely had to 
                see you,' she said; and the serious and set line of her lips, 
                which he saw under the veil, transformed his mood at once. </p>
              <p> `I angry? But how have you come - where?' </p>
              <p> `Never mind,' she said, laying her hand on his arm, `come along, 
                I must talk to you.' </p>
              <p> He saw that something had happened, and that the interview would 
                not be a joyous one. In her presence he had no will of his own: 
                without knowing the grounds of her distress, he already felt the 
                same distress unconsciously passing over him. </p>
              <p> `What is it? What?' he asked her, squeezing her hand with his 
                elbow, and trying to read her thoughts in her face. </p>
              <p> She walked on a few steps in silence, gathering up her courage; 
                then suddenly she stopped. </p>
              <p> `I did not tell you yesterday,' she began, breathing quickly 
                and painfully, `that coming home with Alexei Alexandrovich I told 
                him everything... told him I could not be his wife, that... and 
                told him everything.' </p>
              <p> He heard her, unconsciously bending his whole figure down to 
                her as though hoping in this way to soften the hardness of her 
                position for her. But directly she had said this he suddenly drew 
                himself up, and a proud and hard expression came over his face. 
              </p>
              <p><br>
                `Yes, yes, that's better, a thousand times better! I know how 
                painful it was,' he said. But she was not listening to his words 
                - she was reading his thoughts from the expression of his face. 
                She could not guess that that arose from the first idea that presented 
                itself to Vronsky - that a duel was now inevitable. The idea of 
                a duel had never crossed her mind, and so she put a different 
                interpretation on this passing expression of hardness. </p>
              <p> When she got her husband's letter, she knew then at the bottom 
                of her heart that everything would go on in the old way, that 
                she would not have the strength of will to forego her position, 
                to abandon her son, and to join her lover. The morning spent at 
                Princess Tverskaia's had confirmed her still more in this. But 
                this interview was still of the utmost gravity for her. She hoped 
                that this interview would transform her position, and save her. 
                If on hearing this news he were to say to her resolutely, passionately, 
                without an instant's wavering: `Throw up everything and come with 
                me! she would give up her son and go away with him. But this news 
                had not produced on him the effect she had expected; he simply 
                seemed resentful of some affront. </p>
              <p> `It was not in the least painful for me. It happened of itself,' 
                she said irritably, `and see...' She pulled her husband's letter 
                out of her glove. </p>
              <p> `I understand, I understand,' he interrupted her, taking the 
                letter, but not reading it, and trying to soothe her. `The one 
                thing I longed for, the one thing I prayed for, was to cut short 
                this position, so as to devote my life to your happiness.' </p>
              <p> `Why do you tell me that?' she said. `Do you suppose I can doubt 
                it? If I doubted...' </p>
              <p> `Who's that coming?' said Vronsky suddenly, pointing to two 
                ladies walking toward them. `Perhaps they know us!' and he hurriedly 
                turned off, drawing her after him into a side path. </p>
              <p> `Oh, I don't care!' she said. Her lips were quivering. And he 
                fancied that her eyes looked with strange fury at him from under 
                her veil. `I tell you that's not the point - I can't doubt that; 
                but see what he writes me. Read it.' She stood still again. </p>
              <p> Again, just as at the first moment of hearing of her rupture 
                with her husband, Vronsky, on reading the letter, was unconsciously 
                carried away by the natural sensation aroused in him by his own 
                relation to the injured husband. Now, while he held his letter 
                in his hands, he could not help picturing the challenge, which 
                he would most likely find at home today or tomorrow, and the duel 
                itself, in which, with the same cold and haughty expression that 
                his face was assuming at this moment, he would await the injured 
                husband's shot, after having himself fired into the air. And at 
                that instant there flashed across his mind the thought of what 
                Serpukhovskoy had just said to him, and what he had himself been 
                thinking in the morning - that it was better not to bind himself; 
                and he knew that he could not tell her this thought. </p>
              <p> Having read the letter, he raised his eyes to her, and there 
                was no firmness in them. She saw at once that he had been thinking 
                about it before by himself. She knew that whatever he might say 
                to her, he would not say all he thought. And she knew that her 
                last hope had failed her. This was not what she had been looking 
                for. </p>
              <p> `You see the sort of man he is,' she said, with a shaking voice; 
                `he...' </p>
              <p> `Forgive me, but I rejoice at it,' Vronsky interrupted. `For 
                God's sake, let me finish!' he added, his eyes imploring her to 
                give him time to explain his words. `I rejoice, because things 
                cannot, cannot possibly remain as he supposes.' </p>
              <p> `Why can't they?' Anna said, restraining her tears, and obviously 
                attaching no sort of consequence to what he said. She felt that 
                her fate was sealed. </p>
              <p> Vronsky meant that after the duel - inevitable, he thought - 
                things could not go on as before, but he said something different. 
              </p>
              <p> `It can't go on. I hope that now you will leave him. I hope' 
                - he was confused, and reddened - `that you will let me arrange 
                and plan our life. Tomorrow...' he was beginning. </p>
              <p> She did not let him go on. </p>
              <p> `But my child!' she shrieked. `You see what he writes! I should 
                have to leave him, and I can't and won't do that.' </p>
              <p> `But, for God's sake, which is better? To leave your child, 
                or keep up this degrading situation?' </p>
              <p> `To whom is it degrading?' </p>
              <p> `To all, and most of all to you.' </p>
              <p> `You say degrading... Don't say that. These words have no meaning 
                for me,' she said in a shaking voice. She did not want him now 
                to say what was untrue. She had nothing left her but his love, 
                and she wanted to love him. `Don't you understand that from the 
                day I loved you everything has changed for me? For me there is 
                one thing, and one thing only - your love. If that's mine, I feel 
                so exalted, so strong, that nothing can be degrading to me. I 
                am proud of my position, because... proud of being... proud...' 
                She could not say what she was proud of. Tears of shame and despair 
                choked her utterance. She stood still and sobbed. </p>
              <p> He felt, too, something swelling in his throat and twitching 
                in his nose, and for the first time in his life he felt on the 
                point of weeping. He could not have said exactly what it was touched 
                him so; he felt sorry for her, and he felt he could not help her, 
                and with that he knew that he was to blame for her wretchedness, 
                and that he had done something wrong. </p>
              <p> `Isn't a divorce possible?' he said feebly. She shook her head, 
                without answering. `Couldn't you take your son, and still leave 
                him? </p>
              <p> `Yes; but it all depends on him. Now I must go to him,' she 
                said shortly. Her presentiment that all would again go on in the 
                old way had not deceived her. </p>
              <p> `On Tuesday I shall be in Peterburg, and everything can be settled.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes,' she said. `But don't let us talk any more of it.' </p>
              <p> Anna's carriage, which she had sent away, and ordered to come 
                back to the little gate of the Vrede garden, drove up. Anna said 
                good-by to Vronsky, and drove home. </p>

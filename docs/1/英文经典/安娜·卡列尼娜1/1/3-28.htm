              <p><br>
                Levin was insufferably bored that evening with the ladies; he 
                was stirred as he had never been before by the idea that the dissatisfaction 
                he was feeling with his system of managing his land was not an 
                exceptional case, but the general condition of things in Russia; 
                that the evolving of some relation of the laborers to the soil 
                which they would work, as with the peasant he had met halfway 
                to the Sviiazhskys', was not a dream, but a problem which must 
                be solved. And it seemed to him that the problem could be solved, 
                and that he ought to try to solve it. </p>
              <p>After saying good night to the ladies, and promising to stay 
                the whole of the next day, so as to make an expedition on horseback 
                with them to see an interesting gap in the crown forest, Levin 
                went, before going to bed, into his host's study to get the books 
                on the labor question that Sviiazhsky had offered him. Sviiazhsky's 
                study was a huge room, by bookcases and with two tables in it 
                - one a massive writing table, standing in the middle of the room, 
                and the other a round table, covered with recent numbers of reviews 
                and journals in different languages, ranged like the rays of a 
                star round a lamp. On the writing table was a stand of drawers 
                marked with gold labels, and full of papers of various sorts. 
              </p>
              <p> Sviiazhsky took out the books, and sat down in a rocking chair. 
              </p>
              <p> `What are you looking at there?' he said to Levin, who was standing 
                at the round table looking through the reviews. `Oh, yes, there's 
                a very interesting article here,' said Sviiazhsky, pointing to 
                the review Levin was holding in his hand. `It appears,' he went 
                on, with eager interest, `that Friedrich was not, after all, the 
                person chiefly responsible for the partition of Poland. It is 
                proved...' </p>
              <p> And, with his characteristic clearness, he summed up those new, 
                very important, and interesting revelations. Although Levin was 
                engrossed at the moment by his ideas about the problem of the 
                land, he wondered, as he heard Sviiazhsky: `What is there inside 
                of him? And why, why is he interested in the partition of Poland?' 
                When Sviiazhsky had finished, Levin could not help asking: `Well, 
                and what then?' But there was nothing to follow. It was simply 
                interesting that such and such had been `proved.' But Sviiazhsky 
                did not explain, and saw no need of explaining, why it was interesting 
                to him. </p>
              <p> `Yes, but I was very much interested by your irritable neighbor,' 
                said Levin, sighing. `He's a clever fellow, and said a lot that 
                was true.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, get along with you! An inveterate supporter of serfdom 
                at heart, like all of them!' said Sviiazhsky. </p>
              <p> `Whose marshal you are.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, only I marshal them in the other direction,' said Sviiazhsky, 
                laughing. </p>
              <p> `I'll tell you what interests me very much,' said Levin. `He's 
                right that our system, that is to say, of rational farming, doesn't 
                answer; that the only thing that answers is the moneylender system, 
                like that meek-looking gentleman's, or else the very simplest. 
                Whose fault is it?' </p>
              <p> `Our own, of course. Besides, it's not true that it doesn't 
                answer. It answers with Vassilchikov.' </p>
              <p> `A factory...' </p>
              <p> `But I really don't know what it is you are surprised at. The 
                people are at such a low stage of material and moral development, 
                that obviously they're bound to oppose everything that's necessary 
                to them. In Europe, a rational system answers because the people 
                are educated; it follows that we must educate the people - that's 
                all.' </p>
              <p> `But how are we to educate the people?' </p>
              <p> `To educate the people three things are needed: schools, and 
                schools, and schools.' </p>
              <p> `But you said yourself the people are at such a low stage of 
                material development: what help are schools for that?' </p>
              <p> `Do you know, you remind me of the story of the advice given 
                to the sick man. - You should try purgative medicine. Taken it: 
                worse. Try leeches. Tried them: worse. Well, then, there's nothing 
                left but to pray to God. Tried it: worse. That's just how it is 
                with us. I say political economy; you say - worse. I say socialism 
                - worse. Education - worse.' </p>
              <p> `But how do schools help matters?' </p>
              <p> `They give the peasant fresh wants.' </p>
              <p> `Well, that's a thing I've never understood,' Levin replied 
                with heat. `In what way are schools going to help the people to 
                improve their material position? You say schools, education, will 
                give them fresh wants. So much the worse, since they won't be 
                capable of satisfying them. And in what way a knowledge of addition 
                and subtraction and the catechism is going to improve their material 
                condition, I never could make out. The day before yesterday I 
                met a peasant woman in the evening with a little baby, and asked 
                her where she was going. She said she was going to the wisewoman; 
                her boy had screaming fits, so she was taking him to be doctored. 
                I asked, ``Why, how does the wisewoman cure screaming fits?' ``She 
                puts the child on the hen roost and repeats some charm....'' </p>
              <p> `Well, you're saying it yourself! What's wanted to prevent her 
                taking her child to the hen roost to cure it of screaming fits 
                is just...' Sviiazhsky said, smiling good-humoredly. </p>
              <p> `Oh, no!' said Levin with annoyance; `that method of doctoring 
                I merely meant as a simile for doctoring the people with schools. 
                The people are poor and ignorant - that we see as surely as the 
                peasant woman sees the baby has fits because it screams. But in 
                what way this trouble of poverty and ignorance is to be cured 
                by schools is as incomprehensible as how the hen roost affects 
                the screaming. What has to be cured is what makes him poor.' </p>
              <p> `Well, in that, at least, you're in agreement with Spencer, 
                whom you dislike so much. He says, too, that education may be 
                the consequence of greater prosperity and comfort, of more frequent 
                washing, as he says, but not of being able to read and write....' 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, then, I'm very glad - or the contrary, very sorry - that 
                I'm in agreement with Spencer; only I've known it a long while. 
                Schools can do no good; what will do good is an economic organization 
                in which the people will become richer, will have more leisure 
                - and then there will be schools.' </p>
              <p> `Still, all over Europe now schools are obligatory.' </p>
              <p> `And how far do you agree with Spencer yourself about it?' asked 
                Levin. </p>
              <p> But there was a gleam of alarm in Sviiazhsky's eyes, and he 
                said smiling: </p>
              <p> `No; that screaming story is positively capital! Did you really 
                hear it yourself?' </p>
              <p> Levin saw that he was not to discover the connection between 
                this man's life and his thoughts. Obviously he did not care in 
                the least what his reasoning led him to; all he wanted was the 
                process of reasoning. And he did not like it when the process 
                of reasoning brought him into a blind alley. That was the only 
                thing he disliked, and avoided by changing the conversation to 
                something agreeable and amusing. </p>
              <p> All the impressions of the day, beginning with the impression 
                made by the old peasant, which served, as it were, as the thorough 
                bass of all the conceptions and ideas of the day, threw Levin 
                into violent excitement. This dear good Sviiazhsky, keeping a 
                stock of ideas simply for public purposes, and obviously having 
                some other principles hidden from Levin, while with the crowd, 
                whose name is legion, he guided public opinion by ideas he did 
                not share; that irascible country gentleman, perfectly correct 
                in the conclusions that he had been worried into by life, but 
                wrong in his exasperation against a whole class, and that the 
                best class in Russia; his own dissatisfaction with the work he 
                had been doing, and the vague hope of finding a remedy for all 
                this - all was blended in a sense of inward turmoil, and the anticipation 
                of some solution near at hand. </p>
              <p> Left alone in the room assigned him, lying on a spring mattress, 
                that yielded unexpectedly at every movement of his arm or his 
                leg, Levin did not fall asleep for a long while. Not one conversation 
                with Sviiazhsky, though he had said a great deal that was clever, 
                had interested Levin; but the conclusions of the irascible landowner 
                required consideration. Levin could not help recalling every word 
                he had said, and in imagination amending his own replies. </p>
              <p> `Yes, I ought to have said to him: You say that our husbandry 
                does not answer because the peasant hates improvements, and that 
                they must be forced on him by authority. If no system of husbandry 
                answered at all without these improvements, you would be quite 
                right. But the only system that does answer is when the laborer 
                is working in accordance with his habits, just as on the old peasant's 
                land halfway here. Your and our general dissatisfaction with the 
                system shows that either we are to blame or the laborers. We have 
                gone our way - the European way - a long while, without asking 
                ourselves about the qualities of our labor force. Let us try to 
                look upon the labor force not as an abstract force but as the 
                Russian mouzhik with his instincts, and let us arrange our system 
                of agriculture in accordance with that. Imagine, I ought to have 
                said to him, that you have the same system as the old peasant 
                has, that you have found means of making your laborers take an 
                interest in the success of the work, and have found the happy 
                mean in the way of improvements which they will admit, and you 
                will, without exhausting the soil, get twice or three times the 
                yield you got before. Divide it in halves, give half as the share 
                of labor, the surplus left you will be greater, and labor's share 
                will be greater too. And to do this one must lower the standard 
                of husbandry and interest the laborers in its success. How to 
                do this? - that's a matter of detail; but undoubtedly it can be 
                done.' </p>
              <p> This idea threw Levin into a great excitement. He did not sleep 
                half the night, thinking over in detail the putting of his idea 
                into practice. He had not intended to go away next day, but he 
                now determined to go home early in the morning. Besides, the sister-in-law 
                with her low-necked bodice aroused in him a feeling akin to shame 
                and remorse for some utterly base action. Most important of all 
                - he must get back without delay: he would have to make haste 
                to put his new project to the peasants before the sowing of the 
                winter wheat, so that the sowing might be undertaken on a new 
                basis. He had made up his mind to revolutionize his whole system.

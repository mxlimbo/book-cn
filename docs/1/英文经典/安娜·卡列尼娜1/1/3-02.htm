              <p><br>
                Early in June Agathya Mikhailovna, the old nurse and housekeeper, 
                in carrying to the cellar a jar of mushrooms she had just pickled, 
                happened to slip, fall and sprain her wrist. The district doctor, 
                a talkative young medico who had just finished his studies, came 
                to see her. He examined the wrist, said it was not luxated, bandaged 
                it, and being asked to dinner evidently was delighted at a chance 
                of talking to the celebrated Sergei Ivanovich Koznishev, and to 
                show his advanced views of things told him all the scandal of 
                the district, complaining of the poor state into which the Zemstvo 
                affairs had fallen. Sergei Ivanovich listened attentively, asked 
                him questions, and, roused by a new listener, he talked fluently, 
                uttered a few keen and weighty observations, respectfully appreciated 
                by the young doctor, and was soon in that animated frame of mind 
                his brother knew so well, which always, with him, followed a brilliant 
                and animated conversation. After the departure of the doctor, 
                he wanted to go with a fishing rod to the river. Sergei Ivanovich 
                was fond of angling, and was, it seemed, proud of being able to 
                care for such a stupid occupation. </p>
              <p>Konstantin Levin, whose presence was needed in the plowland and 
                the meadows, had come to take his brother in the cabriolet. </p>
              <p> It was that time of the year, the turning point of summer, when 
                the crops of the present year are a certainty, when one begins 
                to think of the sowing for next year, and the mowing is at hand; 
                when the rye is all in ear, though its ears are still light, not 
                yet full, and it waves in gray-green billows in the wind; when 
                the green oats, with tufts of yellow grass scattered here and 
                there among it, droop irregularly over the late-sown fields; when 
                the early buckwheat is already out and hiding the ground; when 
                the fallow lands, trodden hard as stone by the cattle, are half-plowed 
                over, with paths left untouched by the plow; when the odor from 
                the dry manure heaps carted into the fields mingles at sunset 
                with the smell of meadowsweet, and on the low-lying lands the 
                preserved meadows are a thick sea of grass waiting for the mowing, 
                with blackened heaps of sorrel stalks among it. </p>
              <p> It was the time when there comes a brief pause in the toil of 
                the fields before the beginning of the labors of harvest - every 
                year recurring, every year claiming all the peasant's thews. The 
                crop was a splendid one, and bright, hot summer days had set in 
                with short, dewy nights. </p>
              <p> The brothers had to drive through the woods to reach the meadows. 
                Sergei Ivanovich was all the while admiring the beauty of the 
                woods, which were a tangled mass of leaves, pointing out to his 
                brother now an old lime tree on the point of flowering, dark on 
                the shady side, and brightly spotted with yellow stipules, now 
                the young shoots of this year's saplings brilliant with emerald. 
                Konstantin Levin did not like talking and hearing about the beauty 
                of nature. Words for him took away the beauty of what he saw. 
                He assented to what his brother said, but could not help thinking 
                of other things. When they came out of the woods, all his attention 
                was engrossed by the view of the fallow land on the upland, in 
                parts yellow with grass, in parts trampled and checkered with 
                furrows, in parts dotted with ridges of manure, and in parts even 
                plowed. A string of telegas was moving across it. Levin counted 
                the telegas, and was pleased that all that were wanted had been 
                brought, and at the sight of the meadows his thoughts passed to 
                the mowing. He always felt something peculiar moving him to the 
                quick at haymaking. On reaching the meadow Levin stopped the horse. 
              </p>
              <p> The morning dew was still lying on the thick undergrowth of 
                the grass, and, that he might not get his feet wet, Sergei Ivanovich 
                asked his brother to drive him in the cabriolet up to the willow 
                tree from which the perch were caught. Sorry as Konstantin Levin 
                was to crush down his mowing grass, he drove him into the meadow. 
                The high grass softly turned about the wheels and the horse's 
                legs, leaving its seeds clinging to the wet axles and spokes of 
                the wheels. </p>
              <p> His brother seated himself under a bush, arranging his tackle, 
                while Levin led the horse away, tied him up and walked into the 
                vast gray-green sea of grass unstirred by the wind. The silky 
                grass with its ripe seeds came almost to his waist in the riverside 
                spots. </p>
              <p> Crossing the meadow, Konstantin Levin came out on the road, 
                and met an old man with a swollen eye, carrying a swarming basket 
                with bees. </p>
              <p> `What? Taken a stray swarm, Fomich?' he asked. </p>
              <p> `No, indeed, Konstantin Mitrich! All we can do to keep our own! 
                This is the second new swarm that has flown away.... Luckily the 
                lads caught them. They were plowing your field. They unyoked the 
                horses and galloped after them.' </p>
              <p> `Well, what do you say, Fomich - start mowing or wait a bit?' 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, now! Our way's to wait till St. Peter's Day. But you 
                always mow sooner. Well, to be sure, please God, the hay's good. 
                There'll be plenty for the beasts.' </p>
              <p> `What do you think about the weather?' </p>
              <p> `That's in God's hands. Maybe even the weather will favor us.' 
              </p>
              <p> Levin walked up to his brother. </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich had caught nothing, but he was not bored, and 
                seemed in the most cheerful frame of mind. Levin saw that, stimulated 
                by his conversation with the doctor, he wanted to talk. Levin, 
                on the other hand, would have liked to get home as soon as possible, 
                to give orders about getting together the mowers for next day, 
                and to set at rest his doubts about the mowing, which greatly 
                absorbed him. </p>
              <p> `Well, let's be going,' he said. </p>
              <p> `Why be in such a hurry? Let's stay a little. But how wet you 
                are! Even though one catches nothing, it's fine. That's the best 
                thing about every part of sport, that one has to do with nature. 
                How exquisite this steely water is!' said Sergei Ivanovich. `These 
                riverside banks always remind me of the riddle - do you know it? 
                ``The grass says to the river: we quiver and we quiver.'' </p>
              <p> `I don't know the riddle,' answered Levin cheerlessly. </p>

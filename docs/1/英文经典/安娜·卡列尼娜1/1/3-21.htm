                `I've come to fetch you. Your lessive lasted a good time today,' 
                said Petritsky. `Well, is it over?' </p>
              <p>`It's over,' answered Vronsky, smiling with his eyes only, and 
                twirling the tips of his mustaches as circumspectly as though 
                after the perfect order into which his affairs had been brought 
                any overbold or rapid movement might disturb it. </p>
              <p> `You're always just as if you'd come out of a bath after it,' 
                said Petritsky. `I've come from Gritzka' (that was what they called 
                the colonel); - `you're expected there.' </p>
              <p> Vronsky, without answering, looked at his comrade, thinking 
                of something else. </p>
              <p> `Yes; is that music at his place?' he said, listening to the 
                familiar bass sounds of trumpets, of polkas and waltzes, floating 
                across to him. `What's the fete?' </p>
              <p> `Serpukhovskoy's come.' </p>
              <p> `Aha!' said Vronsky. `Why, I didn't know.' </p>
              <p> The smile in his eyes gleamed more brightly than ever. </p>
              <p> Having once made up his mind that he was happy in his love, 
                that he sacrificed his ambition to it - at any rate, having taken 
                up this role - Vronsky was incapable of feeling either envious 
                of Serpukhovskoy, or vexed at him for not having come to him first 
                upon coming to the regiment. Serpukhovskoy was a good friend, 
                and he was delighted he had come. </p>
              <p> `Ah, I'm very glad!' </p>
              <p> The colonel, Demin, had taken a large country house. The whole 
                party was on the wide lower balcony. In the courtyard the first 
                objects that met Vronsky's eyes were a band of singers in short 
                white linen jackets, standing near a barrel of vodka, and the 
                robust, good-humored figure of the colonel surrounded by officers. 
                He had gone out as far as the first step of the balcony and was 
                loudly shouting to drown out the band playing an Offenbach quadrille, 
                waving his arms and giving some orders to a few soldiers standing 
                on one side. A group of soldiers, a quartermaster, and several 
                subalterns came up to the balcony with Vronsky. The colonel returned 
                to the table, went out again on the steps with a tumbler in his 
                hand, and proposed the toast, `To the health of our former comrade, 
                the gallant general, Prince Serpukhovskoy. Hurrah!' </p>
              <p> The colonel was followed by Serpukhovskoy, who came out on the 
                steps smiling, with a glass in his hand. </p>
              <p> `You always get younger, Bondarenko,' he said to the rosy-cheeked, 
                smart-looking sergeant standing just before him, still youngish-looking 
                though doing his second term of service. </p>
              <p> It was three years since Vronsky had seen Serpukhovskoy. He 
                looked more robust, had let his whiskers grow, but was still the 
                same graceful creature, whose face and figure were even more striking 
                from their fineness and nobility than their beauty. The only change 
                Vronsky detected in him was that subdued, continual beaming which 
                settles on the faces of men who are successful and are sure of 
                the recognition of their success by everyone. Vronsky knew that 
                radiant air, and immediately observed it in Serpukhovskoy. </p>
              <p> As Serpukhovskoy came down the steps he saw Vronsky. A smile 
                of pleasure lighted up his face. He tossed his head upward and 
                waved the glass in his hand, greeting Vronsky, and showing him 
                by the gesture that he could not come to him before kissing the 
                sergeant who stood craning forward his lips ready to be kissed. 
              </p>
              <p> `Here he is!' shouted the colonel. `Iashvin told me you were 
                in one of your gloomy tempers.' </p>
              <p> Serpukhovskoy kissed the moist, fresh lips of the brave sergeant, 
                and, wiping his mouth with his handkerchief, walked up to Vronsky. 
              </p>
              <p> `How glad I am!' he said, squeezing his hand and drawing him 
                to one side. </p>
              <p> `You look after him,' the colonel shouted to Iashvin, pointing 
                to Vronsky; and he went down below to the soldiers. </p>
              <p> `Why weren't you at the races yesterday? I expected to see you 
                there,' said Vronsky, scrutinizing Serpukhovskoy. </p>
              <p> `I did go, but late. I beg your pardon,' he added, and turned 
                to the adjutant: `Please have this distributed from me, each man 
                as much as it comes to.' </p>
              <p> And he hurriedly took three notes for a hundred roubles each 
                from his pocketbook, and blushed. </p>
              <p> `Vronsky! Have a bite or a drink?' asked Iashvin. `Hi, something 
                for the Count to eat! There - drink that.' </p>
              <p> The spree at the colonel's lasted a long while. </p>
              <p> There was a great deal of drinking. They swung Serpukhovskoy 
                and tossed him in the air. Then they did the same to the colonel. 
                Then, to the accompaniment of the band, the colonel himself danced 
                with Petritsky. Then the colonel, who began to show signs of weakening, 
                sat down on a bench in the courtyard and began demonstrating to 
                Iashvin the superiority of Russia over Prussia, especially in 
                cavalry attack, and there was a lull in the revelry for a moment. 
                Serpukhovskoy went into the house to the bathroom to wash his 
                hands and found Vronsky there - Vronsky was sousing his head with 
                water. He had taken off his coat and put his red hairy neck under 
                the tap, and was rubbing it and his head with his hands. When 
                he had finished, Vronsky sat down by Serpukhovskoy. They both 
                sat down in the bathroom on a lounge, and a conversation began 
                which was very interesting to both of them. </p>
              <p> `I've always been hearing about you through my wife,' said Serpukhovskoy. 
                `I'm glad you've been seeing her pretty often.' </p>
              <p> `She's friendly with Varia, and they're the only women in Peterburg 
                I care about seeing,' answered Vronsky, smiling. He smiled because 
                he foresaw the topic the conversation would turn to, and he was 
                glad of it. </p>
              <p> `The only ones?' Serpukhovskoy queried, smiling. </p>
              <p> `Yes; and I heard news of you, but not only through your wife,' 
                said Vronsky, checking Serpukhovskoy's hint by assuming a stern 
                expression. `I was greatly delighted to hear of your success, 
                but not a bit surprised. I expected even more.' </p>
              <p> Serpukhovskoy smiled. Such an opinion of him was obviously agreeable 
                to him, and he did not think it necessary to conceal it. </p>
              <p> `Well, I, on the contrary, expected less - I'll own up frankly. 
                But I'm glad, very glad. I'm ambitious - that's my weakness, and 
                I confess to it.' </p>
              <p> `Perhaps you wouldn't confess to it if you hadn't been successful,' 
                said Vronsky. </p>
              <p> `I don't suppose so,' said Serpukhovskoy, smiling again. `I 
                won't say life wouldn't be worth living without it, but it would 
                be dull. Of course I may be mistaken, but I fancy I have a certain 
                capacity for the line I've chosen, and that if there is to be 
                power of any sort in my hands, it will be better than in the hands 
                of a good many people I know,' said Serpukhovskoy, with beaming 
                consciousness of success; `and so the nearer I get to it, the 
                better pleased I am.' </p>
              <p> `Perhaps that is true for you, but not for everyone. I used 
                to think so too, but now I see and think life worth living not 
                only for that.' </p>
              <p> `There it comes! there it comes!' said Serpukhovskoy laughing. 
                `Ever since I heard about you, about your refusal, I began... 
                Of course, I approved of what you did. But there are ways of doing 
                everything. And I think your action was good in itself, but you 
                didn't do it in quite the way you should have done.' </p>
              <p> `What's done can't be undone, and you know I never go back on 
                what I've done. And, besides, I'm very well off.' </p>
              <p> `Very well off - for the time. But you're not satisfied with 
                that. I wouldn't say this to your brother. He's a charming child, 
                like our host here. There he goes!' he added, listening to the 
                roar of a `hurrah!' - `and he's happy; that does not satisfy you.' 
              </p>
              <p> `I didn't say it did.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, but that's not the only thing. Such men as you are wanted.' 
              </p>
              <p> `By whom?' </p>
              <p> `By whom? By society, by Russia. Russia needs men, she needs 
                a party, or else everything goes and will go to the dogs.' </p>
              <p> `How do you mean? Bertenev's party against the Russian communists?' 
              </p>
              <p> `No,' said Serpukhovskoy, frowning with vexation at being suspected 
                of such an absurdity. `Tout ?a est une blague. That has always 
                been, and always will be. There are no communists. But intriguing 
                people have to invent a noxious, dangerous party. It's an old 
                trick. No, what's wanted is a powerful party of independent men, 
                like you and me.' </p>
              <p> `But why so?' Vronsky mentioned a few men who were in power. 
                `Why aren't they independent men?' </p>
              <p> `Simply because they have not, or have not had from birth, an 
                independent fortune, they've not had a name, they weren't born 
                close to the sun as we were. They can be bought either by money 
                or by favor. And they have to find a support for themselves in 
                inventing a trend. And they bring forward some notion, some trend 
                that they don't believe in, that does harm; and the whole policy 
                is really only a means to a house at the expense of the crown 
                and so much income. Cela n'est pas plus fin que ?a, when you get 
                a peep at their cards. I may be inferior to them, more stupid 
                perhaps, though I don't see why I should be inferior to them. 
                But you and I have one important, certain advantage over them, 
                in being more difficult to buy. And such men are more needed than 
                ever.' </p>
              <p> Vronsky listened attentively, but he was not so much interested 
                by the meaning of the words as by the attitude of Serpukhovskoy, 
                who was already contemplating a struggle with the existing powers, 
                and already had his likes and dislikes in that world, while his 
                own interest in his service did not go beyond the interests of 
                his squadron. Vronsky felt, too, how powerful Serpukhovskoy might 
                become through his unmistakable faculty for thinking things out 
                and for taking things in, through his intelligence and gift of 
                eloquence, so rarely met with in the world in which he moved. 
                And, ashamed as he was of the feeling, he felt envious. </p>
              <p> `Still I haven't the one thing of paramount importance for that,' 
                he answered; `I haven't the desire for power. I had it once, but 
                it's gone.' </p>
              <p> `Excuse me, that's not true,' said Serpukhovskoy smiling. </p>
              <p> `Yes, it's true, it's true - now to be truthful!' Vronsky added. 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, it's true now, that's another thing; but that now won't 
                last forever.' </p>
              <p> `Perhaps,' answered Vronsky. </p>
              <p> `You say perhaps,' Serpukhovskoy went on, as though guessing 
                his thoughts, `but I say for certain. And that's what I wanted 
                to see you for. Your action was just what it should have been. 
                I see that, but you ought not to persevere in it. I only ask you 
                to give me carte blanche. I'm not going to offer you my protection.... 
                Though, indeed, why shouldn't I protect you? - you've protected 
                me often enough! I should hope our friendship rises above all 
                that sort of thing. Yes,' he said, smiling to him as tenderly 
                as a woman, `give me carte blanche, retire from the regiment, 
                and I'll get you in imperceptibly.' </p>
              <p> `But you must understand that I want nothing,' said Vronsky, 
                `except to leave things just as they were.' </p>
              <p> Serpukhovskoy got up and stood facing him. </p>
              <p> `You said, leave things just as they were. I understand what 
                that means. But listen: we're the same age, you've known a greater 
                number of women perhaps than I have.' Serpukhovskoy's smile and 
                gestures told Vronsky that he mustn't be afraid, that he would 
                be tender and careful in touching the sore place. `But I'm married, 
                and believe me, in getting to know one's wife thoroughly, if one 
                loves her, as someone has said, one gets to know all women better 
                than if one knew thousands of them.' </p>
              <p> `We're coming directly!' Vronsky shouted to an officer, who 
                looked into the room and called them to the colonel. </p>
              <p> Vronsky was longing now to hear Serpukhovskoy to the end, and 
                know what he would say to him. </p>
              <p> `And here's my opinion for you. Women are the chief stumbling 
                block in a man's career. It's hard to love a woman and do anything. 
                There's only one way of having love conveniently without its being 
                a hindrance - that's marriage. Now, how am I to tell you what 
                I mean?' said Serpukhovskoy, who liked similes. `Wait, wait a 
                minute! Yes, just as you can only carry a fardeau yet do something 
                with your hands when the fardeau is tied on your back - and that's 
                marriage. And that's what I felt when I was married. My hands 
                were suddenly set free. But if you drag that fardeau about with 
                you without marriage, your hands will always be so full that you 
                can do nothing. Look at Mazankov, at Krupov. They've ruined their 
                careers for the sake of women.' </p>
              <p> `What women!' said Vronsky, recalling the Frenchwoman and the 
                actress with whom the two men he had mentioned were connected. 
              </p>
              <p> `The firmer the woman's footing in society, the worse it is. 
                That's much the same as not merely carrying the fardeau in your 
                arms, but tearing it away from someone else.' </p>
              <p> `You have never loved,' Vronsky said softly, looking straight 
                before him and thinking of Anna. </p>
              <p> `Perhaps. But you remember what I've said to you. And another 
                thing - women are all more materialistic than men. We make something 
                immense out of love, but they are always terre-èa-terre.' </p>
              <p> `Directly, directly!' he cried to a footman who came in. But 
                the footman had not come to call them again, as he supposed. The 
                footman brought Vronsky a note. </p>
              <p> `A man brought it from Princess Tverskaia.' </p>
              <p> Vronsky opened the letter, and flushed crimson. </p>
              <p> `My head's begun to ache; I'm going home,' he said to Serpukhovskoy. 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, good-by then. You give me carte blanche!' </p>
              <p> `We'll talk about it later on; I'll look you up in Peterburg.' 
              </p>

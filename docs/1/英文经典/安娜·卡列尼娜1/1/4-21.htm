                Before Betsy had time to walk out of the drawing room, she was 
                met in the doorway by Stepan Arkadyevich, who had just come from 
                Ielisseev's, where a consignment of fresh oysters had been received. 
                <br>
                `Ah! Princess! What a delightful meeting!' he began. `I've been 
                to see you.' </p>
              <p> `A meeting for one minute, for I'm going,' said Betsy, smiling 
                and putting on her glove. </p>
              <p> `Don't put on your glove yet, Princess; let me kiss your hand. 
                There's nothing I'm so thankful to the revival of the old fashions 
                for as kissing the hand.' He kissed Betsy's hand. `When shall 
                we see each other?' </p>
              <p> `You don't deserve it,' answered Betsy, smiling. </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes, I deserve a great deal, for I've become a most serious 
                person. I not only manage my own domestic affairs, but other people's 
                too,' he said, with a significant expression. </p>
              <p> `Oh, I'm so glad!' answered Betsy, at once understanding that 
                he was speaking of Anna. And, going back into the drawing room, 
                they stood in a corner. `He's killing her,' said Betsy in a whisper 
                full of meaning. `It's impossible, impossible...' </p>
              <p> `I'm so glad you think so,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, shaking 
                his head with a serious and sympathetically distressed expression, 
                `that's what I've come to Peterburg for.' </p>
              <p> `The whole town's talking of it,' she said. `It's an impossible 
                situation. She pines and pines away. He doesn't understand that 
                she's one of those women who can't trifle with their feelings. 
                One of two things: either let him take her away, act with energy, 
                or give her a divorce. This is stifling her.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes... just so...' Oblonsky said, sighing. </p>
              <p> `That's what I've come for. At least not solely for that... 
                I've been made a Kammerherr; of course, one has to give thanks. 
                But the chief thing was having to settle this.' </p>
              <p> `Well, God help you!' said Betsy. </p>
              <p> After accompanying Betsy to the outside hall, once more kissing 
                her hand above the glove, at the point where the pulse beats, 
                and murmuring to her such unseemly nonsense that she did not know 
                whether to laugh or to be angry, Stepan Arkadyevich went to his 
                sister. He found her in tears. </p>
              <p> Although he happened to be bubbling over with good spirits, 
                Stepan Arkadyevich immediately and quite naturally fell into the 
                sympathetic, poetically emotional tone which harmonized with her 
                mood. He asked her how she was, and how she had spent the morning. 
              </p>
              <p> `Very, very miserably. Today, and this morning, and all past 
                days, and all the days to come,' she said. </p>
              <p> `I think you're giving way to pessimism. You must rouse yourself, 
                you must look life in the face. I know it's hard, but...' </p>
              <p> `I have heard it said that women love men even for their vices,' 
                Anna began suddenly, `but I hate him for his virtues. I can't 
                live with him. Do you understand? The sight of him has a physical 
                effect in me - I am beside myself from it. I can't, I can't live 
                with him. What am I to do? I have been unhappy, and used to think 
                one couldn't be unhappier, but the awful state of things I am 
                going through now I could never have conceived. Would you believe 
                it, that, knowing he's a good man, a splendid man, that I'm not 
                worth his little finger, I still hate him. I hate him for his 
                generosity. And there's nothing left for me but...' </p>
              <p> She would have said `death,' but Stepan Arkadyevich would not 
                let her finish. </p>
              <p> `You are ill and overwrought,' he said; `believe me, you're 
                exaggerating dreadfully. There's nothing so terrible in it.' </p>
              <p> And Stepan Arkadyevich smiled. No one else in Stepan Arkadyevich's 
                place, having to do with such despair, would have ventured to 
                smile (the smile would have seemed brutal); but in his smile there 
                was so much of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his 
                smile did not wound, but softened and soothed. His gentle, soothing 
                words and smiles were as soothing and softening as almond oil. 
                And Anna soon felt this. </p>
              <p> `No, Stiva,' she said, `I'm lost, lost! Worse than lost! I can't 
                say yet that all is over; on the contrary, I feel that it's not 
                over. I'm an overstrained cord that must snap. But it's not ended 
                yet... And it will have a fearful end.' </p>
              <p> `No matter, we must let the cord be loosened, little by little. 
                There's no position from which there is no way of escape.' </p>
              <p> `I have thought, and thought. Only one...' </p>
              <p> Again he knew from her terrified eyes that this one way of escape 
                in her thought was death, and he would not let her say it. </p>
              <p> `Not at all,' he said. `Listen to me. You can't see your own 
                position as I can. Let me tell you candidly my opinion.' Again 
                he smiled discreetly his almond-oil smile. `I'll begin from the 
                beginning. You married a man twenty years older than yourself. 
                You married him without love and not knowing what love was. It 
                was a mistake, let's admit.' </p>
              <p> `A fearful mistake!' said Anna. </p>
              <p> `But, I repeat, it's an accomplished fact. Then you had, let 
                us say, the misfortune to love a man not your husband. That was 
                a misfortune; but that, too, is an accomplished fact. And your 
                husband knew it and forgave it.' He stopped at each sentence, 
                waiting for her to object, but she made no answer. `That's that. 
                Now the question is: Can you go on living with your husband? Do 
                you wish it? Does he wish it?' </p>
              <p> `I know nothing, nothing.' </p>
              <p> `But you said yourself that you can't endure him.' </p>
              <p> `No, I didn't say so. I deny it. I don't know anything, I don't 
                understand anything.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, but let...' </p>
              <p> `You can't understand. I feel I'm lying head downward in a sort 
                of pit, but I ought not to save myself. And I can't...' </p>
              <p> `Never mind, we'll slip something under you and pull you out. 
                I understand you: I understand that you can't take it on yourself 
                to express your wishes, your feelings.' </p>
              <p> `There's nothing, nothing I wish... except for it to be all 
                over.' </p>
              <p> `But he sees this and knows it. And do you suppose it weighs 
                on him any less than on you? You're wretched, he's wretched, and 
                what good can come of it? While divorce would solve the whole 
                difficulty.' With some effort Stepan Arkadyevich brought out his 
                central idea, and looked significantly at her. </p>
              <p> She said nothing, and shook her cropped head in dissent. But 
                from the look in her face, that suddenly brightened into its former 
                beauty, he saw that if she did not desire this, it was simply 
                because it seemed to her an unattainable happiness. </p>
              <p> `I'm awfully sorry for you both! And how happy I should be if 
                I could arrange things!' said Stepan Arkadyevich, smiling more 
                boldly. `Don't speak, don't say a word! God grant only that I 
                may speak as I feel. I'm going to him.' </p>
              <p> Anna looked at him with dreamy, shining eyes, and said nothing. 
              </p>

              <p><br>
                The Prince communicated his good humor to his own family and his 
                friends, and even to the German landlord in whose rooms the Shcherbatskys 
                were staying. </p>
              <p>On coming back with Kitty from the springs, the Prince, who had 
                asked the colonel, and Marya Eugenyevna, and Varenka all to come 
                and have coffee with them, gave orders for a table and chairs 
                to be taken into the tiny garden under the chestnut tree, and 
                lunch to be laid there. The landlord and the servants, too, grew 
                brisker under the influence of his good spirits. They knew his 
                openhandedness; and half an hour later the invalid doctor from 
                Hamburg, who lived on the top floor, looked enviously out of his 
                window at the merry party of healthy Russians assembled under 
                the chestnut tree. In the trembling circles of shadow cast by 
                the leaves, at a table covered with a white cloth, and set with 
                coffeepot, bread, butter, cheese, and cold game, sat the Princess 
                in a high cap with lilac ribbons, distributing cups and sandwiches. 
                At the other end sat the Prince, eating heartily, and talking 
                loudly and merrily. The Prince had spread out near him his purchases 
                - carved boxes, and knickknacks, and paper knives of all sorts, 
                of which he had bought a heap at every watering place, and bestowed 
                them upon everyone, including Lieschen, the servant girl, and 
                the landlord, with whom he jested in his comically bad German, 
                assuring him that it was not the water had cured Kitty, but his 
                splendid cookery - especially his plum soup. The Princess laughed 
                at her husband for his Russian ways, but she was more lively and 
                good-humored than she had been all the while she had been at the 
                waters. The colonel smiled, as he always did, at the Prince's 
                jokes, but as far as regards Europe, of which he believed himself 
                to be making a careful study, he took the Princess's side. The 
                goodhearted Marya Eugenyevna simply roared with laughter at everything 
                absurd the Prince said, and his jokes made Varenka helpless with 
                feeble but infectious laughter, which was something Kitty had 
                never seen before. </p>
              <p> Kitty was glad of all this, but she could not be lighthearted. 
                She could not solve the problem her father had unconsciously set 
                her by his good-humored view of her friends, and of the life that 
                had so attracted her. To this doubt there was joined the change 
                in her relations with the Petrovs, which had been so conspicuously 
                and unpleasantly marked that morning. Everyone was good-humored, 
                but Kitty could not feel good-humored, and this increased her 
                distress. She felt a feeling such as she had known in childhood, 
                when she had been shut in her room as a punishment, and had heard 
                her sisters' merry laughter outside. </p>
              <p> `Well, but what did you buy this mass of things for? said the 
                Princess, smiling, and handing her husband a cup of coffee. </p>
              <p> `One goes for a walk, one looks in a shop, and they ask you 
                to buy. ``Erlaucht, Excellenz, Durchlaucht?'' Directly they say 
                ``Durchlaucht,'' I can't hold out - and ten thalers are gone.' 
              </p>
              <p> `It's simply from boredom,' said the Princess. </p>
              <p> `Of course it is. Such boredom, my dear, that one doesn't know 
                what to do with oneself.' </p>
              <p> `How can you be bored, Prince? There's so much that's interesting 
                now in Germany,' said Marya Eugenyevna. </p>
              <p> `But I know everything that's interesting: the plum soup I know 
                and the pea sausages I know. I know everything.' </p>
              <p> `No, you may say what you like, Prince - there's the interest 
                of their institutions,' said the colonel. </p>
              <p> `But what is there interesting? They're all as beaming with 
                joy as brass halfpence; they've conquered everybody. And why am 
                I to be pleased at that? I haven't conquered anyone; only I have 
                myself to take off my own boots, and, besides, to expose them 
                before the door; in the morning, get up and dress at once, and 
                go to the coffeeroom to drink bad tea! How different it is at 
                home! You get up in no haste, you get cross, grumble a little 
                and come round again. You've time to think things over, and no 
                hurry.' </p>
              <p> `But time's money, you forget that,' said the colonel. </p>
              <p> `Time, indeed! Why, there are times one would give a month of 
                for half a rouble, and times you wouldn't give half an hour of 
                for any money. Isn't that so, Katenka? What is it? Why are you 
                so depressed?' </p>
              <p> `I'm not depressed.' </p>
              <p> `Where are you off to? Stay a little longer,' he said to Varenka. 
              </p>
              <p> `I must be going home,' said Varenka, getting up, and again 
                she broke out laughing. When she had recovered, she said good-by, 
                and went into the house to get her hat. </p>
              <p> Kitty followed her. Even Varenka struck her as different. She 
                was not inferior, but different from what she had fancied her 
                before. </p>
              <p> `Oh, dear! It's a long while since I've laughed so much!' said 
                Varenka, gathering up her parasol and her handbag. `What a dear 
                your father is!' </p>
              <p> Kitty did not speak. </p>
              <p> `When shall I see you again?' asked Varenka. </p>
              <p> `Maman meant to go and see the Petrovs. Won't you be there?' 
                said Kitty, to try Varenka. </p>
              <p> `Yes,' answered Varenka. `They're getting ready to go away, 
                so I promised to help them pack.' </p>
              <p> `Well, I'll come too, then.' </p>
              <p> `No, why should you?' </p>
              <p> `Why not? Why not? Why not?' said Kitty, opening her eyes wide, 
                and clutching at Varenka's parasol, so as not to let her go. `No, 
                wait a minute - why not?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, nothing; your father has come, and, besides, they will 
                feel awkward at your helping.' </p>
              <p> `No, tell me why you don't want me to be often at the Petrovs? 
                You don't want me to - why not?' </p>
              <p> `I didn't say that,' said Varenka quietly. </p>
              <p> `No, please tell me!' </p>
              <p> `Tell you everything?' asked Varenka. </p>
              <p> `Everything, everything!' Kitty assented. </p>
              <p> `Well, there's really nothing of any consequence; only that 
                Mikhail Alexeievich' (that was the artist's name) `had meant to 
                leave earlier, and now he doesn't want to go away,' said Varenka, 
                smiling. </p>
              <p> `Go on, go on!' Kitty urged impatiently, looking somberly at 
                Varenka. </p>
              <p> `Well, and for some reason Anna Pavlovna told him that he didn't 
                want to go because you are here. Of course, that was nonsense; 
                but there was a dispute over it - over you. You know how irritable 
                these sick people are.' </p>
              <p> Kitty, scowling more than ever, kept silent, and Varenka went 
                on speaking alone, trying to soften or soothe her, and seeing 
                a storm coming - she did not know whether of tears or of words. 
              </p>
              <p> `So you'd better not go... You understand; you won't be offended?...' 
              </p>
              <p> `And it serves me right! And it serves me right!' Kitty cried 
                quickly, snatching the parasol out of Varenka's hand, and avoiding 
                looking at her friend's face. </p>
              <p> Varenka felt inclined to smile, looking at her friend's childish 
                fury, but she was afraid of wounding her. </p>
              <p> `How does it serve you right? I don't understand,' she said. 
              </p>
              <p> `It serves me right, because it was all sham; because it was 
                all done on purpose, and not from the heart. What business had 
                I to interfere with outsiders? And so it's come about that I'm 
                the cause of a quarrel, and that I've done what nobody asked me 
                to do. Because it was all a sham! A sham! A sham!...' </p>
              <p> `A sham? With what object?' said Varenka gently. </p>
              <p> `Oh, it's so idiotic! So hateful! There was no need whatever 
                for me... Nothing but sham!' she said, opening and shutting the 
                parasol. </p>
              <p> `But with what object?' </p>
              <p> `To seem better to people, to myself, to God; to deceive everyone. 
                No! Now I won't descend to that. One could be bad; but anyway 
                not a liar, not a cheat.' </p>
              <p> `But who is a cheat?' said Varenka reproachfully. `You speak 
                as if...' </p>
              <p> But Kitty was in one of her gusts of fury, and she would not 
                let her finish. </p>
              <p> `I don't talk about you - not about you at all. You're perfection. 
                Yes, yes, I know you're all perfection; but what am I to do if 
                I'm bad? This would never have been if I weren't bad. So let me 
                be what I am, but not to be a sham. What have I to do with Anna 
                Pavlovna? Let them go their way, and me go mine. I can't be different.... 
                And yet it's not that, it's not that.' </p>
              <p> `What is it?' asked Varenka in bewilderment. </p>
              <p> `Everything. I can't act except from the heart, and you act 
                from principle. I simply liked you, but you most likely only wanted 
                to save me, to improve me.' </p>
              <p> `You are unjust,' said Varenka. </p>
              <p> `But I'm not speaking of other people, I'm speaking of myself.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Kitty,' they heard her mother's voice, `come here, show papa 
                your necklace.' </p>
              <p> Kitty, with a haughty air, without making peace with her friend, 
                took the necklace in a little box from the table and went to her 
                mother. </p>
              <p> `What's the matter? Why are you so red?' her mother and father 
                said to her with one voice. </p>
              <p> `Nothing,' she answered. `I'll be back directly,' and she ran 
                back. </p>
              <p> `She's still here,' she thought. `What am I to say to her? Oh, 
                dear! What have I done, what have I said? Why was I rude to her? 
                What am I to do? What am I to say to her?' thought Kitty, and 
                she stopped in the doorway. </p>
              <p> Varenka in her hat and with the parasol in her hands was sitting 
                at a table examining the parasol spring which Kitty had broken. 
                She lifted her head. </p>
              <p> `Varenka, forgive me, do forgive me,' whispered Kitty, going 
                up to her. `I don't remember what I said. I...' </p>
              <p> `I really didn't mean to hurt you,' said Varenka, smiling. </p>
              <p> Peace was made. But with her father's coming all the world in 
                which she had been living was transformed for Kitty. She did not 
                give up everything she had learned, but she became aware that 
                she had deceived herself in supposing she could be what she wanted 
                to be. Her eyes were, it seemed, opened; she felt all the difficulty 
                of maintaining herself without hypocrisy and self-conceit on the 
                pinnacle to which she had wished to mount. Moreover, she became 
                aware of all the dreariness of the world of sorrow, of sick and 
                dying people, in which she had been living. The efforts she had 
                made to like it seemed to her intolerable, and she felt a longing 
                to get back quickly into the fresh air, to Russia, to Ergushovo, 
                where, as she knew from letters, her sister Dolly had already 
                gone with her children. </p>
              <p> But her affection for Varenka did not wane. Parting Kitty begged 
                her to come to them in Russia. </p>
              <p> `I'll come when you get married,' said Varenka. </p>
              <p> `I shall never marry.' </p>
              <p> `Well, then, I shall never come.' </p>
              <p> `Well, then, I shall be married simply for that. Mind now, remember 
                your promise,' said Kitty. </p>
              <p> The doctor's prediction was fulfilled. Kitty returned home, 
                to Russia, cured. She was not as gay and thoughtless as before, 
                but she was serene. Her Moscow troubles had become a memory to 
                her. </p>

                When Alexei Alexandrovich reached the racecourse Anna was already 
                sitting in the pavilion beside Betsy, in that pavilion where the 
                highest society had gathered. She caught sight of her husband 
                in the distance. Two men, her husband and her lover, were the 
                two centers of her existence, and, unaided by her external senses, 
                she was aware of their proximity. She was aware of her husband 
                approaching a long way off, and she could not help following him 
                in the surging crowd in the midst of which he was moving. She 
                watched his progress toward the pavilion, saw him now responding 
                condescendingly to an ingratiating bow, now exchanging friendly, 
                nonchalant greetings with his equals, now assiduously trying to 
                catch the eye of some great one of this world, and taking off 
                his big round hat that pressed down the tips of his ears. All 
                these ways of his she knew, and all were hateful to her. `Nothing 
                but ambition, nothing but desire to get on - that's all there 
                is in his soul,' she thought; `as for his lofty ideals, love of 
                culture, religion, they are only so many tools for getting on.' 
              </p>
              <p>From his glances toward the ladies' pavilion (he was staring 
                straight at her, but did not distinguish his wife in the sea of 
                muslin, ribbons, feathers, parasols and flowers) she saw that 
                he was looking for her, but she purposely avoided noticing him. 
              </p>
              <p> `Alexei Alexandrovich!' Princess Betsy called to him; `I'm sure 
                you don't see your wife: here she is.' </p>
              <p> He smiled his chilly smile. </p>
              <p> `There's so much splendor here that one's eyes are dazzled,' 
                he said, and he went into the pavilion. He smiled to his wife 
                as a man should smile on meeting his wife after only just parting 
                from her, and greeted the princess and other acquaintances, giving 
                to each what was due - that is to say, jesting with the ladies 
                and dealing out friendly greetings among the men. Below, near 
                the pavilion, was standing an adjutant general of whom Alexei 
                Alexandrovich had a high opinion, noted for his intelligence and 
                culture. Alexei Alexandrovich entered into conversation with him. 
              </p>
              <p> There was an interval between the races, and so nothing hindered 
                conversation. The adjutant general expressed his disapproval of 
                races. Alexei Alexandrovich replied defending them. Anna heard 
                his high, measured tones, without losing one word, and every word 
                struck her as false, and stabbed her ears with pain. </p>
              <p> When the four-versta steeplechase was beginning, she bent forward 
                and gazed with fixed eyes at Vronsky as he went up to his horse 
                and mounted, and at the same time she heard that loathsome, never-ceasing 
                voice of her husband. She was in an agony of terror for Vronsky, 
                but a still greater agony was the never-ceasing, as it seemed 
                to her, stream of her husband's shrill voice with its familiar 
                intonations. </p>
              <p> `I'm a wicked woman, a lost woman,' she thought; `but I don't 
                like lying, I can't endure falsehood, while as for him [her husband], 
                falsehood is the breath of life to him. He knows all about it, 
                he sees it all; what does he care if he can talk so calmly? If 
                he were to kill me, if he were to kill Vronsky, I might respect 
                him. No, all he wants is falsehood and propriety,' Anna said to 
                herself, not considering exactly what it was she wanted of her 
                husband, and how she would have liked to see him behave. She did 
                not understand either that Alexei Alexandrovich's peculiar loquacity 
                that day, so exasperating to her, was merely the expression of 
                his inward distress and uneasiness. As a child that has been hurt 
                hops about, putting all his muscles into movement to drown the 
                pain, in the same way Alexei Alexandrovich needed mental exercise 
                to drown the thoughts of his wife, that in her presence and in 
                Vronsky's, and with the continual iteration of his name, would 
                force themselves on his attention. And it is as natural for a 
                child to hop about, as it was natural for him to talk well and 
                cleverly. He was saying: </p>
              <p> `Danger in the races to officers, to cavalrymen, is an essential 
                element in the race. If England can point to the most brilliant 
                feats of cavalry in military history, it is simply owing to the 
                fact that she has historically developed this force both in beasts 
                and in men. Sport has, in my opinion, a great value, and, as is 
                always the case, we see nothing but what is most superficial.' 
              </p>
              <p> `It's not superficial,' said Princess Tverskaia. `One of the 
                officers, they say, has broken two ribs.' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich smiled his smile, which uncovered his teeth, 
                but revealed nothing more. </p>
              <p> `We'll admit, Princess, that that's not superficial,' he said, 
                `but internal. But that's not the point,' and he turned again 
                to the general with whom he talked seriously; `we mustn't forget 
                that those who are taking part in the race are military men, who 
                have chosen that career, and one must allow that every calling 
                has its disagreeable side. It forms an integral part of the duties 
                of an officer. Low sports, such as prize fighting or Spanish bullfights, 
                are a sign of barbarity. But specialized trials of skill are a 
                sign of development.' </p>
              <p> `No, I shan't come another time; it's too upsetting,' said Princess 
                Betsy. `Isn't it, Anna?' </p>
              <p> `It is upsetting, but one can't tear oneself away,' said another 
                lady. `If I'd been a Roman woman I should never have missed a 
                single circus.' </p>
              <p> Anna said nothing, and, keeping her opera glass up, gazed always 
                at the same spot. </p>
              <p> At that moment a tall general walked through the pavilion. Breaking 
                off what he was saying, Alexei Alexandrovich got up hurriedly, 
                though with dignity, and bowed low to the general. </p>
              <p> `You're not racing?' the officer asked, chaffing him. </p>
              <p> `My race is a harder one,' Alexei Alexandrovich responded deferentially. 
              </p>
              <p> And though the answer meant nothing, the general looked as though 
                he had heard a witty remark from a witty man, and fully relished 
                la pointe de la sauce. </p>
              <p> `There are two aspects,' Alexei Alexandrovich resumed: `those 
                who take part and those who look on; and love for such spectacles 
                is an unmistakable proof of a low degree of development in the 
                spectator, I admit, but...' </p>
              <p> `Any bets, Princess?' sounded Stepan Arkadyevich's voice from 
                below, addressing Betsy. `Who's your favorite?' </p>
              <p> `Anna and I are for Kuzovlev,' replied Betsy. </p>
              <p> `I'm for Vronsky. A pair of gloves?' </p>
              <p> `Done!' </p>
              <p> `But it is a pretty sight, isn't it?' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich paused while the others were talking near 
                him, but he began again directly. </p>
              <p> `I admit that manly sports do not...' he made an attempt to 
                continue. </p>
              <p> But at that moment the racers started, and all conversation 
                ceased. Alexei Alexandrovich also fell silent, and everyone stood 
                up and turned toward the stream. Alexei Alexandrovich took no 
                interest in the race, and so he did not watch the racers, but 
                fell listlessly to scanning the spectators with his weary eyes. 
                His eyes rested upon Anna. </p>
              <p> Her face was white and stern. She was obviously seeing nothing 
                and no one but one man. Her hand had convulsively clutched her 
                fan, and she held her breath. He looked at her and hastily turned 
                away, scrutinizing other faces. </p>
              <p> `But here's this lady too, and others very much moved as well; 
                it's very natural,' Alexei Alexandrovich told himself He tried 
                not to look at her, but unconsciously his eyes were drawn to her. 
                He examined that face again, trying not to read what was so plainly 
                written on it, and against his own will, with horror, read in 
                it what he did not want to know. </p>
              <p> The first fall - Kuzovlev's, at the stream - agitated everyone, 
                but Alexei Alexandrovich saw distinctly on Anna's pale, triumphant 
                face that the man she was watching had not fallen. When, after 
                Makhotin and Vronsky had cleared the worst barrier, the next officer 
                had been thrown straight on his head at it and fatally injured, 
                and a shudder of horror passed over the whole public, Alexei Alexandrovich 
                saw that Anna did not even notice it, and had some difficulty 
                in realizing what they were saying around her. But more and more 
                often, and with greater persistence, he watched her. Anna, wholly 
                engrossed as she was with the sight of Vronsky racing, became 
                aware of her husband's cold eyes fixed upon her from aside. </p>
              <p> She glanced round for an instant, looked inquiringly at him, 
                and with a slight frown turned away again. </p>
              <p> `Ah, I don't care!' she seemed to say to him, and she did not 
                once glance at him again. </p>
              <p> The race was an unlucky one, and of the seventeen officers who 
                rode in it more than half had been thrown and hurt. Toward the 
                end of the race everyone was in a state of agitation, which was 
                intensified by the fact that the Czar was displeased. </p>

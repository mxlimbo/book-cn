              <p><br>
                The croquet party to which the Princess Tverskaia had invited 
                Anna was to consist of two ladies and their adorers. These two 
                ladies were the chief representatives of a select new Peterburg 
                circle, nicknamed, in imitation of some imitation, Les sept merveilles 
                du monde. These ladies belonged to a circle which, though of the 
                highest society, was utterly hostile to that in which Anna moved. 
                Moreover, old Stremov, one of the most influential people in Peterburg, 
                and the admirer of Liza Merkalova, was Alexei Alexandrovich's 
                enemy in the political world. From all these considerations Anna 
                had not meant to go, and the hints in Princess Tverskaia's note 
                referred to her refusal. But now Anna was eager to go, in the 
                hope of seeing Vronsky. <br>
                Anna arrived at Princess Tverskaia's earlier than the other guests. 
              </p>
              <p> At the very moment of her entry, Vronsky's footman, with his 
                side whiskers combed out, and looking like a Kammerjunker, went 
                in too. He stopped at the door, and, taking off his cap, let her 
                pass. Anna recognized him, and only then recalled that Vronsky 
                had told her the day before that he would not come. Most likely 
                he was sending a note to say so. </p>
              <p> As she took off her outer garment in the hall, she heard the 
                footman say, rolling his r's even like a Kammerjunker: `From the 
                Count for the Princess,' as he handed over the note. </p>
              <p> She longed to question him as to where his master was. She longed 
                to turn back and send him a letter to come and see her, or to 
                go herself to see him. But none of the three courses was possible. 
                Already she heard bells ringing ahead of her to announce her arrival, 
                and Princess Tverskaia's footman was standing at the open door 
                waiting for her to pass into the inner rooms. </p>
              <p> `The Princess is in the garden; she will be informed immediately. 
                Would you be pleased to walk into the garden?' announced another 
                footman in another room. </p>
              <p> The position of uncertainty, of indecision, was still the same 
                as at home - worse, in fact, since it was impossible to take any 
                step, impossible to see Vronsky, and she had to remain here among 
                outsiders, in company so uncongenial to her present mood. But 
                she was wearing a dress that she knew suited her. She was not 
                alone; all around was that luxurious setting of idleness that 
                she was used to, and she felt less wretched than at home. She 
                was not forced to think what she had to do. Everything would be 
                done of itself. On meeting Betsy coming toward her in a white 
                gown that struck her by its elegance, Anna smiled to her just 
                as she always did. Princess Tverskaia was walking with Tushkevich 
                and a young lady, a relation, who, to the great joy of her parents 
                in the provinces, was spending the summer with the fashionable 
                Princess. </p>
              <p> There was probably something unusual about Anna, for Betsy noticed 
                it at once. </p>
              <p> `I slept badly,' answered Anna, looking intently at the footman 
                who came to meet them, and, as she supposed, brought Vronsky's 
                note. </p>
              <p> `How glad I am you've come!' said Betsy. `I'm tired, and was 
                just longing to have some tea before they come. You might go,' 
                she turned to Tushkevich, `with Masha, and try the croquet ground 
                over there, where they've been clipping it. We shall have time 
                to talk a little over tea, we'll have a cozy chat, eh?' she said 
                in English to Anna, with a smile, pressing the hand which held 
                a parasol. </p>
              <p> `Yes, especially as I can't stay very long with you. I'm forced 
                to go on to old Madame Vrede. I've been promising to go for a 
                century,' said Anna, to whom lying, alien as it was to her nature, 
                had become not merely simple and natural in society, but a positive 
                source of satisfaction. Why she said this, which she had not thought 
                of a second before, she could not have explained. She had said 
                it simply from the reflection that as Vronsky would not be here, 
                she had better secure her own freedom, and try to see him somehow. 
                But why she had spoken of old Hoffraulein Vrede, whom she had 
                to go and see, as she had to see many other people, she could 
                not have explained; and yet, as it afterward turned out, had she 
                cudgeled her brains for the most cunning subterfuge to meet Vronsky, 
                she could have thought of nothing better. </p>
              <p> `No. I'm not going to let you go for anything,' answered Betsy, 
                looking intently into Anna's face. `Really, if I were not fond 
                of you, I should feel offended. One would think you were afraid 
                my society would compromise you. - Tea in the small dining room, 
                please,' she said, half closing her eyes, as she always did when 
                addressing the footman. </p>
              <p> Taking the note from him, she read it. </p>
              <p> `Alexei is playing us false,' she said in French; `he writes 
                that he can't come,' she added, in a tone as simple and natural 
                as though it could never enter her head that Vronsky could mean 
                anything more to Anna than a game of croquet. Anna knew that Betsy 
                knew everything, but, hearing how she spoke of Vronsky before 
                her, she almost felt persuaded for a minute that she knew nothing. 
              </p>
              <p> `Ah!' said Anna indifferently, as though not greatly interested 
                in the matter; and she went on, smiling: `How can you or your 
                friends compromise anyone?' </p>
              <p> This playing with words, this hiding of a secret, had a great 
                fascination for Anna, as, indeed, it has for all women. And it 
                was not the necessity of concealment, not the purpose for which 
                the concealment was contrived, but the process of concealment 
                itself which attracted her. </p>
              <p> `I can't be more catholic than the Pope,' she said. `Stremov 
                and Liza Merkalova - why, they're the cream of the cream of society. 
                Besides, they're received everywhere, and I' - she laid special 
                stress on the I - `have never been strict and intolerant. It's 
                simply that I haven't the time.' </p>
              <p> `No; you don't care, perhaps, to meet Stremov? Let him and Alexei 
                Alexandrovich tilt at each other in the Committee - that's no 
                affair of ours. But, in society, he's the most amiable man I know, 
                and an ardent croquet player. You shall see. And, in spite of 
                his absurd position as Liza's lovesick swain at his age, you ought 
                to see how he carries off the absurd position. He's very nice. 
                Don't you know Sappho Stoltz? Oh, that's a new type - quite new!' 
              </p>
              <p> Betsy went on with all this chatter, yet, at the same time, 
                from her good-humored, shrewd glance, Anna felt that she partly 
                guessed her plight, and was hatching something for her benefit. 
                They were in the little boudoir. </p>
              <p> `I must write to Alexei, though,' and Betsy sat down to the 
                table, scribbled a few lines, and put the note in an envelope. 
                `I'm telling him to come to dinner. I've one lady extra to dinner 
                with me, and no man to take her in. Look what I've said - will 
                that persuade him? Excuse me, I must leave you for a minute. Would 
                you seal it up, please, and send it off? she said from the door; 
                `I have to give some directions.' </p>
              <p> Without a moment's hesitation, Anna sat down to the table with 
                Betsy's letter, and, without reading it, wrote below: `It's essential 
                for me to see you. Come to the Vrede garden. I shall be there 
                at six o'clock.' She sealed it up, and, Betsy coming back, in 
                her presence handed the note for transmittal. </p>
              <p> At tea, which was brought them on a little tea table in the 
                cool little drawing room, a cozy chat promised by Princess Tverskaia 
                before the arrival of her visitors really did come off between 
                the two women. They criticized the people they were expecting, 
                and the conversation fell upon Liza Merkalova. </p>
              <p> `She's very sweet, and I always liked her,' said Anna. </p>
              <p> `You ought to like her. She raves about you. Yesterday she came 
                up to me after the races and was in despair at not finding you. 
                She says you're a real heroine of romance, and that if she were 
                a man she would do all sorts of mad things for your sake. Stremov 
                says she does that as it is.' </p>
              <p> `But do tell me, please - I never could make it out,' said Anna, 
                after being silent for some time, speaking in a tone that showed 
                she was not asking an idle question, but that what she was asking 
                was of greater importance to her than it should have been, `do 
                tell me, please: what are her relations with Prince Kaluzhsky 
                - Mishka, as he's called? I've met them so little. What does it 
                mean?' </p>
              <p> Betsy smiled with her eyes, and looked intently at Anna. </p>
              <p> `It's a new mode,' she said. `They've all adopted that mode. 
                They've flung their caps over the windmills. But there are ways 
                and ways of flinging them.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, but precisely what are her relations with Kaluzhsky?' 
              </p>
              <p> Betsy broke into unexpectedly mirthful and irrepressible laughter, 
                a thing which rarely happened with her. </p>
              <p> `You're encroaching on Princess Miaghkaia's special domain now. 
                That's the question of an enfant terrible,' and Betsy obviously 
                tried to restrain herself, but could not, and went off into peals 
                of that infectious laughter peculiar to people who do not laugh 
                often. `You'd better ask them,' she brought out, between tears 
                of laughter. </p>
              <p> `No; you laugh,' said Anna, laughing too, in spite of herself, 
                `but I never could understand it. I can't understand the husband's 
                role in it.' </p>
              <p> `The husband? Liza Merkalova's husband carries her shawl, and 
                is always ready to be of use. But no one cares to inquire about 
                what is really going on. You know, in decent society one doesn't 
                talk or think even of certain details of the toilet. That's how 
                it is in this case.' </p>
              <p> `Will you be at Madame Rolandaky's fete?' asked Anna, to change 
                the conversation. </p>
              <p> `I don't think so,' answered Betsy, and, without looking at 
                her friend, she began filling the little transparent cups with 
                fragrant tea. Putting a cup before Anna, she took out a thin cigarette, 
                and, fitting it into a silver holder, she lighted it. `It's like 
                this, you see: I'm in a fortunate position,' she began, quite 
                serious now, as she took up her cup. `I understand you, and I 
                understand Liza. Liza now is one of those naive natures that, 
                like children, don't know what's good and what's bad. Anyway, 
                she didn't comprehend it when she was very young. And now she's 
                aware that the lack of comprehension suits her. Now, perhaps, 
                she doesn't know on purpose,' said Betsy, with a subtle smile. 
                `But, anyway, it suits her. The very same thing, don't you see, 
                may be looked at tragically, and turned into misery, or it may 
                be looked at simply, and even humorously. Possibly you are inclined 
                to look at things too tragically.' </p>
              <p> `How I should like to know other people just as I know myself!' 
                said Anna, seriously and dreamily. `Am I worse than other people, 
                or better? I think I'm worse.' </p>
              <p> `Enfant terrible, enfant terrible!' repeated Betsy. `But here 
                they are.' </p>

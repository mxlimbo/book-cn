              <p><br>
                On the drive home, as Darya Alexandrovna, with all her children 
                round her, their heads still wet from their baths, and a kerchief 
                tied over her own head, was getting near the house, the coachman 
                said: `There's some gentleman coming: the master of Pokrovskoe, 
                I do believe.' </p>
              <p>Darya Alexandrovna peeped out in front, and was delighted when 
                she recognized in the gray hat and gray coat the familiar figure 
                of Levin walking to meet them. She was glad to see him at any 
                time, but at this moment she was specially glad he should see 
                her in all her glory. No one was better able to appreciate her 
                grandeur than Levin. </p>
              <p> Seeing her, he found himself face to face with one of the pictures 
                of his daydream of family life. </p>
              <p> `You're like a hen with your brood, Darya Alexandrovna.' </p>
              <p> `Ah, how glad I am to see you!' she said, holding out her hand 
                to him. </p>
              <p> `Glad to see me - but you didn't let me know. My brother's staying 
                with me. I got a note from Stiva that you were here.' </p>
              <p> `From Stiva?' Darya Alexandrovna asked with surprise. </p>
              <p> `Yes; he writes that you are here, and that he thinks you might 
                allow me to be of use to you,' said Levin, and as he said it he 
                became suddenly embarrassed, and, stopping abruptly, he walked 
                on in silence by the droshky, snapping off the buds of the lime 
                trees and nibbling them. He was embarrassed through a sense that 
                Darya Alexandrovna would be annoyed by receiving from an outsider 
                help that should by rights have come from her own husband. Darya 
                Alexandrovna certainly did not like this little way of Stepan 
                Arkadyevich's of foisting his domestic duties on others. And she 
                was at once aware that Levin was aware of this. It was just for 
                this fineness of perception, for this delicacy, that Darya Alexandrovna 
                liked Levin. </p>
              <p> `I know, of course,' said Levin, `that this simply means that 
                you would like to see me, and I'm exceedingly glad. Though I can 
                fancy that, used to town housekeeping as you are, you must feel 
                you are in the wilds here, and if there's anything wanted, I'm 
                altogether at your disposal.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, no!' said Dolly. `At first things were rather uncomfortable, 
                but now we've settled everything capitally - thanks to my old 
                nurse,' she said, indicating Matriona Philimonovna, who, seeing 
                that they were speaking of her, smiled brightly and cordially 
                to Levin. She knew him, and knew that he would be a good match 
                for her young lady, and was very keen to see the matter settled. 
              </p>
              <p> `Won't you get in, sir, we'll make room on this side!' she said 
                to him. </p>
              <p> `No, I'll walk. Children, who'd like to race the horses with 
                me?' </p>
              <p> The children knew Levin very little, and could not remember 
                when they had seen him, but they experienced in regard to him 
                none of that strange feeling of shyness and hostility which children 
                so often experience toward hypocritical, grown-up people, and 
                for which they are so often and miserably punished. Hypocrisy 
                in anything whatever may deceive the cleverest and most penetrating 
                man, but the least wide-awake of children recognizes it, and is 
                revolted by it, however ingeniously it may be disguised. Whatever 
                faults Levin had, there was not a trace of hypocrisy in him, and 
                so the children showed him the same friendliness that they saw 
                in their mother's face. On his invitation, the two elder ones 
                at once jumped out to him and ran with him as simply as they would 
                have done with their nurse, or Miss Hoole, or their mother. Lily, 
                too, began begging to go to him, and her mother handed her over 
                to him; he sat her on his shoulder and ran along with her. </p>
              <p> `Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, Darya Alexandrovna!' he said, 
                smiling good-humoredly to the mother; `there's no chance of my 
                hurting or dropping her.' </p>
              <p> And, looking at his strong, agile, assiduously careful and extremely 
                strained movements, the mother felt her mind at rest, and smiled 
                gaily and approvingly as she watched him. </p>
              <p> Here, in the country, with children, and with Darya Alexandrovna, 
                with whom he was in sympathy, Levin was in a mood not infrequent 
                with him, of childlike lightheartedness that she particularly 
                liked in him. As he ran with the children, he taught them gymnastic 
                feats, set Miss Hoole laughing with his queer English accent, 
                and talked to Darya Alexandrovna of his pursuits in the country. 
              </p>
              <p> After dinner, Darya Alexandrovna, sitting alone with him on 
                the balcony, began to speak of Kitty. </p>
              <p> `You know, Kitty's coming here, and is going to spend the summer 
                with me.' </p>
              <p> `Really,' he said, flushing; and at once, to change the conversation, 
                he said: `Then I'll send you two cows, shall I? If you insist 
                on a bill you shall pay me five roubles a month - if you aren't 
                ashamed.' </p>
              <p> `No, thank you. We can manage very well now.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, well, then, I'll have a look at your cows, and if you'll 
                allow me, I'll give directions about their food. Everything depends 
                on their food.' </p>
              <p> And Levin, to turn the conversation, explained to Darya Alexandrovna 
                the theory of cowkeeping, based on the principle that the cow 
                is simply a machine for the transformation of food into milk, 
                and so on. </p>
              <p> He talked of this, and passionately longed to hear more of Kitty, 
                and, at the same time, was afraid of hearing it. He dreaded the 
                breaking up of the inward peace he had gained with such effort. 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is 
                there to look after it?' Darya Alexandrovna responded reluctantly. 
              </p>
              <p> She had by now got her household matters so satisfactorily arranged, 
                thanks to Matriona Philimonovna, that she was disinclined to make 
                any change in them; besides, she had no faith in Levin's knowledge 
                of farming. General principles, as to the cow being a machine 
                for the production of milk, she looked on with suspicion. It seemed 
                to her that such principles could only be a hindrance in farm 
                management. It all seemed to her a far simpler matter: all that 
                was needed, as Matriona Philimonovna had explained, was to give 
                Brindle and Whitebreast more food and drink, and not to let the 
                cook carry all the kitchen slops to the laundrymaid's cow. That 
                was clear. But general propositions as to feeding on meal and 
                on grass were doubtful and obscure. And, what was most important, 
                she wanted to talk about Kitty. </p>

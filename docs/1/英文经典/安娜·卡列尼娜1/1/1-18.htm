              <p><br>
                Vronsky followed the guard to the carriage, and at the door of 
                the compartment he stopped short to make room for a lady who was 
                getting out. <br>
                With the habitual feeling of a man of the world, from one glance 
                at this lady's appearance Vronsky classified her as belonging 
                to the best society. He begged pardon, and was getting into the 
                carriage, but felt he must glance at her once more; not because 
                she was very beautiful, not because of that elegance and modest 
                grace which were apparent in her whole figure, but because in 
                the expression of her charming face, as she passed close by him, 
                there was something peculiarly caressing and soft. As he looked 
                round, she too turned her head. Her shining gray eyes, that looked 
                dark because of her thick lashes, rested with friendly attention 
                on his face, as though she were recognizing him, and then promptly 
                turned away to the passing crowd, as though seeking someone. In 
                that brief look Vronsky had time to notice the suppressed animation 
                which played over her face, and flitted between the brilliant 
                eyes and the faint smile that curved her red lips. It was as though 
                her nature were so brimming over with something that, against 
                her will, it showed itself now in the flash of her eyes, and now 
                in her smile. Deliberately she shrouded the light in her eyes, 
                but it shone against her will in her faintly perceptible smile. 
              </p>
              <p> Vronsky stepped into the carriage. His mother, a dried-up old 
                lady with black eyes and ringlets, screwed up her eyes, scanning 
                her son, and smiled slightly with her thin lips. Getting up from 
                the seat and handing her maid a handbag, she gave her little wrinkled 
                hand to her son to kiss, and lifting his head from her hand, kissed 
                him on the cheek. </p>
              <p> `You got my telegram? Quite well? Thank God.' </p>
              <p> `You had a good journey?' said her son, sitting down beside 
                her, and involuntarily listening to a woman's voice outside the 
                door. He knew it was the voice of the lady he had met at the door. 
              </p>
              <p> `All the same I don't agree with you,' said the lady's voice. 
              </p>
              <p> `It's the Peterburg view, madame.' </p>
              <p> `Not Peterburg, but simply feminine,' she responded. </p>
              <p> `Well, well, allow me to kiss your hand.' </p>
              <p> `Good-by, Ivan Petrovich. And would you see if my brother is 
                here, and send him to me?' said the lady in the doorway, and stepped 
                back again into the compartment. </p>
              <p> `Well, have you found your brother?' said Countess Vronskaia, 
                addressing the lady. </p>
              <p> Vronsky understood now that this was Madame Karenina. </p>
              <p> `Your brother is here,' he said, standing up. `Excuse me, I 
                did not know you, and, indeed, our acquaintance was so slight,' 
                said Vronsky bowing, `that no doubt you do not remember me.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, no,' said she, `I should have known you because your mother 
                and I have been talking, I think, of nothing but you all the way.' 
                As she spoke she let the animation that would insist on coming 
                out show itself in her smile. `And still no sign of my brother.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Do call him, Aliosha,' said the old countess. </p>
              <p> Vronsky stepped out onto the platform and shouted: `Oblonsky! 
                Here!' </p>
              <p> Madame Karenina, however, did not wait for her brother, but 
                catching sight of him she stepped out with her light, resolute 
                step. And as soon as her brother had reached her, with a gesture 
                that struck Vronsky by its decision and its grace, she flung her 
                left arm around his neck, drew him rapidly to her, and kissed 
                him warmly. Vronsky looked on, never taking his eyes from her, 
                and smiled, he could not have said why. But recollecting that 
                his mother was waiting for him, he went back again into the carriage. 
              </p>
              <p><br>
                `She's very sweet, isn't she?' said the Countess of Madame Karenina. 
                `Her husband put her with me, and I was delighted to have her. 
                We've been talking all the way. And so you, I hear... vous filez 
                le parfait amour. Tant mieux, mon cher, tant mieux.' </p>
              <p> `I don't know what you are referring to, maman,' he answered 
                coldly. `Come, maman, let us go.' </p>
              <p> Madame Karenina entered the carriage again to say good-by to 
                the Countess. </p>
              <p> `Well, Countess, you have met your son, and I my brother,' she 
                said gaily. `And all my stories are exhausted; I should have nothing 
                more to tell you.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, no,' said the Countess, taking her hand. `I could go all 
                around the world with you and never be dull. You are one of those 
                delightful women in whose company it's sweet either to be silent 
                or to chat. Now please don't fret over your son; you can't expect 
                never to be parted.' </p>
              <p> Madame Karenina stood quite still, holding herself very erect, 
                and her eyes were smiling. </p>
              <p> `Anna Arkadyevna,' the Countess said in explanation to her son, 
                `has a little son eight years old, I believe, and she has never 
                been parted from him before, and she keeps fretting over leaving 
                him.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, the Countess and I have been talking all the time, I of 
                my son and she of hers,' said Madame Karenina, and again a smile 
                lighted up her face - a caressing smile intended for him. </p>
              <p> `I am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored,' he said, 
                promptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him. But 
                apparently she did not care to pursue the conversation in that 
                strain, and she turned to the old Countess. </p>
              <p> `Thank you so much. The time has passed so quickly. Good-by, 
                Countess.' </p>
              <p> `Good-by, my love,' answered the Countess. `Let me kiss your 
                pretty face. I speak plainly, at my age, and I tell you simply 
                that I've lost my heart to you.' </p>
              <p> Stereotyped as the phrase was, Madame Karenina obviously believed 
                it and was delighted by it. She flushed, bent down slightly, and 
                put her cheek to the Countes'ss lips, drew herself up again, and, 
                with the same smile fluttering between her lips and her eyes, 
                she gave her hand to Vronsky. He pressed the little hand she gave 
                him, and was delighted, as though at something special, by the 
                energetic squeeze with which she freely and vigorously shook his 
                hand. She went out with the rapid step which bore her rather fully 
                developed figure with such strange lightness. </p>
              <p> `Very charming,' said the Countess. </p>
              <p> That was precisely what her son was thinking. His eyes followed 
                her till her graceful figure was out of sight, and then the smile 
                remained on his face. He saw out of the window how she went up 
                to her brother, put her arm in his, and began telling him something 
                animatedly - obviously something that had nothing to do with him, 
                Vronsky, and at that he felt annoyed. </p>
              <p> `Well, maman, are you perfectly well?' he repeated, turning 
                to his mother. </p>
              <p> `Everything has been delightful. Alexandre has been very good, 
                and Marie has grown very pretty. She's very interesting.' </p>
              <p> And she began telling him again of what interested her most 
                - the christening of her grandson, for which she had been staying 
                in Peterburg, and the special favor shown her elder son by the 
                Czar. </p>
              <p> `Here's Lavrentii,' said Vronsky, looking out of the window; 
                `now we can go, if you like.' </p>
              <p> The old butler who had traveled with the Countess came to the 
                carriage to announce that everything was ready, and the Countess 
                got up to go. </p>
              <p> `Come; there's not such a crowd now,' said Vronsky. </p>
              <p> The maid took a handbag and the lap dog, the butler and a porter 
                the other baggage. Vronsky gave his mother his arm; but just as 
                they were getting out of the carriage several men ran suddenly 
                by with panic-stricken faces. The stationmaster, too, ran by in 
                his extraordinarily colored cap. Obviously something unusual had 
                happened. The crowd was running to the tail end of the train. 
              </p>
              <p> `What?... What?... Where?... Flung himself!... Crushed!...' 
                was heard among the crowd. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich, with his sister on his arm, turned back. 
                They too looked scared, and stopped at the carriage door to avoid 
                the crowd. </p>
              <p> The ladies got in, while Vronsky and Stepan Arkadyevich followed 
                the crowd to find out details of the disaster. </p>
              <p> A watchman, either drunk or too much muffled up in the bitter 
                frost, had not heard the train moving back, and had been crushed. 
              </p>
              <p> Before Vronsky and Oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts 
                from the butler. </p>
              <p> Oblonsky and Vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse. Oblonsky 
                was evidently distressed. He frowned and seemed ready to cry. 
              </p>
              <p> `Ah, how awful! Ah, Anna, if you had seen it! Ah, how awful!' 
                he kept repeating. </p>
              <p> Vronsky did not speak; his handsome face was serious, but perfectly 
                calm. </p>
              <p> `Ah, if you had seen it, Countess,' said Stepan Arkadyevich. 
                `And his wife was there.... It was awful to see her!... She flung 
                herself on the body. They say he was the only support of an immense 
                family. How awful!' </p>
              <p> `Couldn't one do anything for her?' said Madame Karenina in 
                an agitated whisper. </p>
              <p> Vronsky glanced at her, and immediately got out of the carriage. 
              </p>
              <p> `I'll be back directly, maman,' he remarked, turning round in 
                the doorway. </p>
              <p> When he came back a few minutes later, Stepan Arkadyevich was 
                already in conversation with the Countess about a new singer, 
                while she was impatiently looking toward the door, waiting for 
                her son. </p>
              <p> `Now let us be off,' said Vronsky, coming in. </p>
              <p> They went out together. Vronsky was in front with his mother. 
                Behind walked Madame Karenina with her brother. Just as they were 
                going out of the station the stationmaster overtook Vronsky. </p>
              <p> `You gave my assistant two hundred roubles. Would you kindly 
                explain for whose benefit you intend them?' </p>
              <p> `For the widow,' said Vronsky, shrugging his shoulders. `I should 
                have thought there was no need to ask.' </p>
              <p> `You gave that?' cried Oblonsky behind, and, pressing his sister's 
                hand, he added: `Most charming, most charming! Isn't he a fine 
                fellow? Good-by, Countess.' </p>
              <p> And he and his sister stood still, looking for her maid. </p>
              <p> When they went out the Vronsky's carriage had already driven 
                away. People coming in were still talking of what had happened. 
              </p>
              <p> `What a horrible death!' said a gentleman, passing by. `They 
                say he was cut in two.' </p>
              <p> `On the contrary, I think it's the easiest - instantaneous,' 
                observed another. </p>
              <p> `How is it they don't take proper precautions?' a third was 
                saying. </p>
              <p> Madame Karenina seated herself in the carriage, and Stepan Arkadyevich 
                saw with surprise that her lips were quivering, and that she was 
                with difficulty restraining her tears. </p>
              <p> `What is it, Anna?' he asked, when they had driven a few hundred 
                sagenes. </p>
              <p> `It's an omen of evil,' she said. </p>
              <p> `What nonsense!' said Stepan Arkadyevich. `You've come, that's 
                the chief thing. You can't conceive how I'm resting my hopes on 
                you.' </p>
              <p> `Have you known Vronsky long? she asked. </p>
              <p> `Yes. You know we're hoping he will marry Kitty.' </p>
              <p> `Yes?' said Anna softly. `Come now, let us talk of you,' she 
                added, tossing her head, as though she would physically shake 
                off something superfluous oppressing her. `Let us talk of your 
                affairs. I got your letter, and here I am.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, all my hopes are in you,' said Stepan Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> `Well, tell me all about it.' </p>
              <p> And Stepan Arkadyevich began his story. </p>
              <p> On reaching home Oblonsky helped his sister out, sighed, pressed 
                her hand, and set off to his office. </p>

              <p align="center" class="h">Chapter 19</p>
              <p><br>
                In spite of Vronsky's apparently frivolous life in society, he 
                was a man who hated disorder. In early youth, in the Corps of 
                Pages, he had experienced the humiliation of a refusal, when he 
                had tried, being in difficulties, to borrow money, and since then 
                he had never once put himself in the same position again. </p>
              <p>In order to keep his affairs in some sort of order, he was wont, 
                about five times a year (more or less frequently, according to 
                circumstances), to shut himself up alone and put all his affairs 
                into definite shape. This he would call his day of washing up 
                or faire la lessive. </p>
              <p> On waking up late in the morning after the races, Vronsky put 
                on a white linen coat, and, without shaving or taking his bath, 
                he distributed about the table money, bills, and letters, and 
                set to work. Petritsky, who knew he was ill-tempered on such occasions, 
                on waking up and seeing his comrade at the writing table, quietly 
                dressed and went out without getting in his way. </p>
              <p> Every man who knows to the minutest details all the complexity 
                of the conditions surrounding him, cannot help imagining that 
                the complexity of these conditions, and the difficulty of making 
                them clear, is something exceptional and personal, peculiar to 
                himself, and never supposes that others are surrounded by just 
                as complicated an array of personal affairs as he is. So indeed 
                it seemed to Vronsky. And not without inward pride, and not without 
                reason, he thought that any other man would long ago have been 
                in difficulties, and would have been forced to some dishonorable 
                course, if he had found himself in such a difficult position. 
                But Vronsky felt that now especially it was essential for him 
                to clear up and define his position if he were to avoid getting 
                into difficulties. </p>
              <p> What Vronsky attacked first, as being the easiest, was his pecuniary 
                position. Writing out on note paper in his minute handwriting 
                all that he owed, he added up the amount and found that his debts 
                amounted to seventeen thousand and some odd hundreds, which he 
                left out for the sake of clearness. Reckoning up his cash and 
                the balance in his bankbook, he found that he had left one thousand 
                eight hundred roubles, and nothing coming in before the New Year. 
                Reckoning over again his list of debts, Vronsky copied it, dividing 
                it into three classes. In the first class he put the debts which 
                he would have to pay at once, or for which he must in any case 
                have the money ready so that on demand for payment there would 
                not be a moment's delay in paying. Such debts amounted to about 
                four thousand: one thousand five hundred for a horse, and two 
                thousand five hundred as surety for a young comrade, Venevsky, 
                who had lost that sum to a cardsharper in Vronsky's presence. 
                Vronsky had wanted to pay the money at the time (he had that amount 
                then), but Venevsky and Iashvin had insisted that they would pay 
                and not Vronsky, who had not played. So far, so good; but Vronsky 
                knew that in this dirty business, though his only share in it 
                was undertaking by word of mouth to be surety for Venevsky, it 
                was absolutely necessary for him to have the two thousand five 
                hundred roubles, so as to be able to fling it at the cheat, and 
                have no more words with him. And so, for this first and most important 
                division, he must have four thousand roubles. The second class 
                - eight thousand roubles - consisted of less important debts. 
                These were principally accounts owing in connection with his race 
                horses, to the purveyor of oats and hay, the Englishman, the saddler, 
                and so on. He would have to pay some two thousand roubles on these 
                debts too, in order to be quite free from anxiety. The last class 
                of debts - to shops, to hotels, to his tailor - were such as need 
                not be considered. So that he needed at least six thousand roubles, 
                and he only had one thousand eight hundred for current expenses. 
                For a man with one hundred thousand roubles of revenue, which 
                was what everyone fixed as Vronsky's income, such debts, one would 
                suppose, could hardly be embarrassing; but the fact was that he 
                was far from having one hundred thousand. His father's immense 
                property, which alone yielded a yearly income of two hundred thousand, 
                was left undivided between the brothers. At the time when the 
                elder brother, with a mass of debts, had married Princess Varia 
                Chirkova, the daughter of a Dekabrist without any fortune whatever, 
                Alexei had given up to his elder brother almost the whole income 
                from his father's estate, reserving for himself only twenty-five 
                thousand a year from it. Alexei had said at the time to his brother 
                that the sum would be sufficient for him until he married, which 
                he would probably never do. And his brother, who was in command 
                of one of the most expensive regiments, and was only just married, 
                could not decline the gift. His mother, who had her own separate 
                property, had allowed Alexei every year twenty thousand in addition 
                to the twenty-five thousand he had reserved, and Alexei had spent 
                it all. Of late his mother, incensed with him on account of his 
                love affair and his leaving Moscow, had given up sending him the 
                money. And, in consequence of this, Vronsky, who had been in the 
                habit of living on the scale of forty-five thousand a year, having 
                only received twenty thousand that year, now found himself in 
                difficulties. To get out of these difficulties, he could not apply 
                to his mother for money. Her last letter, which he had received 
                the day before, had particularly exasperated him by the hints 
                it contained that she was quite ready to help him to succeed in 
                the world and in the army, but not to lead a life which scandalized 
                all good society. His mother's attempt to buy him stung him to 
                the quick and made him feel colder than ever toward her. But he 
                could not draw back from the generous word when it was once uttered, 
                even though he felt now, vaguely foreseeing certain eventualities 
                in his liaison with Madame Karenina, that his generous word had 
                been spoken thoughtlessly, and that, even though he were not married, 
                he might need all the hundred thousand of income. But it was impossible 
                to draw back. He had only to recall his brother's wife, to remember 
                how that sweet, delightful Varia sought, at every convenient opportunity, 
                to remind him that she remembered his generosity and appreciated 
                it, to grasp the impossibility of taking back his gift. It was 
                as impossible as beating a woman, or stealing, or lying. One thing 
                only could and ought to be done, and Vronsky determined upon it 
                without an instant's hesitation: to borrow money from a moneylender, 
                ten thousand roubles, a proceeding which presented no difficulty; 
                to cut down his expenses generally, and to sell his race horses. 
                Resolving on this, he promptly wrote a note to Rolandaky, who 
                had more than once sent to him with offers to buy horses from 
                him. Then he sent for the Englishman and the moneylender, and 
                divided what money he had according to the accounts he intended 
                to pay. Having finished this business, he wrote a cold and cutting 
                answer to his mother. Then he took out of his notebook three notes 
                of Anna's, read them again, burned them, and, remembering their 
                conversation on the previous day, he sank into deep thought. </p>

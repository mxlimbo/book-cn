              <p> <br>
                On the way home Levin asked all the details of Kitty's illness 
                and of the Shcherbatskys' plans, and though he would have been 
                ashamed to admit it, he was pleased at what he heard. He was pleased 
                that there was still hope, and still more pleased that she, who 
                had made him suffer, should be suffering so much. But when Stepan 
                Arkadyevich began to speak of the causes of Kitty's illness, and 
                mentioned Vronsky's name, Levin cut him short. </p>
              <p>`I have no right whatever to know family matters, and, to tell 
                the truth, no interest in them either.' </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich smiled a barely perceptible smile, catching 
                the instantaneous change he knew so well in Levin's face, which 
                had become as gloomy as it had been bright a minute before. </p>
              <p> `Have you quite settled about the forest with Riabinin?' asked 
                Levin. </p>
              <p> `Yes, it's all settled. The price is magnificent - thirty-eight 
                thousand. Eight straightaway, and the rest in six years. I've 
                been bothering about it for ever so long. No one would give more.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Then you've as good as given away your forest for nothing,' 
                said Levin gloomily. </p>
              <p> `How do you mean - for nothing?' said Stepan Arkadyevich with 
                a good-humored smile, knowing that nothing would be right in Levin's 
                eyes now. </p>
              <p> `Because the forest is worth at least five hundred roubles the 
                dessiatina,' answered Levin. </p>
              <p> `Oh, these farmers!' said Stepan Arkadyevich playfully. `Your 
                tone of contempt for us poor townsfolk!... But when it comes to 
                business, we are better at it than anyone. I assure you I have 
                reckoned it all out,' he said, `and the forest is fetching a very 
                good price - so much so that I'm afraid of this fellow's crying 
                off, in fact. You know it's not ``timber forest,'' said Stepan 
                Arkadyevich, hoping by this distinction to convince Levin completely 
                of the unfairness of his doubts, `but for the most part firewood. 
                And it won't run to more than thirty sazhenes of wood per dessiatina, 
                and he's paying me at the rate of two hundred roubles the dessiatina.' 
              </p>
              <p> Levin smiled contemptuously. `I know,' he thought, `that fashion 
                not only in him, but in all city people, who, after being twice 
                in ten years in the country, pick up two or three phrases and 
                use them in season and out of season, firmly persuaded that they 
                know all about it. ``Timber, run to thirty sazhenes the dessiatina.'' 
                He says those words without understanding them himself.' </p>
              <p> `I wouldn't attempt to teach you what you write about in your 
                office,' said he, `and if need arose, I should come to you to 
                ask about it. But you're so positive you know all the lore of 
                the forest. It's difficult. Have you counted the trees?' </p>
              <p> `How count the trees?' said Stepan Arkadyevich, laughing, still 
                trying to draw his friend out of his ill temper. `Count sands 
                of seas, and rays of stars, though could some higher power...' 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, well, the higher power of Riabinin can. Not a single merchant 
                ever buys a forest without counting the trees, unless they get 
                it given them for nothing, as you're doing now. I know your forest. 
                I go there every year shooting, and your forest's worth five hundred 
                a dessiatina paid down, while he's giving you two hundred by installments. 
                So that in fact you're making him a present of thirty thousand.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Come, don't let your imagination run away with you,' said Stepan 
                Arkadyevich piteously. `Why was it none would give it, then?' 
              </p>
              <p> `Why, because he has an understanding with the merchants; he's 
                bought them off. I've had to do with all of them; I know them. 
                They're not merchants, you know; they're speculators. He wouldn't 
                look at a bargain that gave him ten, fifteen per cent profit, 
                but holds back to buy a rouble's worth for twenty kopecks.' </p>
              <p> `Well, enough of it! You're out of temper.' </p>
              <p> `Not in the least,' said Levin gloomily, as they drove up to 
                the house. </p>
              <p> At the steps there stood a trap tightly covered with iron and 
                leather, with a sleek horse tightly harnessed with broad collar 
                straps. In the trap sat the chubby, tightly belted overseer who 
                served Riabinin as coachman. Riabinin himself was already in the 
                house, and met the friends in the hall. Riabinin was a tall, thinnish, 
                middle-aged man, with mustache and a projecting clean-shaven chin, 
                and prominent muddy-looking eyes. He was dressed in a long-skirted 
                blue coat, with buttons below the waist at the back, and wore 
                high boots wrinkled over the ankles and straight over the calf, 
                with big galoshes drawn over them. He mopped his face with his 
                handkerchief, and, wrapping himself in his coat, which sat extremely 
                well as it was, he greeted them with a smile, holding out his 
                hand to Stepan Arkadyevich, as though he wanted to catch something. 
              </p>
              <p> `So, here you are,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, giving him his 
                hand. `That's capital.' </p>
              <p> `I did not venture to disregard Your Excellency's commands, 
                though the road was extremely bad. I positively covered the whole 
                way at a walk, but I am here on time. Konstantin Dmitrich, my 
                respects&quot;; he turned to Levin, trying to seize his hand too. 
                But Levin, scowling, made as though he did not notice his hand, 
                and took out the woodcocks. `Your honors have been diverting yourselves 
                with the chase? What kind of bird may it be, pray?' added Riabinin, 
                looking contemptuously at the woodcocks: `a great delicacy, I 
                suppose.' And he shook his head disapprovingly, as though he had 
                grave doubts whether this game were worth the candle. </p>
              <p> `Would you like to go into my study?' Levin said in French to 
                Stepan Arkadyevich, scowling morosely. `Go into my study; you 
                can talk there.' </p>
              <p> `Quite so, wherever you please,' said Riabinin with supercilious 
                dignity, as though wishing to make it felt that others might be 
                in difficulties as to how to behave, but that he could never be 
                in any difficulty about anything. </p>
              <p> On entering the study Riabinin looked about, as it was a habit 
                of his, as though seeking a holy image, but, when he had found 
                it, he did not cross himself. He scanned the bookcases and bookshelves, 
                and with the same dubious air with which he had regarded the woodcocks, 
                he smiled superciliously and shook his head disapprovingly, as 
                though by no means willing to allow that this game, either, were 
                worth the candle. </p>
              <p> `Well, have you brought the money?' asked Oblonsky. `Sit down.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, don't trouble about the money. I've come to see you to 
                talk it over.' </p>
              <p> `What is there to talk over? But do sit down.' </p>
              <p> `I don't mind if I do,' said Riabinin, sitting down and leaning 
                his elbows on the back of his armchair in a position of the intensest 
                discomfort to himself. `You must knock it down a bit, Prince. 
                It would be a sin otherwise. As for the money, it is ready definitively, 
                to the last kopeck. As for money down, there'll be no hitch there.' 
              </p>
              <p> Levin, who had meanwhile been putting his gun away in the cupboard, 
                was just going out of the door, but catching the merchant's words, 
                he stopped. </p>
              <p> `Why, you've got the forest for nothing as it is,' he said. 
                `He came to me too late, or I'd have fixed the price for him.' 
              </p>
              <p> Riabinin got up, and in silence, with a smile, he looked up 
                at Levin. </p>
              <p> `Konstantin Dmitrievich is very close,' he said with a smile, 
                turning to Stepan Arkadyevich; `there's definitively no dealing 
                with him. I was bargaining for some wheat of him, and a pretty 
                price I offered too.' </p>
              <p> `Why should I give you what's mine for nothing? I didn't pick 
                it up off the ground, nor did I steal it, either.' </p>
              <p> `Mercy on us! Nowadays there's positively no chance at all of 
                stealing. With the definitively open courts, and everything done 
                in style, nowadays there's no question of stealing. We are just 
                talking things over like gentlemen. His Excellency's asking too 
                much for the forest. I can't make both ends meet over it. I must 
                ask for a little concession.' </p>
              <p> `But is the thing settled between you or isn't it? If it's settled, 
                it's useless haggling; but if it isn't,' said Levin, `I'll buy 
                the forest.' </p>
              <p> The smile vanished at once from Riabinin's face. A hawklike, 
                greedy, cruel expression was left upon it. With rapid, bony fingers 
                he unbuttoned his coat, revealing a large shirt, bronze waistcoat 
                buttons, and a watch chain, and quickly pulled out a fat old pocketbook. 
              </p>
              <p> `Here you are, the forest is mine,' he said, crossing himself 
                quickly, and holding out his hand. `Take the money; it's my forest. 
                That's Riabinin's way of doing business; he doesn't haggle over 
                every copper,' he added, scowling and waving the pocketbook. </p>
              <p> `I wouldn't be in a hurry if I were you,' said Levin. </p>
              <p> `Come, really,' said Oblonsky in surprise, `I've given my word, 
                you know.' </p>
              <p> Levin went out of the room, slamming the door. Riabinin looked 
                toward the door and shook his head with a smile. </p>
              <p> `It's all youthfulness - definitively nothing but childishness. 
                Why, I'm buying it, upon my honor, simply, believe me, for the 
                glory of it, that Riabinin, and no one else, should have bought 
                the copse of Oblonsky. And as to the profits, why, I must make 
                what God gives. God's my witness. If you would kindly sign the 
                title deed...' </p>
              <p> Within an hour the merchant, carefully stroking his wrapper 
                down, and hooking up his coat, with the agreement in his pocket, 
                seated himself in his tightly covered trap, and drove homeward. 
              </p>
              <p> `Ugh, these gentlefolk!' he said to the overseer. `They are 
                all made alike! they're a fine lot!' </p>
              <p> `That's so,' responded the overseer, handing him the reins and 
                buttoning the leather apron. `But can I congratulate you on the 
                purchase, Mikhail Ignatich?' </p>
              <p> `Well, well...' </p>

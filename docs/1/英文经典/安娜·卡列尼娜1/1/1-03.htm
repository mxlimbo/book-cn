              <p><br>
                When he was dressed, Stepan Arkadyevich sprinkled some scent on 
                himself, pulled down his shirt cuffs, distributed into his pockets 
                his cigarettes, pocketbook, matches and watch, with its double 
                chain and seals, and, shaking out his handkerchief, feeling himself 
                clean, fragrant, healthy and physically at ease, in spite of his 
                misfortune, he walked with a slight swing of each leg into the 
                dining room, where coffee was already waiting for him - and, alongside 
                of his cup, the letters and papers from the office. </p>
              <p>He read the letters. One was very unpleasant, from a merchant 
                who was buying a forest on his wife's property. To sell this forest 
                was absolutely essential; but at present, until he was reconciled 
                with his wife, the subject could not be discussed. The most unpleasant 
                thing of all was that his pecuniary interests should in this way 
                enter into the question of his reconciliation with his wife. And 
                the idea that he might be led on by his interests, that he might 
                seek a reconciliation with his wife on account of the sale of 
                the forest - that idea hurt him. </p>
              <p> When he had finished his letters, Stepan Arkadyevich moved the 
                office papers close to him, rapidly looked through two cases, 
                made a few notes with a big pencil, and, pushing away the papers, 
                turned to his coffee. Sipping it, he opened a still damp morning 
                paper and began to read it. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich took in and read a liberal paper, not an 
                extreme one, but one advocating the views held by the majority. 
                And in spite of the fact that science, art and politics had no 
                special interest for him, he firmly held those views on all these 
                subjects which were held by the majority and by his paper, and 
                he only changed them when the majority changed them - or, more 
                strictly speaking, he did not change them, but they imperceptibly 
                changed of themselves within him. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich had not chosen his political opinions or 
                his views - these political opinions and views had come to him 
                of themselves - just as he did not choose the shapes of his hat 
                and coat, but simply accepted those that were being worn. And 
                for him, living in a certain society - owing to the need, ordinarily 
                developed at years of discretion, for some degree of mental activity 
                - to have views was just as indispensable as to have a hat. If 
                there was a reason for his preferring liberal to conservative 
                views, which were held also by many of his circle, it arose not 
                from his considering liberalism more rational, but from its being 
                in closer accordance with his manner of life. The liberal party 
                said that in Russia everything was wrong, and indeed Stepan Arkadyevich 
                had many debts and was decidedly short of money. The liberal party 
                said that marriage was an institution quite out of date, and that 
                it stood in need of reconstruction, and indeed family life afforded 
                Stepan Arkadyevich little gratification, and forced him into lying 
                and hypocrisy, which were so repulsive to his nature. The liberal 
                party said, or rather allowed it to be understood, that religion 
                was only a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the 
                people, and indeed Stepan Arkadyevich could not stand through 
                even a short service without his legs aching, and could never 
                make out what was the object of all the terrible and high-flown 
                language about another world when life might be so very amusing 
                in this world. And with all this Stepan Arkadyevich, who liked 
                a merry joke, was fond of embarrassing some plain man by saying 
                that if one were to pride oneself on one's origin, one ought not 
                to stop at Rurik and disown the founder of the line - the monkey. 
                And so liberalism had become a habit of Stepan Arkadyevich, and 
                he liked his newspaper, as he did his cigar after dinner, for 
                the slight fog it diffused in his brain. He read the leading article, 
                which maintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise 
                an outcry that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative 
                elements, and that the government ought to take measures to crush 
                the revolutionary hydra; that, on the contrary, `in our opinion 
                the danger lies not in that imaginary revolutionary hydra, but 
                in the obstinacy of traditionalism clogging progress,' etc., etc. 
                He read another article, too, a financial one, which alluded to 
                Bentham and Mill, and dropped some innuendoes reflecting on the 
                ministry. With his characteristic quick-wittedness he caught the 
                drift of each innuendo, divined whence it came, at whom and on 
                what ground it was aimed, and that afforded him, as it always 
                did, a certain gratification. But today that gratification was 
                embittered by Matriona Philimonovna's advice and the unsatisfactory 
                state of his household. He read, too, that Count Beist was rumored 
                to have left for Wiesbaden, and that one need have no more gray 
                hair, and of the sale of a light carriage, and of a young person 
                seeking a situation; but these items of information did not give 
                him, as usual, a quiet, ironical gratification. </p>
              <p> Having finished the paper, a second cup of coffee and a roll 
                and butter, he got up, shaking the crumbs off his waistcoat; and, 
                squaring his broad chest, he smiled joyously; not because there 
                was anything particularly agreeable in his mind - the joyous smile 
                was evoked by a good digestion. </p>
              <p> But this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him, and 
                he grew thoughtful. </p>
              <p> Two childish voices (Stepan Arkadyevich recognized the voices 
                of Grisha, his youngest boy, and Tania, his eldest girl) were 
                heard outside the door. They were carrying something, and dropped 
                it. </p>
              <p> `I told you not to sit passengers on the roof,' said the little 
                girl in English; `there, pick them up!' </p>
              <p> `Everything's in confusion,' thought Stepan Arkadyevich; `there 
                are the children running about by themselves.' And going to the 
                door, he called them. They left off the box that represented a 
                train, and came in to their father. </p>
              <p> The little girl, her father's favorite, ran up boldly, embraced 
                him and hung laughingly on his neck, enjoying as she always did 
                the well-known smell of scent that came from his whiskers. At 
                last the little girl kissed his face, which was flushed from his 
                stooping posture and beaming with tenderness, loosed her hands, 
                and was about to run away again; but her father held her back. 
              </p>
              <p> `How is mamma?' he asked, passing his hand over his daughter's 
                smooth, soft little neck. `Good morning,' he said, smiling to 
                the boy, who had come up to greet him. </p>
              <p> He was conscious that he loved the boy less, and always tried 
                to be fair; but the boy felt it, and did not smile responsively 
                to his father's chilly smile. </p>
              <p> `Mamma? She is up,' answered the girl. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich sighed. </p>
              <p> `That means she hasn't slept again all night,' he thought. </p>
              <p> `Well, is she cheerful?' </p>
              <p> The little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father 
                and mother, and that her mother could not be cheerful, and that 
                her father must be aware of this, and that he was pretending when 
                he asked about it so lightly. And she blushed for her father. 
                He at once perceived it, and blushed too. </p>
              <p> `I don't know,' she said. `She did not say we must do our lessons, 
                but she said we were to go for a walk with Miss Hoole to grandmamma's.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, go, Tania, my darling. Oh, wait a minute, though,' he 
                said, still holding her and stroking her soft little hand. </p>
              <p> He took off the mantelpiece, where he had put it yesterday, 
                a little box of sweets, and gave her two, picking out her favorites, 
                a chocolate and a bonbon. </p>
              <p> `For Grisha?' said the little girl, pointing to the chocolate. 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes.' And still stroking her little shoulder, he kissed 
                the nape of her neck, and let her go. </p>
              <p> `The carriage is ready,' said Matvei; `but there's someone to 
                see you with a petition.' </p>
              <p> `Been here long?' asked Stepan Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> `Half an hour or so.' </p>
              <p> `How many times have I told you to tell me at once?' </p>
              <p> `One must let you drink your coffee in peace, at least,' said 
                Matvei, in the affectionately gruff tone with which it was impossible 
                to be angry. </p>
              <p> `Well, show the person up at once,' said Oblonsky, frowning 
                with vexation. </p>
              <p> The petitioner, the widow of a staff captain Kalinin, came with 
                a request impossible and unreasonable; but Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                as he generally did, made her sit down, heard her to the end attentively 
                without interrupting her, and gave her detailed advice as to how 
                and to whom to apply, and even wrote for her, easily and clearly, 
                in his large, sprawling calligraphic and legible hand, a little 
                note to a personage who might be of use to her. Having got rid 
                of the staff captain's widow, Stepan Arkadyevich took his hat 
                and stopped to recollect whether he had forgotten anything. It 
                appeared that he had forgotten nothing except what he wanted to 
                forget - his wife. </p>
              <p> `Ah, yes!' He bowed his head, and his handsome face assumed 
                a melancholy expression. `To go, or not to go?' he said to himself; 
                and an inner voice told him he must not go, that nothing could 
                come of it but falsity; that to amend, to set right their relations 
                was impossible, because it was impossible to make her attractive 
                again and able to inspire love, or to make him an old man, not 
                susceptible to love. Except deceit and lying nothing could come 
                of it now; and deceit and lying were opposed to his nature. </p>
              <p> `It must be some day, though: it can't go on like this,' he 
                said, trying to give himself courage. He set straight his chest, 
                took out a cigarette, lighted it, took two whiffs at it, flung 
                it into a mother-of-pearl ash tray, and with rapid steps walked 
                through the drawing room and opened the other door into his wife's 
                bedroom. </p>

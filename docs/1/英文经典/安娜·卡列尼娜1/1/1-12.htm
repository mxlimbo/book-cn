              <p><br>
                The young princess Kitty Shcherbatskaia was eighteen. It was the 
                first winter that she had been out in the world. Her success in 
                society had been greater than that of either of her elder sisters, 
                and greater even than her mother had anticipated. To say nothing 
                of the young men who danced at the Moscow balls being almost all 
                in love with Kitty, two serious suitors had already, the first 
                winter, made their appearance: Levin, and, immediately after his 
                departure, Count Vronsky. </p>
              <p>Levin's appearance at the beginning of the winter, his frequent 
                visits, and evident love for Kitty, had led to the first serious 
                conversations between Kitty's parents as to her future, and to 
                disputes between them. The Prince was on Levin's side; he said 
                he wished for nothing better for Kitty. The Princess for her part, 
                going round the question in the manner peculiar to women, maintained 
                that Kitty was too young, that Levin had done nothing to prove 
                that he had serious intentions, that Kitty felt no great attraction 
                to him, and there were some other reasons too; but she did not 
                state the principal point, which was that she looked for a better 
                match for her daughter, that Levin was not to her liking, and 
                that she did not understand him. When Levin had abruptly departed, 
                the Princess was delighted, and said to her husband triumphantly: 
                ``You see, I was right.'' When Vronsky appeared on the scene, 
                she was still more delighted, confirmed in her opinion that Kitty 
                was to make not simply a good, but a brilliant match. </p>
              <p> In the mother's eyes there could be no comparison between Vronsky 
                and Levin. The mother disliked in Levin his strange and uncompromising 
                opinions and his shyness in society, founded on his pride, as 
                she supposed, and his queer sort of life, as she considered it, 
                absorbed in cattle and peasants. She did not very much like it 
                that he, who was in love with her daughter, had kept coming to 
                the house for six weeks, as though he were waiting for something, 
                inspecting, as though he were afraid he might be doing them too 
                great an honor by making a proposal, and did not realize that 
                a man who continually visits at a house where there is a young 
                unmarried girl, is bound to make his intentions clear. And suddenly, 
                without doing so, he disappeared. `It's as well he's not attractive 
                enough for Kitty to have fallen in love with him,' thought the 
                mother. </p>
              <p> Vronsky satisfied all the mother's desires. Very wealthy, clever, 
                of aristocratic family, on the highroad to a brilliant career 
                in the army and at court, and a fascinating man. Nothing better 
                could be wished for. </p>
              <p> Vronsky openly flirted with Kitty at balls, danced with her, 
                and came continually to the house; consequently there could be 
                no doubt of the seriousness of his intentions. But, in spite of 
                that, the mother had spent the whole of that winter in a state 
                of terrible anxiety and agitation. </p>
              <p> Princess Shcherbatskaia had herself been married thirty years 
                ago, her aunt arranging the match. The wooer, about whom everything 
                was well known beforehand, had come, looked at his intended, and 
                been looked at. The matchmaking aunt had ascertained and communicated 
                their mutual impression. That impression had been favorable. Afterward, 
                on a day fixed beforehand, the expected proposal was made to her 
                parents, and accepted. All had passed very simply and easily. 
                So it seemed, at least, to the Princess. But over her own daughters 
                she had felt how far from simple and easy is the business, apparently 
                so commonplace, of marrying off one's daughters. The panics that 
                had been lived through, the thoughts that had been brooded over, 
                the money that had been wasted, and the disputes with her husband 
                over marrying the two elder girls, Darya and Natalya! Now, since 
                the youngest began to come out in the world, the Princess was 
                going through the same terrors, the same doubts, and still more 
                violent quarrels with her husband, than she had over the elder 
                girls. The old Prince, like all fathers indeed, was exceedingly 
                scrupulous on the score of the honor and reputation of his daughters; 
                he was unreasonably jealous over his daughters, especially over 
                Kitty, who was his favorite, and at every turn he had scenes with 
                the Princess for compromising her daughter. The Princess had grown 
                accustomed to this already with her other daughters, but now she 
                felt that there was more ground for the Prince's scrupulousness. 
                She saw that of late years much was changed in the manners of 
                society, that a mother's duties had become still more difficult. 
                She saw that girls of Kitty's age formed some sort of clubs, went 
                to some sort of lectures, mixed freely in men's society, drove 
                about the streets alone; many of them did not curtsy; and, what 
                was the most important thing, all of them were firmly convinced 
                that to choose their husband was their own affair, and not their 
                parent's. `Marriages aren't made nowadays as they used to be,' 
                was thought and said by all these young girls, and even by their 
                elders. But just how marriages were made nowadays, the Princess 
                could not learn from anyone. The French fashion - of the parents 
                arranging their children's future - was not accepted; it was condemned. 
                The English fashion of the complete independence of girls was 
                also not accepted, and not possible in Russian society. The Russian 
                fashion of matchmaking was considered unseemly; it was ridiculed 
                by everyone - even by the Princess herself. But how girls were 
                to be married, and how parents were to marry them, no one knew. 
                Everyone with whom the Princess had chanced to discuss the matter 
                said the same thing: `Mercy on us, it's high time in our day to 
                cast off all that old-fashioned business. It's the young people 
                have to marry, and not their parents; and so we ought to leave 
                the young people to arrange it as they choose.' It was very easy 
                for anyone to say who had no daughters, but the Princess realized 
                that, in the process of getting to know each other, her daughter 
                might fall in love, and fall in love with someone who did not 
                care to marry her, or who was quite unfit to be her husband. And, 
                however much it was instilled into the Princess that in our times 
                young people ought to arrange their lives for themselves, she 
                was unable to believe it, just as she would have been unable to 
                believe that, at any time whatever, loaded pistols were the most 
                suitable playthings for children five years old. And so the Princess 
                was more uneasy over Kitty than she had been over the elder daughters. 
              </p>
              <p> Now she was afraid that Vronsky might confine himself to simply 
                flirting with her daughter. She saw that her daughter was in love 
                with him, but tried to comfort herself with the thought that he 
                was an honorable man, and would not do this. But at the same time 
                she knew how easy it is, with the freedom of manners of today, 
                to turn a girl's head, and how lightly men generally regard such 
                a crime. The week before, Kitty had told her mother of a conversation 
                she had with Vronsky during a mazurka. This conversation had partly 
                reassured the Princess; yet her assurance could not be perfect. 
                Vronsky had told Kitty that both he and his brother were so used 
                to obeying their mother that they never made up their minds to 
                any important undertaking without consulting her. `And, just now, 
                I am impatiently awaiting my mother's coming from Peterburg, as 
                a peculiar piece of luck,' he had told her. </p>
              <p> Kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to 
                the words. But her mother saw them in a different light. She knew 
                that the old lady was expected from day to day, that she would 
                be pleased at her son's choice, and she felt it strange that he 
                should not make his proposal through fear of vexing his mother. 
                However, she was so anxious for the marriage itself, and still 
                more for relief from her fears, that she believed it was so. Bitter 
                as it was for the Princess to see the unhappiness of her eldest 
                daughter, Dolly, on the point of leaving her husband, her anxiety 
                over the decision of her youngest daughter's fate engrossed all 
                her feelings. Today, with Levin's reappearance, a fresh source 
                of anxiety arose. She was afraid that her daughter, who had at 
                one time, as she fancied, a feeling for Levin, might, from an 
                extreme sense of honesty, refuse Vronsky, and that Levin's arrival 
                might generally complicate and delay the affair, now so near conclusion. 
              </p>
              <p> `Why, has he been here long?' the Princess asked about Levin, 
                as they returned home. </p>
              <p> `He came today, maman.' </p>
              <p> `There's one thing I want to say...' began the Princess, and 
                from her serious and alert face, Kitty guessed what it would be. 
              </p>
              <p> `Mamma,' she said, flushing hotly and turning quickly to her, 
                `please, please don't say anything about that. I know, I know 
                all about it.' </p>
              <p> She wished what her mother wished for, but the motives of her 
                mother's wishes hurt her. </p>
              <p> `I only want to say that to raise hopes...' </p>
              <p> `Mamma, darling, for goodnes's sake, don't talk about it. It's 
                so horrible to talk about it.' </p>
              <p> `I won't,' said her mother, seeing the tears in her daughter's 
                eyes; `but one thing, my love; you promised me you would have 
                no secrets from me. You won't?' </p>
              <p> `Never, mamma - none,' answered Kitty, flushing and looking 
                her mother straight in the face; `but I have nothing to tell you 
                now, and I... I... If I wanted to, I don't know what to say or 
                how... I don't know...' </p>
              <p> `No, she could not tell an untruth with those eyes,' thought 
                the mother, smiling at her agitation and happiness. The Princess 
                smiled: so immense and so important seemed to the poor child everything 
                that was taking place just now in her soul. </p>

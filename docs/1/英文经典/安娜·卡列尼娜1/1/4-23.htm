              <p><br>
                Vronsky's wound had been a dangerous one, though it did not touch 
                the heart, and for several days he hovered between life and death. 
                The first time he was able to speak, Varia, his brother's wife, 
                was alone in the room. <br>
                `Varia,' he said, looking sternly at her, `I shot myself by accident. 
                And please never speak of it, and tell everyone so. Or else it's 
                too ridiculous.' </p>
              <p> Without answering his words, Varia bent over him, and with a 
                delighted smile gazed into his face. His eyes were clear, not 
                feverish; but their expression was stern. </p>
              <p> `Thank God!' she said. `You're not in pain?' </p>
              <p> `A little here,' he pointed to his breast. </p>
              <p> `Then let me change your bandages.' </p>
              <p> In silence, stiffening his broad jaws, he looked at her while 
                she bandaged him up. When she had finished he said: </p>
              <p> `I'm not delirious. Please manage that there may be no talk 
                of my having shot myself on purpose.' </p>
              <p> `No one says so. Only I hope you won't shoot yourself by accident 
                any more,' she said, with a questioning smile. </p>
              <p> `I think I won't, but it would have been better...' </p>
              <p> And he smiled gloomily. </p>
              <p> In spite of these words and this smile, which so frightened 
                Varia, when the inflammation was over and he began to recover, 
                he felt that he was completely free from one part of his misery. 
                By his action he had, as it were, washed away the shame and humiliation 
                he had felt before. He could now think calmly of Alexei Alexandrovich. 
                He recognized all his magnanimity, but he did not now feel himself 
                humiliated by it. Besides, he got back again into the beaten track 
                of his life. He saw the possibility of looking men in the face 
                again without shame, and he could live in accordance with his 
                own habits. One thing he could not pluck out of his heart, though 
                he never ceased struggling with it - the regret, amounting to 
                despair, at having lost her forever. That, having expiated his 
                sin against the husband, he was now bound to renounce her, and 
                never in future to stand between her with her repentance and her 
                husband, he had firmly decided in his heart; but he could not 
                tear out of his heart his regret at the loss of her love; he could 
                not erase from his memory those moments of happiness which he 
                had known with her and had so little prized at the time, and which 
                haunted him with all their charm. </p>
              <p> Serpukhovskoy had planned his appointment at Tashkend, and Vronsky 
                agreed to the proposal without the slightest hesitation. But the 
                nearer the time of departure came, the bitterer was the sacrifice 
                he was making to what he thought his duty. </p>
              <p> His wound had healed, and he was driving about making preparations 
                for his departure for Tashkend. </p>
              <p> `To see her once, and then to bury myself, to die,' he thought, 
                and, as he was paying farewell visits, he uttered this thought 
                to Betsy. Charged with this commission, Betsy had gone to Anna, 
                and brought him back a negative reply. </p>
              <p> `So much the better,' thought Vronsky, when he received the 
                news. `It was a weakness which would have shattered what strength 
                I have left.' </p>
              <p> Next day Betsy herself came to him in the morning, and announced 
                that she had heard through Oblonsky, as a positive fact, that 
                Alexei Alexandrovich had agreed to a divorce, and that therefore 
                Vronsky could see Anna. </p>
              <p> Without even troubling himself to see Betsy out of his flat, 
                forgetting all his resolutions, without asking when he could see 
                her or where her husband was, Vronsky drove straight to the Karenins'. 
                He ran up the stairs, seeing no one and nothing, and with a rapid 
                step, almost breaking into a run, he went into her room. And without 
                considering, without noticing whether there was anyone in the 
                room or not, he flung his arms round her, and began to cover with 
                kisses her face, her hands, her neck. </p>
              <p> Anna had been preparing herself for this meeting, had thought 
                what she would say to him, but she did not succeed in saying anything; 
                his passion mastered her. She tried to calm him, to calm herself, 
                but it was too late. His feeling infected her. Her lips trembled 
                so that for a long while she could say nothing. </p>
              <p> `Yes, you have conquered me, and I am yours,' she said at last, 
                pressing his hands to her bosom. </p>
              <p> `So it had to be,' he said. `So long as we live, it must be 
                so. I know it now.' </p>
              <p> `That's true,' she said, getting whiter and whiter, and embracing 
                his head. `Still, there is something terrible in it after all 
                that has happened.' </p>
              <p> `It will all pass, it will all pass; we shall be so happy. Our 
                love, if it only could be stronger, will be strengthened by there 
                being something terrible in it,' he said, lifting his head and 
                showing his strong teeth in a smile. </p>
              <p> And she could not but respond with a smile - not to his words, 
                but to the love in his eyes. She took his hand and stroked her 
                chilled cheeks and cropped head with it. </p>
              <p> `I don't know you with this short hair. You've grown so pretty. 
                A boy. But how pale you are!' </p>
              <p> `Yes, I'm very weak,' she said, smiling. And her lips began 
                trembling again. </p>
              <p> `We'll go to Italy; you will get strong,' he said. </p>
              <p> `Can it be possible we could be like husband and wife, alone, 
                our own family?' she said, looking close into his eyes. </p>
              <p> `It only seems strange to me that it can ever have been otherwise.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Stiva says that he has agreed to everything, but I can't accept 
                his magnanimity,' she said, looking dreamily past Vronsky's face. 
                `I don't want a divorce; it's all the same to me now. Only I don't 
                know what he will decide about Seriozha.' </p>
              <p> He could not conceive how at this moment of their meeting she 
                could remember and think of her son, of divorce. What did it all 
                matter? </p>
              <p> `Don't speak of that, don't think of it,' he said, turning her 
                hand in his, and trying to draw her attention to him; but still 
                she did not look at him. </p>
              <p> `Oh, why didn't I die! It would have been better,' she said, 
                and, without sobbing, tears flowed down both her cheeks; but she 
                tried to smile, so as not to wound him. </p>
              <p> To decline the flattering and dangerous appointment at Tashkend 
                would have been, Vronsky had till then considered, disgraceful 
                and impossible. But now, without an instant's consideration, he 
                declined it, and observing dissatisfaction in the upper quarters 
                at this step, he immediately retired from the army. </p>
              <p> A month later Alexei Alexandrovich was left alone with his son 
                in his house at Peterburg, while Anna had gone abroad with Vronsky, 
                without having obtained a divorce, and having absolutely declined 
                all idea of one. </p>

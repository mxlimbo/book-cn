                Steps were heard at the door, and Princess Betsy, knowing it was 
                Madame Karenina, glanced at Vronsky. He was looking toward the 
                door, and his face wore a strange new expression. Joyfully, intently, 
                and at the same time timidly, he gazed at the approaching figure, 
                and slowly he rose to his feet. Anna walked into the drawing room. 
                Holding herself extremely erect, as always, looking straight before 
                her, and moving with her swift, resolute and light step, that 
                distinguished her walk from that of other society women, she crossed 
                the few paces that separated her from her hostess, shook hands 
                with her, smiled, and with the same smile looked around at Vronsky. 
                Vronsky bowed low and pushed a chair up for her. </p>
              <p>She acknowledged this only by a slight nod, flushed, and frowned. 
                But immediately, while rapidly greeting her acquaintances, and 
                shaking the hands proffered to her, she addressed Princess Betsy: 
              </p>
              <p> `I have been at Countess Lidia's, and meant to have come here 
                earlier, but I stayed on. Sir John was there. A most interesting 
                man.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, that's this missionary?' </p>
              <p> `Yes; he told us about life in India, most interestingly.' </p>
              <p> The conversation, interrupted by her coming in, flickered up 
                again like the light of a lamp being blown out. </p>
              <p> `Sir John! Yes, Sir John. I've seen him. He speaks well. Vlassieva 
                is altogether in love with him.' </p>
              <p> `And is it true that the younger Vlassieva is to marry Topov?' 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes - they say it's quite settled.' </p>
              <p> `I wonder at the parents! They say it's a marriage of passion.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Of passion? What antediluvian notions you have! Whoever talks 
                of passion nowadays?' said the ambassador's wife. </p>
              <p> `What would you do? This silly old fashion is still far from 
                dead,' said Vronsky. </p>
              <p> `So much the worse for those who keep up the fashion. The only 
                happy marriages I know are marriages of prudence.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, - but then, how often the happiness of these prudent marriages 
                is scattered like dust, precisely because that passion to which 
                recognition has been denied appears on the scene,' said Vronsky. 
              </p>
              <p> `But by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties 
                have sown their wild oats already. That's like scarlatina - one 
                has to go through with it and get it over with.' </p>
              <p> `In that case we must learn how to vaccinate for love, like 
                small-pox.' </p>
              <p> `I was in love in my young days - with a church clerk,' said 
                the Princess Miaghkaia. `I don't know that it did me any good.' 
              </p>
              <p> `No; I think - all jokes aside - that to know love, one must 
                first make a fault, and then mend it,' said Princess Betsy. </p>
              <p> `Even after marriage?' said the ambassador's wife playfully. 
              </p>
              <p> `It's never too late to mend,' the diplomatist repeated the 
                English proverb. </p>
              <p> `Just so,' Betsy agreed; `one must make a mistake and rectify 
                it. What do you think about it?' She turned to Anna, who, with 
                a barely perceptible resolute smile on her lips, was listening 
                to the conversation. </p>
              <p> `I think' said Anna, playing with the glove she had taken off, 
                `I think... if there are as many minds as there are heads, then 
                surely there must be as many kinds of love as there are hearts.' 
              </p>
              <p> Vronsky was gazing at Anna, and with a heart sinking was waiting 
                for what she would say. He sighed as after a danger escaped when 
                she had uttered these words. </p>
              <p> Anna suddenly turned to him. </p>
              <p> `Oh, I have had a letter from Moscow. They write me that Kitty 
                Shcherbatskaia's very ill.' </p>
              <p> `Really?' said Vronsky, knitting his brows. </p>
              <p> Anna looked sternly at him. </p>
              <p> `That doesn't interest you?' </p>
              <p> `On the contrary, it does - very much. What is it, exactly, 
                that they write you, if may know?' he asked. </p>
              <p> Anna got up and went to Betsy. </p>
              <p> `Give me a cup of tea,' she said, pausing behind her chair. 
              </p>
              <p> While Betsy was pouring out the tea, Vronsky walked up to Anna. 
              </p>
              <p> `What is it they write you?' he repeated. </p>
              <p> `I often think men have no understanding of what is dishonorable, 
                though they're forever talking of it,' said Anna, without answering 
                him. `I've wanted to tell you something for a long while,' she 
                added, and, moving a few steps away, she sat down at a corner 
                table which held albums. </p>
              <p> `I don't quite understand the significance of your words,' he 
                said, handing her the cup. </p>
              <p> She glanced towards the sofa beside her, and he instantly sat 
                down. </p>
              <p> `Yes, I've wanted to tell you,' she said, without looking at 
                him. `Your action was wrong - wrong, very wrong.' </p>
              <p> `Do you suppose I don't know that I've acted wrongly? But who 
                was the cause of my doing so?' </p>
              <p> `Why do you say that to me?' she said looking at him sternly. 
              </p>
              <p> `You know why,' he answered, boldly and joyously, meeting her 
                glance and without dropping his eyes. </p>
              <p> It was not he, but she, who became confused. </p>
              <p> `That merely proves you have no heart,' she said. But her eyes 
                said that she knew he had a heart, and that was why she was afraid 
                of him. </p>
              <p> `What you spoke of just now was a mistake, and not love.' </p>
              <p> `Remember that I have forbidden you to utter that word, that 
                detestable word,' said Anna, with a shudder. But at once she felt 
                that by that very word `forbidden' she had shown that she acknowledged 
                certain rights over him, and by that very fact was encouraging 
                him to speak of love. `I have long meant to tell you this,' she 
                went on, looking resolutely into his eyes, and all aflame from 
                the burning flush on her cheeks. `I've come here purposely this 
                evening, knowing I should meet you. I have come to tell you that 
                this must end. I have never blushed before anyone, and you force 
                me to feel guilty of something.' </p>
              <p> He looked at her and was struck by a new spiritual beauty in 
                her face. </p>
              <p> `What do you wish of me?' he said, simply and gravely. </p>
              <p> `I want you to go to Moscow and ask for Kitty's forgiveness,' 
                she said. </p>
              <p> `That is not your wish,' he said. </p>
              <p> He saw she was saying what she was forcing herself to say, not 
                what she wanted to say. </p>
              <p> `If you love me, as you say,' she whispered, `you will do this, 
                so that I may be at peace.' </p>
              <p> His face grew radiant. </p>
              <p> `Don't you know that you're all my life to me? But I know no 
                peace, and I can't give it to you; all of myself, and love - yes. 
                I can't think of you and myself apart. You and I are one to me. 
                And I see no possibility before us of peace - either for me or 
                for you. I see a possibility of despair, of wretchedness.... Or 
                else I see a possibility of happiness - and what a happiness!... 
                Can it be impossible?' he added, his lips barely moving - yet 
                she heard. </p>
              <p> She strained every effort of her mind to say what ought to be 
                said. But instead of that she let her eyes rest on him, full of 
                love, and made no answer. </p>
              <p> `It's come!' he thought in ecstasy. `When I was beginning to 
                despair, and it seemed there would be no end - it's come! She 
                loves me! She owns it!' </p>
              <p> `Then do this for me: never say such things to me, and let us 
                be friends,' she said in words; but her eyes spoke quite differently. 
              </p>
              <p> `Friends we shall never be - that you know yourself. Whether 
                we shall be the happiest or the most wretched of people - that 
                lies within your power.' </p>
              <p> She would have said something, but he interrupted her. </p>
              <p> `For I ask but one thing: I ask for the right to hope, to suffer 
                - even as I am doing now. But if even that cannot be, command 
                me to disappear, and I disappear. You shall not see me if my presence 
                is painful to you.' </p>
              <p> `I don't want to drive you away.' </p>
              <p> `Only don't change anything - leave everything as it is,' said 
                he, in a shaky voice. `Here's your husband.' </p>
              <p> At that instant Alexei Alexandrovich did in fact walk into the 
                room with his calm, ungainly gait. </p>
              <p> Glancing at his wife and Vronsky, he went up to the lady of 
                the house, and, sitting down for a cup of tea, began talking in 
                his unhasty, always audible voice, in his habitual tone of banter, 
                as if he were teasing someone. </p>
              <p> `Your Rambouillet is in full conclave,' he said looking round 
                at all the party; `the graces and the muses.' </p>
              <p> But Princess Betsy could not endure that tone of his - sneering, 
                as she called it, using the English word, and like a clever hostess 
                she at once brought him around to a serious conversation on the 
                subject of universal conscription. Alexei Alexandrovich was immediately 
                carried away by the subject, and began seriously defending the 
                new imperial decree before Princess Betsy, who had attacked it. 
              </p>
              <p> Vronsky and Anna still sat at the little table. </p>
              <p> `This is getting indecorous,' whispered one lady, with an expressive 
                glance at Madame Karenina, her husband and Vronsky. </p>
              <p> `What did I tell you?' said Anna's friend. </p>
              <p> But it was not only these ladies who watched them - almost everyone 
                in the room, even the Princess Miaghkaia and Betsy herself, looked 
                several times in the direction of the two who had withdrawn from 
                the general circle, as though they found it a hindrance. Alexei 
                Alexandrovich was the only person who did not once look in their 
                direction, and was not diverted from the interesting discussion 
                he had entered upon. </p>
              <p> Noticing the disagreeable impression that was being made on 
                everyone, Princess Betsy slipped someone else into her place to 
                listen to Alexei Alexandrovich, and walked over to Anna. </p>
              <p> `I'm always amazed at the clearness and precision of your husband's 
                language,' she said. `The most transcendent ideas seem to be within 
                my grasp when he's speaking.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes!' said Anna, radiant with a smile of happiness, and 
                not understanding a word of what Betsy had said. She crossed over 
                to the big table and took part in the general conversation. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich, after staying half an hour, walked up 
                to his wife and suggested that they go home together. But she 
                answered, without looking at him, that she was staying to supper. 
                Alexei Alexandrovich bowed himself out. </p>
              <p> The fat old Tatar, Madame Karenina's coachman, in a glistening 
                leather coat, was with difficulty bridling the left of her pair 
                of grays, chilled with the cold and rearing at the entrance. A 
                footman stood by the carriage door he had opened. The hall porter 
                stood holding open the great door of the house. Anna Arkadyevna, 
                with her quick little hand, was unfastening the lace of her sleeve, 
                caught in the hook of her fur cloak, and with bent head was listening 
                rapturously to the words Vronsky murmured as he saw her down to 
                her carriage. </p>
              <p> `You've said nothing, of course, and I ask nothing,' he was 
                saying; `but you know that friendship is not what I want: that 
                there's only one happiness in life for me - that word you dislike 
                so... yes, love!...' </p>
              <p> `Love...' she repeated slowly, in an inner voice, and suddenly, 
                at the very instant she unhooked the lace, she added, `I don't 
                like the word precisely because it means too much to me, far more 
                than you can understand,' and she glanced into his face. `Good-by.' 
              </p>
              <p> She gave him her hand, and with her rapid, springy step she 
                passed by the porter and vanished into the carriage. </p>
              <p> Her glance, the touch of her hand, had seared him. He kissed 
                the palm of his hand where she had touched it, and went home, 
                happy in the realization that he had got nearer to the attainment 
                of his aims that evening than during the two last months. </p>

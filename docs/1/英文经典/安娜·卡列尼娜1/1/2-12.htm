              <p> <br>
                In the early days, after his return from Moscow, whenever Levin 
                shuddered and grew red, remembering the disgrace of his rejection, 
                he would say to himself: `This was just how I used to shudder 
                and blush, thinking everything utterly lost, when I was flunked 
                in physics and did not get promoted; and this is also how I thought 
                myself utterly ruined after I had mismanaged that affair of my 
                sister's with which I had been entrusted. And yet, now that the 
                years have passed, I recall it and wonder that it could distress 
                me so much. It will be the same thing with this trouble as well. 
                Time will go by, and I shall not mind this either.' </p>
              <p>But three months had passed and he had not left off minding about 
                it; and it was as painful for him to think of it now as it had 
                been during those first days. He could not be at peace because, 
                after dreaming so long of family life, and feeling himself so 
                ripe for it, he was still not married, and was farther than ever 
                from marriage. He was painfully conscious himself, as were all 
                about him, that at his years it is not good that man should be 
                alone. He remembered how before starting for Moscow he had once 
                said to his cowherd Nicolai, a simplehearted peasant, to whom 
                he liked to talk: `Well, Nicolai! I mean to get married,' and 
                how Nicolai had promptly answered, as of a matter on which there 
                could be no possible doubt: `And high time too, Konstantin Dmitrich.' 
                But marriage had now become farther off than ever. The place was 
                taken, and whenever he tried to imagine any of the girls he knew 
                in that place, he felt that it was utterly impossible. Moreover, 
                the recollection of the rejection and the part he had played in 
                the affair tortured him with shame. However often he told himself 
                that he was in no wise to blame in it, that recollection, like 
                other similarly humiliating recollections, made him wince and 
                blush. There had been in his past, as in every man's, actions, 
                recognized by him as bad, for which his conscience ought to have 
                tormented him; but the recollection of these evil actions was 
                far from causing him as much suffering as these trivial but humiliating 
                recollections. These wounds never healed. And with these recollections 
                was now ranged his rejection and the sorry plight in which he 
                must have appeared to others that evening. Yet time and labor 
                were doing their work. Bitter recollections were more and more 
                being covered up by the incidents - inconspicuous ones, but important 
                - of his country life. Every week he thought less often of Kitty. 
                He was impatiently looking forward to the news that she was married, 
                or just going to be married, hoping that such news would, like 
                having a tooth out, completely cure him. </p>
              <p> Meanwhile spring came on, beautiful and kindly, without the 
                delays and treacheries incident to spring - one of those rare 
                springs in which plants, beasts and man rejoice alike. This lovely 
                spring roused Levin still more, and strengthened him in his resolution 
                of renouncing all his past and building up his lonely life firmly 
                and independently. Though many of the plans with which he had 
                returned to the country had not been carried out, his most important 
                resolution - that of purity of life - had nevertheless been kept 
                by him. He was free from that shame which had usually harassed 
                him after a fall; and he could look everyone straight in the face. 
                In February he had received a letter from Marya Nikolaevna telling 
                him that his brother Nikolai's health was getting worse, but that 
                he would not take advice, and in consequence of this letter Levin 
                went to Moscow to his brother's, and succeeded in persuading him 
                to see a doctor and to go to a watering place abroad. He succeeded 
                so well in persuading his brother, and in lending him money for 
                the journey without irritating him, that he was satisfied with 
                himself on that score. In addition to his farming, which called 
                for special attention in spring, in addition to reading Levin 
                had begun that winter a work on agriculture, the plan of which 
                turned on taking into account the character of the laborer on 
                the land as one of the unalterable data of the question, like 
                the climate and the soil, and consequently deducing all the principles 
                of scientific culture, not simply from the data of soil and climate, 
                but from the data of soil, climate and a certain unalterable character 
                of the laborer. Thus, in spite of his solitude, or in consequence 
                of his solitude, life was exceedingly full, save that, on rare 
                occasions, he suffered from an unsatisfied desire to communicate 
                his stray ideas to someone besides Agathya Mikhailovna. With her 
                indeed he not infrequently fell into discussions upon physics, 
                the theory of agriculture, and, especially, philosophy: philosophy 
                was Agathya Mikhailovna's favorite subject. </p>
              <p> Spring was slow in unfolding. For the last few weeks of Lent 
                it had been steadily fine and frosty weather. In the daytime there 
                was a thaw in the sun, but at night there were as many as seven 
                degrees of frost. The snow was so packed and frozen that loads 
                could be carried along anywhere, regardless of roads. Easter came 
                in snow. Then all of a sudden, on Easter Monday, a warm wind sprang 
                up, storm clouds swooped down, and for three days and three nights 
                the warm, tempestuous rain fell in torrents. On Thursday the wind 
                dropped, and a thick gray fog brooded over the land, as though 
                screening the mysteries of the transformations that were being 
                wrought in nature. Behind the fog there was the flowing of water, 
                the cracking and floating of ice, the swift rush of turbid, foaming 
                torrents; and on the following Monday, in the evening, the fog 
                parted, the storm clouds split up into little curling crests of 
                cloud, the sky cleared, and the real spring had come. In the morning 
                the sun arose brilliant and quickly wore away the thin layer of 
                ice that covered the water, and all the warm air was quivering 
                with the steam that rose up from the quickened earth. The old 
                grass looked greener, and the young grass thrust up its tiny blades; 
                the buds of the guelder-rose and of the currant, and the sticky 
                birch buds were swollen with sap, and an exploring bee was humming 
                about the golden blossoms that studded the willow. Larks trilled 
                unseen above the velvety green fields and the ice-covered stubble 
                land; pewits wailed over the lowlands and marshes, flooded by 
                the pools; cranes and wild geese flew high across the sky uttering 
                their spring calls. The cattle, bald in patches where the new 
                hair had not grown yet, lowed in the pastures; bowlegged lambs 
                frisked round their bleating dams, who were shedding their fleece; 
                nimble-footed children ran along the drying paths, covered with 
                the prints of bare feet; there was a merry chatter of peasant 
                women over their linen at the pond, and the ring of axes in the 
                yard, where the peasants were repairing plows and harrows. The 
                real spring had come. </p>

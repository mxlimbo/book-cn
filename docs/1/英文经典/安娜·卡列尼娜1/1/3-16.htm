              <p><br>
                All the rooms of the summer villa were full of porters, gardeners, 
                and footmen, going to and fro carrying out things. Cupboards and 
                chests were open; twice they had to run to a store for cord; pieces 
                of newspaper were cluttering the floor. Two trunks, some bags 
                and strapped-up plaids had been carried down into the hall. The 
                carriage and two hired cabs were waiting at the steps. Anna, forgetting 
                her inward agitation in the work of packing, was standing at a 
                table in her boudoir, packing her traveling bag, when Annushka 
                called her attention to the clatter of some carriage driving up. 
                Anna looked out of the window and saw Alexei Alexandrovich's messenger 
                on the steps, ringing at the front doorbell. </p>
              <p>`Run and find out what it is,' she said, and, with a calm sense 
                of being prepared for anything, she sat down in a low chair, folding 
                her hands on her knees. A footman brought in a thick packet directed 
                in Alexei Alexandrovich's hand. </p>
              <p> `The messenger has orders to wait for an answer,' he said. </p>
              <p> `Very well,' she said, and as soon as he had left the room she 
                tore open the letter with trembling fingers. A packet of unfolded 
                banknotes done up with a band fell out of it. She extricated the 
                letter and began reading it from the end. `Preparations shall 
                be made for your arrival here... I attach particular significance 
                to compliance....' she read. She ran through it backward, read 
                it all through, and once more read the letter all through again, 
                from the beginning. When she had finished, she felt that she was 
                cold all over, and that a fearful calamity, such as she had not 
                expected, had burst upon her. </p>
              <p> In the morning she had regretted that she had spoken to her 
                husband, and wished for nothing so much as that those words might 
                be unspoken. And here this letter regarded them as unspoken, and 
                gave her what she had wanted. But now this letter seemed to her 
                more awful than anything she had been able to conceive. </p>
              <p> `He's right!' she said. `Of course, he's always right; he's 
                a Christian, he's generous! Yes, vile, base creature! And no one 
                understands it except me, and no one ever will; and I can't explain 
                it. They say he's so religious, so high-principled, so upright, 
                so clever; but they don't see what I've seen. They don't know 
                how he has crushed my life for eight years, crushed everything 
                that was living in me - he has not once even thought that I'm 
                a live woman who must have love. They don't know how at every 
                step he's humiliated me, and been just as pleased with himself. 
                Haven't I striven - striven with all my strength - to find something 
                to give meaning to my life? Haven't I struggled to love him, to 
                love my son when I could not love my husband? But the time came 
                when I knew that I couldn't cheat myself any longer, that I was 
                alive, that I was not to blame, that God has made me so that I 
                must love and live. And now what does he do? If he'd killed me, 
                if he'd killed him, I could have borne anything, I could have 
                forgiven anything; but, no, he...' </p>
              <p> `How was it I didn't guess what he would do? He's doing just 
                what's natural to his mean character. He'll keep himself in the 
                right, while he'll drive me, in my ruin, still lower, still to 
                worse ruin...' </p>
              <p> `'You can conjecture what awaits you and your son,'' she recalled 
                a part of his letter. `That's a threat to take away my child, 
                and most likely according to their stupid law he can. But I know 
                very well why he says it. He doesn't believe even in my love for 
                my child, or he despises it (just as he always used to ridicule 
                it). He despises that feeling in me, but he knows that I won't 
                abandon my child, that I can't abandon my child, that there could 
                be no life for me without my child, even with him whom I love; 
                but that if I abandoned my child and ran away from him, I should 
                be acting like the most infamous, basest of women. He knows that, 
                and knows that I am incapable of doing that.' </p>
              <p> `Our life must go on as it has done in the past,' she recalled 
                another sentence in his letter. `That life was miserable enough 
                in the old days; it has been awful of late. What will it be now? 
                And he knows all that; he knows that I can't repent breathing, 
                repent loving; he knows that it can lead to nothing but lying 
                and deceit; but he wants to go on torturing me. I know him; I 
                know that he's at home and is happy in deceit, like a fish swimming 
                in the water. No, I won't give him that happiness. I'll break 
                through the spider's web of lies in which he wants to catch me, 
                come what may. Anything's better than lying and deceit.' </p>
              <p> `But how? My God! my God! Was ever a woman so miserable as I 
                am?...' </p>
              <p> `No; I will break through it, I will break through it!' she 
                cried, jumping up and keeping back her tears. And she went to 
                the writing table to write him another letter. But at the bottom 
                of her heart she felt that she was not strong enough to break 
                through anything, that she was not strong enough to get out of 
                her old position, however false and dishonorable it might be. 
              </p>
              <p> She sat down at the writing table, but instead of writing she 
                clasped her hands on the table, and, laying her head on them, 
                burst into tears, with sobs and heaving breast, like a child crying. 
                She was weeping because her dream of her position being made clear 
                and definite had been annihilated forever. She knew beforehand 
                that everything would go on in the old way, and far worse, indeed, 
                than in the old way. She felt that her position in the world she 
                enjoyed, and which had seemed to her of so little consequence 
                in the morning, was now precious to her, that she would not have 
                the strength to exchange it for the shameful position of a woman 
                who has abandoned husband and child to join her lover; that however 
                much she might struggle, she could not be stronger than herself. 
                She would never know freedom in love, but would remain forever 
                a guilty wife, with the menace of detection hanging over her at 
                every instant; deceiving her husband for the sake of a shameful 
                connection with a man living apart and away from her, whose life 
                she could never share. She knew that this was how it would be, 
                and at the same time it was so awful that she could not even conceive 
                what it would end in. And she cried without restraint, as children 
                cry when they are punished. </p>
              <p> The sound of a footman's steps forced her to rouse herself, 
                and, hiding her face from him, she pretended to be writing. </p>
              <p> `The messenger asks if there's any answer,' the footman informed 
                her. </p>
              <p> `Any answer? Yes,' said Anna. `Let him wait. I'll ring.' </p>
              <p> `What can I write?' she thought. `What can I decide upon alone? 
                What do I know? What do I want? What is there I care for?' Again 
                she felt that her soul was beginning to double. She was terrified 
                again at this feeling, and clutched at the first pretext for doing 
                something which might divert her thoughts from herself. `I ought 
                to see Alexei' (so she called Vronsky in her thoughts); `no one 
                but he can tell me what I ought to do. I'll go to Betsy's, perhaps 
                I shall see him there,' she said to herself, completely forgetting 
                that, when she had told him the day before that she was not going 
                to Princess Tverskaia's he had said that in that case he should 
                not go either. She went up to the table, wrote to her husband: 
                `I have received your letter. - A.'; and, ringing the bell, gave 
                it to the footman. </p>
              <p> `We are not going,' she said to Annushka, as she came in. </p>
              <p> `Not going at all?' </p>
              <p> `No; don't unpack till tomorrow, and let the carriage wait. 
                I'm going to the Princess.' </p>
              <p> `Which dress am I to get ready?' </p>
              <p></p>

              <p><br>
                Alexei Alexandrovich came back from the Ministry at four o'clock, 
                but as often happened, had no chance to drop in at her room. He 
                went into his study to see the people waiting for him with petitions, 
                and to sign certain papers brought him by his head clerk. At dinnertime 
                (there were always at least three people dining with the Karenins) 
                there arrived an old lady, a cousin of Alexei Alexandrovich; the 
                director of the Department and his wife; and a young man who had 
                been recommended to Alexei Alexandrovich for a post. Anna went 
                into the drawing room to entertain these guests. Precisely at 
                five o'clock, before the bronze Peter the First clock had finished 
                the fifth stroke, Alexei Alexandrovich made his entry, in white 
                tie and evening coat with two stars, as he had to go out directly 
                after dinner. Every minute of Alexei Alexandrovich's life was 
                taken up and apportioned. And in order to accomplish all that 
                each day held for him, he adhered to the strictest orderliness. 
                `Nor haste nor rest,' was his device. He entered the dining hall, 
                bowed to all, and hurriedly sat down, smiling to his wife: </p>
              <p>`Yes, my solitude is over. You wouldn't believe how uncomfortable 
                [he laid stress on the word uncomfortable] it is to dine alone.' 
              </p>
              <p> At dinner he chatted with his wife about things at Moscow, and 
                asked, with his mocking smile, about Stepan Arkadyevich; but the 
                conversation was for the most part general, dealing with the official 
                and public news of Peterburg. After dinner he spent half an hour 
                with his guests, and, again with a smile, pressed his wife's hand, 
                withdrew, and drove off to the Council. Anna went that evening 
                neither to the Princess Betsy Tverskaia, who, hearing of her return, 
                had invited her, nor to the theater, where she had a box for that 
                evening. Her principal reason for not going out was because the 
                dress she had expected to wear was not ready. All in all, Anna 
                was exceedingly annoyed when she started to dress for the evening 
                after the departure of her guests. Before her departure for Moscow 
                she, who was generally a mistress of the art of dressing well 
                yet inexpensively, had given her dressmaker three dresses to make 
                over. The dresses were to be made over so that their old selves 
                would be unrecognizable, and they should have been ready three 
                days ago. It turned out that two dresses were nowhere near ready, 
                while the other one had not been made over to Anna's liking. The 
                dressmaker came to explain, asserting that her way was best, and 
                Anna had become so heated that she blushed at the recollection. 
                To regain her composure fully she went into the nursery and spent 
                the whole evening with her son, putting him to bed herself, making 
                the sign of the cross over him, and tucking him in. She was glad 
                she had not gone out anywhere, and had spent the evening so well. 
                She felt so lighthearted and calm, she saw so clearly that all 
                that had seemed to her so significant on her railway journey was 
                merely one of the ordinary trivial incidents of fashionable life, 
                and that she had no cause to feel ashamed before anyone else or 
                before herself. Anna sat down near the fireplace with an English 
                novel and waited for her husband. Exactly at half-past nine she 
                heard his ring, and he entered the room. </p>
              <p> `Here you are at last!' she observed, extending her hand to 
                him. </p>
              <p> He kissed her hand and sat down beside her. </p>
              <p> `All in all, I can see your trip was a success,' he said to 
                her. </p>
              <p> `Yes, very much so,' said she, and she began telling him everything 
                from the beginning: her journey with Countess Vronskaia, her arrival, 
                the accident at the station. Then she described the pity she had 
                felt, first for her brother, and, afterward, for Dolly. </p>
              <p> `I do not suppose there is any excuse for such a man, even though 
                he is your brother,' said Alexei Alexandrovich sternly. </p>
              <p> Anna smiled. She knew that he said this precisely to show that 
                family considerations could not prevent him from expressing his 
                sincere opinion. She knew this trait in her husband and liked 
                it. </p>
              <p> `I am glad everything has ended so well, and that you have returned,' 
                he went on. `Well, and what do they say there about the new bill 
                I have got passed in the Council?' </p>
              <p> Anna had heard nothing of this bill, and she felt conscience-stricken 
                that she could so readily forget what was to him of such importance. 
              </p>
              <p> `Here, on the other hand, this has created a great deal of talk,' 
                said he, with a self-satisfied smile. </p>
              <p> She saw that Alexei Alexandrovich wanted to tell her something 
                that pleased him about it, and she brought him by questions to 
                telling it. With the same self-satisfied smile he told her of 
                the ovations he had received as a consequence of the bill he had 
                passed. </p>
              <p> `I was very, very happy. It shows that at last an intelligent 
                and firm view of the matter is forming among us.' </p>
              <p> After his second cup of tea, with cream and bread, Alexei Alexandrovich 
                got up, and went toward his study. </p>
              <p> `And you went nowhere this evening? Weren't You really bored?' 
                he said. </p>
              <p> `Oh, no!' she answered, getting up after him and accompanying 
                him across the room to his study. `What are you reading now?' 
                she asked. </p>
              <p> `Just now I'm reading Duc de Lille - Po√©sie des enfers,' he 
                answered. `A most remarkable book.' </p>
              <p> Anna smiled, as people smile at the weaknesses of those they 
                love, and, putting her hand in his, she kept him company to the 
                door of his study. She knew his habit, now become a necessity, 
                of reading in the evening. She knew, too, that in spite of his 
                official duties, which engrossed almost all his time, he deemed 
                it his duty to keep up with everything of note that appeared in 
                the intellectual sphere. She knew, too, that his actual interest 
                lay in books dealing with politics, philosophy and theology, that 
                art was utterly foreign to his nature; but, in spite of this - 
                or rather, in consequence of it - Alexei Alexandrovich never missed 
                anything which created a sensation in the world of art, but made 
                it his duty to read everything. She knew that in politics, in 
                philosophy, in theology, Alexei Alexandrovich was a doubter and 
                a seeker; yet in matters of art and poetry - and, above all, of 
                music, of which he was totally devoid of understanding - he had 
                the most definite and decided opinions. He was fond of discoursing 
                on Shakespeare, Raphael, Beethoven, on the significance of new 
                schools of poetry and music, all of which were classified by him 
                with most obvious consistency. </p>
              <p> `Well, God be with you,' she said at the door of the study, 
                where a shaded candle and a decanter of water were already placed 
                near his armchair. `As for me, I'm going to write to Moscow.' 
              </p>
              <p> He squeezed her hand, and again kissed it. </p>
              <p> `Still, he's a good man; truthful, kindhearted, and remarkable 
                in his own sphere,' Anna said to herself, back in her room, as 
                though defending him before someone who accused him, saying that 
                one could not love him. `But why is it his ears stick out so queerly? 
                Or has he had his hair cut?...' </p>
              <p> Exactly at twelve, as Anna was still sitting at her desk finishing 
                a letter to Dolly, she heard the sound of measured, slippered 
                steps, and Alexei Alexandrovich, washed and combed, a book under 
                his arm, approached her. </p>
              <p> `Come, come,' said he, with a particular smile, and passed on 
                into their bedroom. </p>
              <p> `And what right had he to look at him like that?' reflected 
                Anna, recalling how Vronsky had looked at Alexei Alexandrovich. 
              </p>
              <p> Having disrobed, she went into the bedroom; but her face had 
                none of the animation which, during her stay at Moscow, had fairly 
                spurted from her eyes and her smile; on the contrary, now the 
                fire seemed extinct in her, or hidden somewhere far away. </p>

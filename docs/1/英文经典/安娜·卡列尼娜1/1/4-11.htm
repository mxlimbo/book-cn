                Everyone took part in the conversation except Kitty and Levin. 
                At first, when they were talking of the influence that one people 
                has on another, there rose to Levin's mind what he had to say 
                on the subject. But these ideas, once of such importance in his 
                eyes, seemed to come into his brain as in a dream, and had now 
                not the slightest interest for him. It even struck him as strange 
                that they should be so eager to talk of what was of no use to 
                anyone. Kitty, too, one would have supposed, should have been 
                interested in what they were saying of the rights and education 
                of women. How often she had mused on the subject, thinking of 
                her friend abroad, Varenka, of her painful state of dependence; 
                how often she had wondered about herself as to what would become 
                of her if she did not marry, and how often she had argued with 
                her sister about it! But now it did not interest her at all. She 
                and Levin had a conversation of their own, yet not a conversation, 
                but a sort of mysterious communication, which brought them every 
                moment nearer, and stirred in both a sense of glad terror before 
                the unknown into which they were entering. <br>
                At first Levin, in answer to Kitty's question how he could have 
                seen her last year in the carriage, told her that he had been 
                coming home from the mowing along the highroad and had met her. 
              </p>
              <p> `It was very, very early in the morning. You were probably only 
                just awake. Your maman was asleep in her corner. It was an exquisite 
                morning. I was walking along wondering who it could be in the 
                four-in-hand. It was a splendid set of four horses with bells, 
                and in a second you flashed by, and I saw you at the window - 
                you were sitting, like this; holding the strings of your cap in 
                both hands, and in awfully deep thought about something,' he said, 
                smiling. `How I should like to know what you were thinking about 
                then! Something important?' </p>
              <p> `Wasn't I dreadfully untidy?' she wondered, but seeing the smile 
                of ecstasy these reminiscences called up, she felt that the impression 
                she had made had been very good. She blushed and laughed with 
                delight: </p>
              <p> `Really I don't remember.' </p>
              <p> `How nicely Turovtsin laughs!' said Levin, admiring his humid 
                eyes and heaving chest. </p>
              <p> `Have you known him long?' asked Kitty. </p>
              <p> `Oh, everyone knows him!' </p>
              <p> `And I see you think he's a horrid man?' </p>
              <p> `Not horrid, but there's nothing in him.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, you're wrong! And you must give up thinking so directly!' 
                said Kitty. `I used to have a very poor opinion of him too, but 
                he's an awfully fine and wonderfully goodhearted man. He has a 
                heart of gold.' </p>
              <p> `How could you find out what sort of heart he has?' </p>
              <p> `We are great friends. I know him very well. Last winter, soon 
                after... you came to see us,' she said, with a guilty and at the 
                same time a confiding smile, `all Dolly's children had scarlatina, 
                and he happened to come to see her. And only fancy,' she said 
                in a whisper, `he felt so sorry for her that he stayed and began 
                to help her look after the children. Yes, and for three weeks 
                he stopped with them, and looked after the children like a nurse.' 
              </p>
              <p> `I am telling Konstantin Dmitrievich about Turovtsin and the 
                scarlatina,' she said, bending over to her sister. </p>
              <p> `Yes, it was wonderful, noble!' said Dolly, glancing toward 
                Turovtsin, who had become aware they were talking of him, and 
                smiling gently to him. Levin glanced once more at Turovtsin, and 
                wondered how it was he had not realized all this man's goodness 
                before. </p>
              <p> `I'm sorry, I'm sorry, and I'll never think ill of people again!' 
                he said gaily, genuinely expressing what he felt at the moment.

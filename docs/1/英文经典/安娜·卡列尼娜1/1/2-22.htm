              <p><br>
                The shower did not last long, and by the time Vronsky arrived, 
                his shaft horse trotting at full speed, and dragging the off horses 
                galloping through the mud with their reins hanging loose, the 
                sun had peeped out again, the roofs of the summer villas and the 
                old lime trees in the gardens on both sides of the high street 
                sparkled with wet brilliance, and from the twigs came a pleasant 
                drip, and, from the roofs, rushing streams of water. He thought 
                no more of shower spoiling the racecourse, but was now rejoicing 
                because - thanks to the rain - he would be sure to find her at 
                home and alone, as he knew that Alexei Alexandrovich, who had 
                lately returned from a watering place, had not moved from Peterburg. 
              </p>
              <p>Hoping to find her alone, Vronsky alighted, as he always did, 
                to avoid attracting attention, before crossing the bridge, and 
                walked to the house. He did not go up the steps to the street 
                door, but went into the court. </p>
              <p> `Has your master come?' he asked a gardener. </p>
              <p> `No, sir. The mistress is at home. But will you please go to 
                the front door; there are servants there,' the gardener answered. 
                `They'll open the door.' </p>
              <p> `No, I'll go in from the garden.' </p>
              <p> And feeling satisfied that she was alone, and wanting to take 
                her by surprise, since he had not promised to be there today, 
                and she would certainly not expect him to come before the races, 
                he walked, holding his sword and stepping cautiously over the 
                sandy path, bordered with flowers, to the terrace that looked 
                out upon the garden. Vronsky forgot now all that he had thought 
                on the way of the hardships and difficulties of his position. 
                He thought of nothing but that he would see her directly, not 
                in imagination, but living, all of her, as she was in reality. 
                He was just going in, stepping on his whole foot so as not to 
                make a noise, up the worn steps of the terrace, when he suddenly 
                remembered what he always forgot, and what caused the most torturing 
                side of his relations with her: her son, with his questioning, 
                and, as he fancied, hostile eyes. </p>
              <p> This boy was more often than anyone else a check upon their 
                freedom. When he was present, both Vronsky and Anna did not merely 
                avoid speaking of anything that they could not have repeated before 
                everyone; they did not even allow themselves to refer by hints 
                to anything the boy did not understand. They had made no agreement 
                about this, it had been settled of itself. They would have felt 
                it as wounding themselves to deceive the child. In his presence 
                they talked like acquaintances. But, in spite of this caution, 
                Vronsky often saw the child's intent, bewildered glance fixed 
                upon him, and a strange shyness, uncertainty - at one time there 
                was friendliness, at another coldness and reserve, in the boy's 
                manner to him, as though the child felt that between this man 
                and his mother there existed some important bond, the significance 
                of which he could not understand. </p>
              <p> As a matter of fact the boy did feel that he could not understand 
                this relation, and he tried painfully, yet was unable, to make 
                clear to himself what feeling he ought to have for this man. With 
                a child's keen instinct for every manifestation of feeling he 
                saw distinctly that his father, his governess, his nurse - all 
                not merely disliked Vronsky, but looked on him with horror and 
                aversion, though they never said anything about him; while his 
                mother looked on him as her greatest friend. </p>
              <p> `What does it mean? Who is he? How ought I to love him? If I 
                don't know, it's my fault; either I'm stupid or a naughty boy,' 
                thought the child. And this was what caused his dubious, inquiring, 
                sometimes hostile expression, and the shyness and uncertainty 
                which Vronsky found so irksome. This child's presence always and 
                infallibly called up in Vronsky that strange feeling of inexplicable 
                loathing which he had experienced of late. This child's presence 
                called up both in Vronsky and in Anna a feeling akin to the feeling 
                of a sailor who sees by the compass that the direction in which 
                he is swiftly moving is far from the right one, but that to arrest 
                his motion is not in his power, that every instant is carrying 
                him farther and farther away, and that to admit to himself his 
                deviation from the right direction is tantamount to admitting 
                his certain ruin. </p>
              <p> This child, with his innocent outlook upon life, was the compass 
                that showed them the point at which they had departed from what 
                they knew, yet did not want to know. </p>
              <p> This time Seriozha was not at home, and she was completely alone. 
                She was sitting on the terrace waiting for the return of her son, 
                who had gone out for a stroll and had been caught in the rain. 
                She had sent out a manservant and a maid to look for him, and 
                was sitting here waiting for them. Dressed in a white gown, deeply 
                embroidered, she was sitting in a corner of the terrace behind 
                some flowers, and did not hear him. Bending her curly dark head, 
                she pressed her forehead against a cool watering pot that stood 
                on the parapet, and both her lovely hands, with the rings he knew 
                so well, clasped the pot. The beauty of her whole figure, her 
                head, her neck, her hands, struck Vronsky every time as something 
                new and unexpected. He stood still, gazing at her in ecstasy. 
                But, directly he would have made a step to come nearer to her, 
                she was aware of his presence, pushed away the watering pot, and 
                turned her flushed face toward him. </p>
              <p> `What's the matter? Are you unwell,' he said to her in French, 
                going up to her. He would have run to her, but remembering that 
                there might be outsiders, he looked round toward the balcony door, 
                and reddened, as he always reddened, feeling that he had to be 
                afraid and be on his guard. </p>
              <p> `No, I'm quite well,' she said, getting up and squeezing his 
                outstretched hand tightly. `I did not expect... thee.' </p>
              <p> `My God! what cold hands!' he said. </p>
              <p> `You startled me,' she said. `I'm alone, and expecting Seriozha; 
                he's out for a walk; they'll come from this direction.' </p>
              <p> But, in spite of her efforts to be calm, her lips were quivering. 
              </p>
              <p> `Forgive me for coming, but I couldn't pass the day without 
                seeing you,' he went on, speaking French, as he always did, to 
                avoid using the stiff Russian plural form, so impossibly frigid 
                between them, and the dangerously intimate singular. </p>
              <p> `Forgive - for what I'm so glad!' </p>
              <p> `But you're ill or worried,' he went on, without letting go 
                her hands and bending over her. `What were you thinking of?' </p>
              <p> `Always of the same thing.' she said, with a smile. </p>
              <p> She spoke the truth. If ever at any moment she had been asked 
                what she was thinking of, she could have answered truly: Of the 
                same thing, of her happiness and her unhappiness. She was thinking, 
                just when he came upon her, of this: Why was it, she wondered, 
                that to others, to Betsy for instance (she knew of her secret 
                connection with Tushkevich), all this was so easy, while to her 
                it was such torture? Today this thought gained special poignancy 
                from certain other considerations. She asked him about the races. 
                He answered her questions, and, seeing that she was agitated, 
                trying to calm her, he began telling her in the simplest tone 
                the details of his preparations for the races. </p>
              <p> `Shall I tell him, or not?' she thought, looking into his calm, 
                affable eyes. `He is so happy, so absorbed in his races that he 
                won't understand as he should; he won't understand all the significance 
                of this event to us.' </p>
              <p> `But you haven't told me what you were thinking of when I came 
                in,' he said, interrupting his narrative; `pray, tell me!' </p>
              <p> She did not answer, and, bending her head a little, she looked 
                inquiringly at him from under her brows, her eyes shining under 
                their long lashes. Her hand shook as it played with a leaf she 
                had picked. He saw it, and his face expressed that utter subjection, 
                that slavish devotion, which had done so much to win her. </p>
              <p> `I see something has happened. Do you suppose I can be at peace, 
                knowing you have a trouble I am not sharing? Tell me, for God's 
                sake!' he repeated imploringly. </p>
              <p> `Yes, I shan't be able to forgive him if he does not realize 
                all the significance of it. Better not tell; why put him to the 
                proof?' she thought, still staring at him in the same way, and 
                feeling that her hand that held the leaf was trembling more and 
                more. </p>
              <p> `For God's sake!' he repeated, taking her hand. </p>
              <p> `Shall I tell you?' </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes, yes...' </p>
              <p> `I am pregnant,' she said, softly and slowly. </p>
              <p> The leaf in her hand shook more violently, but she did not take 
                her eyes off him, watching how he would take it. He turned pale, 
                would have said something, but stopped; he dropped her hand, and 
                his head sank on his breast. `Yes, he realizes all the significance 
                of the fact,' she thought, and gratefully she pressed his hand. 
              </p>
              <p> But she was mistaken in thinking he realized the significance 
                of the news as she, a woman, realized it. On hearing it, he felt 
                come upon him with tenfold intensity that strange feeling of loathing 
                of someone. But, at the same time, he realized that the turning 
                point he had been longing for had come now; that it was impossible 
                to go on concealing things from her husband, and it was inevitable 
                in one way or another that they should soon put an end to their 
                unnatural position. But, besides that, her emotion physically 
                affected him in the same way. He looked at her with a look of 
                submissive tenderness, kissed her hand, got up, and, in silence, 
                paced up and down the terrace. </p>
              <p> `Yes,' he said, going up to her resolutely. `Neither you nor 
                I have looked on our relations as a passing amusement, and now 
                our fate is sealed. It is absolutely necessary to put an end' 
                - he looked round as he spoke - `to the deception in which we 
                are living.' </p>
              <p> `Put an end? Put an end how, Alexei?' she said softly. </p>
              <p> She was calmer now, and her face lighted up with a tender smile. 
              </p>
              <p> `Leave your husband and make our life one.' </p>
              <p> `It is one as it is,' she answered, scarcely audibly. </p>
              <p> `Yes, but completely, completely.' </p>
              <p> `But how, Alexei - tell me how?' she said in melancholy mockery 
                at the hopelessness of her own situation. `Is there any way out 
                of such a situation? Am I not the wife of my husband?' </p>
              <p> `There is a way out of every situation. We must take our stand,' 
                he said. `Anything's better than the situation in which you're 
                living. Of course, I see how you torture yourself over everything 
                - the world, and your son, and your husband.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, not over my husband,' she said, with a plain smile. `I 
                don't know him, I don't think of him. He doesn't exist.' </p>
              <p> `You're not speaking sincerely. I know you. You worry about 
                him too.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, he doesn't even know,' she said, and suddenly a hot flush 
                came over her face; her cheeks, her brow, her neck crimsoned, 
                and tears of shame came into her eyes. `But let us not even talk 
                of him.' </p>

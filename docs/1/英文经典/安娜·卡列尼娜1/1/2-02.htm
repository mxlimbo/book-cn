              <p><br>
                Right after the doctor Dolly arrived. She knew that the consultation 
                was scheduled for that day, and, despite the fact that she had 
                only recently gotten up from her lying-in (she had had another 
                little girl at the end of the winter), despite her having enough 
                trouble and cares of her own, she had left her breast baby and 
                an ailing girl to come and learn Kitty's fate, which was being 
                decided that day. </p>
              <p>`Well, what's what?' said she, entering into the drawing room, 
                without taking off her hat. `You're all in good spirits. That 
                means good news, then?' </p>
              <p> An attempt was made to tell her what the doctor had said, but 
                it proved that, even though the doctor had talked coherently and 
                long, it was utterly impossible to convey what he had said. The 
                only point of interest was that going abroad was definitely decided 
                upon. </p>
              <p> Dolly could not help sighing. Her dearest friend, her sister, 
                was going away. And her life was far from gay. Her relations with 
                Stepan Arkadyevich after their reconciliation had become humiliating. 
                The welding Anna had made proved not at all solid, and family 
                concord had broken down again at the same point. There was nothing 
                definite, but Stepan Arkadyevich was hardly ever at home; also, 
                there was hardly ever any money, and Dolly was constantly being 
                tortured by suspicions of infidelities, and by now she drove them 
                away from her, dreading the agony of jealousy she had already 
                experienced. The first explosion of jealousy, once lived through, 
                could never return, and even the discovery of infidelities could 
                never affect her now as it had the first time. Such a discovery 
                now would only mean breaking up her family habits, and she permitted 
                him to deceive her, despising him - and still more herself - for 
                this weakness. Besides this, the cares of her large family were 
                a constant torment to her: now the nursing of her breast baby 
                did not go well; now the nurse would leave, now (as at the present 
                time) one of the children would fall ill. </p>
              <p> `Well, how's everybody in your family?' asked her mother. </p>
              <p> `Ah, maman, we have enough trouble of our own. Lili has taken 
                ill, and I'm afraid it's scarlatina. I have come here now to find 
                out about Kitty, and then I shall shut myself up entirely, if 
                - God forbid - it really be scarlatina.' </p>
              <p> The old Prince too had come in from his study after the doctor's 
                departure, and, after offering his cheek to Dolly, and chatting 
                awhile with her, he turned to his wife: </p>
              <p> `What have you decided - are you going? Well, and what do you 
                want to do with me?' </p>
              <p> `I think you had better stay here, Alexandre,' said his wife. 
              </p>
              <p> `Just as you wish.' </p>
              <p> `Maman, why shouldn't father come with us?' said Kitty. `He'll 
                feel better, and so will we.' </p>
              <p> The old Prince got up and stroked Kitty's hair. She lifted her 
                head and looked at him with a forced smile. It always seemed to 
                her that he understood her better than anyone else in the family 
                did, though he spoke but little with her. Being the youngest, 
                she was her father's favorite, and she fancied that his love for 
                her gave him insight. When now her gaze met his blue, kindly eyes, 
                scrutinizing her intently, it seemed to her that he saw right 
                through her, and understood all the evil things that were at work 
                within her. Reddening, she was drawn toward him, expecting a kiss; 
                but he merely patted her hair and said: </p>
              <p> `These silly chignons! One can't as much as get near one's real 
                daughter, but simply stroke the hair of defunct females. Well 
                Dolinka,' he turned to his elder daughter, `what's your ace up 
                to now?' </p>
              <p> `Nothing, papa,' answered Dolly, who knew that this referred 
                to her husband. `He's always out; I hardly ever see him,' she 
                could not resist adding with a mocking smile. </p>
              <p> `Why, hasn't he gone into the country yet - about the sale of 
                the forest?' </p>
              <p> `No; he's still getting ready.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, that's it!' said the Prince. `And so I'm to be getting 
                ready, too? At your service,' he said to his wife, sitting down. 
                `And as for you, Katia,' he went on, addressing his younger daughter, 
                `you must wake up one fine day and say to yourself: Why, I'm quite 
                well, and merry, and I'm going out again with papa for an early 
                morning stroll in the frost. Eh?' </p>
              <p> What her father said seemed simple enough, yet at these words 
                Kitty grew confused and upset, like a criminal caught red-handed. 
                `Yes, he knows all, he understands all, and in these words he's 
                telling me that though I'm ashamed, I must live through my shame.' 
                She could not pluck up spirit enough to make any answer. She made 
                an attempt but suddenly burst into tears, and ran out of the room. 
              </p>
              <p> `See what comes of your jokes!' the Princess pounced on her 
                husband. `You're always...' she launched into her reproachful 
                speech. </p>
              <p> The Prince listened to the Princess's reproaches rather a long 
                while and kept silent, but his face grew more and more glowering. 
              </p>
              <p> `She's so much to be pitied, poor thing, so much to be pitied, 
                yet you don't feel how it pains her to hear the least hint as 
                to the cause of it all. Ah! to be so mistaken in people!' said 
                the Princess, and by the change in her tone both Dolly and the 
                Prince knew she meant Vronsky. `I don't know why there aren't 
                laws against such vile, dishonorable people.' </p>
              <p> `Ah, I oughtn't to listen to you!' said the Prince glumly, getting 
                up from his chair, as if to go, yet pausing in the doorway. `There 
                are laws, my dear, and since you've challenged me to it, I'll 
                tell you who's to blame for it all: you - you, you alone. Laws 
                against such young gallants have always existed, and still exist! 
                Yes, if there weren't anything that ought not to have been, I, 
                old as I am, would have called him out to the barrier, this swell. 
                Yes, and now go ahead and physic her, and call in these charlatans.' 
              </p>
              <p> The Prince, it seemed, had plenty more to say, but no sooner 
                had the Princess caught his tone than she subsided at once, and 
                became penitent, as was always the case in serious matters. </p>
              <p> `Alexandre, Alexandre,' she whispered, approaching him and bursting 
                into tears. </p>
              <p> As soon as she began to weep the Prince, too, calmed down. He 
                went up to her. </p>
              <p> `There, that's enough, that's enough! You feel badly too, I 
                know. Nothing can be done about it! It's not so very bad. God 
                is merciful... thanks...' he said, without knowing himself what 
                he was saying now, responding to the moist kiss of the Princess 
                that he felt on his hand. And the Prince went out of the room. 
              </p>
              <p> No sooner had Kitty gone out of the room, in tears, than Dolly, 
                with her motherly, domestic habit, had promptly perceived that 
                here a woman's work lay before her, and got ready for it. She 
                took off her hat, and, morally speaking, tucked up her sleeves 
                and got ready for action. While her mother was attacking her father, 
                she tried to restrain her mother, so far as daughterly reverence 
                would allow. During the Prince's outburst she was silent; she 
                felt ashamed for her mother and tender toward her father for so 
                quickly being kind again. But when her father left, she made ready 
                for what was most necessary - to go to Kitty and compose her. 
              </p>
              <p> `I've intended long since to tell you something, maman: did 
                you know that Levin meant to propose to Kitty when he was here 
                last? He told Stiva so.' </p>
              <p> `Well, what of it? I don't understand...' </p>
              <p> `Why, perhaps Kitty refused him?... Did she say nothing to you?' 
              </p>
              <p> `No, she said nothing to me either of the one or the other; 
                she's too proud. But I know it's all on account of this...' </p>
              <p> `Yes, but suppose she has refused Levin - and she wouldn't have 
                refused him if it hadn't been for the other, I know. And then, 
                this fellow has deceived her so horribly.' </p>
              <p> It was too frightful for the Princess to think how much at fault 
                she was before her daughter, and she grew angry. </p>
              <p> `Oh, now I really understand nothing! Nowadays everybody thinks 
                to live after his own way; a mother isn't told a thing, and then 
                you have...' </p>
              <p> `Maman, I'll go to her.' </p>
              <p> `Do. Am I forbidding you?' </p>

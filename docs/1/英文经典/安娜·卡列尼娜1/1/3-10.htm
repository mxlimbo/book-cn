                `Kitty writes to me that there's nothing she longs for so much 
                as quiet and solitude,' Dolly said after the silence that had 
                followed. </p>
              <p>`And how is she - better?' Levin asked in agitation. </p>
              <p> `Thank God, she's quite well again. I never believed her lungs 
                were affected.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, I'm very glad!' said Levin, and Dolly fancied she saw something 
                touching, helpless, in his face as he said this and looked silently 
                into her face. </p>
              <p> `Let me ask you, Konstantin Dmitrievich,' said Darya Alexandrovna, 
                smiling her kindly and rather mocking smile, `why are you angry 
                with Kitty?' </p>
              <p> `I? I'm not angry with her,' said Levin. </p>
              <p> `Yes, you are. Why was it you did not come to see us or them 
                when you were in Moscow?' </p>
              <p> `Darya Alexandrovna,' he said, blushing up to the roots of his 
                hair, `I wonder really that with your kind heart you don't feel 
                this. How it is you feel no pity for me, if nothing else, when 
                you know...' </p>
              <p> `What do I know?' </p>
              <p> `You know that I proposed and was refused,' said Levin, and 
                all the tenderness he had been feeling for Kitty a minute before 
                was replaced by a feeling of anger for the slight he had suffered. 
              </p>
              <p> `What makes you suppose I know?' </p>
              <p> `Because everybody knows it....' </p>
              <p> `That's just where you are mistaken; I did not know it, though 
                I had guessed it was so.' </p>
              <p> `Well, now you know it.' </p>
              <p> `All I knew was that something had happened that made her dreadfully 
                miserable, and that she begged me never to speak of it. And if 
                she would not tell me, she would certainly not speak of it to 
                anyone else. But what did pass between you? Tell me.' </p>
              <p> `I have told you.' </p>
              <p> `When was it?' </p>
              <p> `When I was at their house the last time.' </p>
              <p> `Do you know,' said Darya Alexandrovna, `I am awfully, awfully 
                sorry for her. You suffer only from pride....' </p>
              <p> `Perhaps so,' said Levin, `but...' </p>
              <p> She interrupted him. </p>
              <p> `But she, poor girl... I am awfully, awfully sorry for her. 
                Now I see it all.' </p>
              <p> `Well, Darya Alexandrovna, you must excuse me,' he said, getting 
                up. `Good-by, Darya Alexandrovna, till we meet again.' </p>
              <p> `No, wait a minute,' she said, clutching him by the sleeve. 
                `Wait a minute, sit down.' </p>
              <p> `Please, please, don't let us talk of this,' he said, sitting 
                down, and at the same time feeling rise up and stir within his 
                heart a hope he had believed to be buried. </p>
              <p> `If I did not like you,' she said, and tears came into her eyes; 
                `if I did not know you, as I do know you...' </p>
              <p> The feeling that had seemed dead revived more and more, rose 
                up and took possession of Levin's heart. </p>
              <p> `Yes, I understand it all now,' said Darya Alexandrovna. `You 
                can't understand it; for you men, who are free and make your own 
                choice, it's always clear whom you love. But a girl's in a position 
                of suspense, with all a woman's or maiden's modesty, a girl who 
                sees you men from afar, who takes everything on trust - a girl 
                may have, and often has, such a feeling that she cannot tell what 
                to say.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, if the heart does not speak....' </p>
              <p> `No, the heart does speak; but just consider: you men have views 
                about a girl, you come to the house, you make friends, you criticize, 
                you wait to see if you have found what you love, and then, when 
                you are sure you love her, you propose...' </p>
              <p> `Well, that's not quite it.' </p>
              <p> `Anyway you propose, when your love is ripe, or when the balance 
                has completely turned between the two you are choosing from. But 
                a girl is not asked. She is expected to make her choice, and yet 
                she cannot choose - she can only answer ``yes' or ``no.'' </p>
              <p> `Yes, to choose between me and Vronsky,' thought Levin, and 
                the dead thing that had come to life within him died again, and 
                only weighed on his heart and set it aching. </p>
              <p> `Darya Alexandrovna,' he said, `that's how one chooses a new 
                dress, or some purchase or other - not love. The choice has been 
                made, and so much the better.... And there can be no repetition.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Ah, pride, pride!' said Darya Alexandrovna, as though despising 
                him for the baseness of this feeling in comparison with that other 
                feeling which only women know. `At the time when you proposed 
                to Kitty she was just in a position in which she could not answer. 
                She was in doubt. Doubt between you and Vronsky. Him she was seeing 
                every day, and you she had not seen for a long while. Supposing 
                she had been older... I, for instance, in her place, could have 
                felt no doubt. I always disliked him, and my dislike proved to 
                be justified.' </p>
              <p> Levin recalled Kitty's answer. She had said: `No, that cannot 
                be....' </p>
              <p> `Darya Alexandrovna,' he said dryly, `I appreciate your confidence 
                in me; I believe you are making a mistake. But whether I am right 
                or wrong, that pride you so despise makes any thought of Katerina 
                Alexandrovna out of the question for me; you understand - utterly 
                out of the question.' </p>
              <p> `I will only say one thing more: you know that I am speaking 
                of my sister, whom I love as I love my own children. I don't say 
                she cared for you; all I meant to say is that her refusal at that 
                moment proves nothing.' </p>
              <p> `I don't know!' said Levin, jumping up. `you only knew how you 
                are hurting me. It's just as if a child of yours were dead, and 
                they were to say to you: He would have been like this and like 
                that, and he might have lived, and how happy you would have been 
                in him. But he's dead, dead, dead!...' </p>
              <p> `How absurd you are!' said Darya Alexandrovna, looking with 
                mournful tenderness at Levin's excitement. `Yes, I see it all 
                more and more clearly,' she went on musingly. `So you won't come 
                to see us, then, when Kitty's here?' </p>
              <p> `No, I shan't come. Of course I won't avoid meeting Katerina 
                Alexandrovna; but, as far as I can, I will try to save her the 
                annoyance of my presence.' </p>
              <p> `You are very, very absurd,' repeated Darya Alexandrovna, looking 
                with tenderness into his face. `Very well then, let it be as though 
                we had not spoken of this. What have you come for, Tania?' she 
                said in French to the little girl who had come in. </p>
              <p> `Where's my spade, mamma?' </p>
              <p> `I speak French, and you must too.' </p>
              <p> The little girl tried to say it in French, but could not remember 
                the French for spade; the mother prompted her, and then told her 
                in French where to look for the spade. And this made a disagreeable 
                impression on Levin. </p>
              <p> Everything in Darya Alexandrovna's house and children struck 
                him now as by no means so charming as a little while before. </p>
              <p> `And why does she talk French with the children?' he thought. 
                `How unnatural and false it is! And the children feel it so: Learning 
                French and unlearning sincerity,' he thought to himself, unaware 
                that Darya Alexandrovna had thought all that over twenty times 
                already, and yet, even at the cost of some loss of sincerity, 
                believed it necessary to teach her children French in that way. 
              </p>
              <p> `But why are you going? Do stay a little.' </p>
              <p> Levin stayed to tea; but his good humor had vanished, and he 
                felt ill at ease. </p>
              <p> After tea he went out into the hall to order his horses to be 
                put in, and, when he came back, he found Darya Alexandrovna greatly 
                disturbed, with a troubled face, and tears in her eyes. While 
                Levin had been outside, an incident had occurred which had all 
                at once shattered all the happiness she had been feeling that 
                day, and her pride in her children. Grisha and Tania had been 
                fighting over a ball. Darya Alexandrovna, hearing a scream in 
                the nursery, ran in and saw a terrible sight. Tania was pulling 
                Grisha's hair, while he, with a face hideous with rage, was beating 
                her with his fists wherever he could get at her. Something snapped 
                in Darya Alexandrovna's heart when she saw this. It was as if 
                darkness had swooped down upon her life; she felt that these children 
                of hers, that she was so proud of, were not merely most ordinary, 
                but positively bad, ill-bred children, with coarse, brutal propensities 
                - wicked children. </p>
              <p> She could not talk or think of anything else, and she could 
                not help speaking to Levin of her misery. </p>
              <p> Levin saw she was unhappy and tried to comfort her, saying that 
                it showed nothing bad, that all children fight; but, even as he 
                said it, he was thinking in his heart: `No, I won't be artificial 
                and talk French with my children; but my children won't be like 
                that. All one has to do is not spoil children, not to distort 
                their nature, and they'll be delightful. No, my children won't 
                be like that.' </p>
              <p> He said good-by and drove away, and she did not try to detain 
                him. </p>

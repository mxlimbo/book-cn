                From that time a new life began for Alexei Alexandrovich and for 
                his wife. Nothing special happened. Anna went out into society, 
                as she had always done, was particularly often at Princess Betsy's, 
                and met Vronsky everywhere. Alexei Alexandrovich saw this, but 
                was powerless to do anything. All his efforts to draw her into 
                open discussion she confronted with a barrier which he could not 
                penetrate, made up of a sort of amused perplexity. Outwardly everything 
                was the same, but their inner relations were completely changed. 
                Alexei Alexandrovich, a man of great power in the world of politics, 
                felt himself helpless in this matter. Like an ox with head bent 
                submissively, he waited the fall of the poleax which he felt was 
                lifted over him. Every time he began to think about it, he felt 
                that he must try once more; that by kindness, tenderness and persuasion 
                there was still hope of saving her, of bringing her back to herself, 
                and every day he was on the verge of talking to her. But every 
                time he began he felt that the spirit of evil and deceit, which 
                had taken possession of her, had possession of him too, and he 
                talked to her in a tone quite unlike that which he had meant to 
                use. Involuntarily he talked to her in his habitual tone of bantering 
                at anyone who should say what he was saying. And in that tone 
                it was impossible to say to her what the occasion demanded.</p>

              <p><br>
                In the little German watering place to which the Shcherbatskys 
                had betaken themselves, as in all places indeed where people are 
                gathered together, the usual process, as it were, of the crystallization 
                of society went on, assigning to each member of that society a 
                definite and unalterable place. Just as the particle of water 
                in frost, definitely and unalterably, takes the special form of 
                the crystal of snow, so each new person that arrived at the springs 
                was at once placed in his or her peculiar place. </p>
              <p>Fürst Shcherbatsky, samt Gemahlin und Tochter, by the apartments 
                they took, and from their name and from the friends they made, 
                were immediately crystallized into a definite place marked out 
                for them. </p>
              <p> There was visiting the watering place that year a real German 
                Fürstin, in consequence of which the crystallizing process went 
                on more vigorously than ever. Princess Shcherbatsky wished, above 
                everything, to present her daughter to this German Princess, and 
                the day after their arrival she duly performed this rite. Kitty 
                made a low and graceful curtsy in the `very simple,' that is to 
                say, very elegant frock that had been ordered for her from Paris. 
                The German Princess said, `I hope the roses will soon come back 
                to this pretty little face,' and for the Shcherbatskyg certain 
                definite lines of existence were at once laid down, from which 
                there was no departing. The Shcherbatskys made the acquaintance 
                too of the family of an English lady, and of a German Countess 
                and her son, wounded in the last war, and of a learned Swede, 
                and of M. Canut and his sister. Yet inevitably the Shcherbatskys 
                were thrown most into the society of a Moscow lady, Marya Eugenyevna 
                Rtishcheva and her daughter, whom Kitty disliked, because she 
                had fallen ill, like herself, over a love affair; and a Moscow 
                colonel, whom Kitty had known from childhood, and had always seen 
                in uniform and epaulets, and who now, with his little eyes and 
                his open neck and flowered cravat, was uncommonly ridiculous and 
                tedious, because there was no getting rid of him. When all this 
                was so firmly established, Kitty began to be very much bored, 
                especially as the Prince went off to Carlsbad and she was left 
                alone with her mother. She took no interest in the people she 
                knew, feeling that nothing fresh would come of them. Her chief 
                mental interest in the watering place consisted in watching and 
                making theories about the people she did not know. It was characteristic 
                of Kitty that she always imagined everything in people in the 
                most favorable light possible, especially so in those she did 
                not know. And now, as she made surmises as to who people were, 
                what were their relations to one another, and what they were like, 
                Kitty endowed them with the most marvelous and noble characters, 
                and found confirmation in her observations. </p>
              <p> Of these people the one that attracted her most was a Russian 
                girl who had come to the watering place with an invalid Russian 
                lady, Madame Stahl, as everyone called her. Madame Stahl belonged 
                to the highest society, but she was so ill that she could not 
                walk, and only on exceptionally fine days made her appearance 
                at the springs in an invalid carriage. But it was not so much 
                from ill-health as from pride - so Princess Shcherbatskaia interpreted 
                it - that Madame Stahl had not made the acquaintance of anyone 
                among the Russians there. The Russian girl looked after Madame 
                Stahl, and besides that, she was, as Kitty observed, on friendly 
                terms with all the invalids who were seriously ill - and there 
                were many of them at the springs - and was solicitous over them 
                in the most natural way. This Russian girl was not, as Kitty gathered, 
                related to Madame Stahl, nor was she a paid attendant. Madame 
                Stahl called her Varenka, and other people called her `Mademoiselle 
                Varenka.' Apart from the interest Kitty took in this girl's relations 
                with Madame Stahl and with other unknown persons, Kitty, as often 
                happened, felt an inexplicable attraction to Mademoiselle Varenka, 
                and was aware when their eyes met that she too liked her. </p>
              <p> Of Mademoiselle Varenka one would not say that she had passed 
                her first youth, but she was, as it were, a creature without youth; 
                she might have been taken for nineteen or for thirty. If her features 
                were criticized separately, she was handsome rather that plain, 
                in spite of the sickly hue of her face. Hers would have been a 
                good figure, too, if it had not been for her extreme thinness 
                and the size of her head, which was too large for her medium height. 
                But she was not likely to be attractive to men. She was like a 
                fine flower, already past its bloom and without fragrance, though 
                the petals were still unwithered. Moreover, she would have been 
                unattractive to men also from the lack of just what Kitty had 
                too much of - of the suppressed fire of vitality, and the consciousness 
                of her own attractiveness. </p>
              <p> She always seemed absorbed in work, beyond a doubt, and so it 
                seemed as if she could take no interest in anything outside it. 
                It was just this contrast with her own position that was for Kitty 
                the great attraction of Mademoiselle Varenka. Kitty felt that 
                in her, in her manner of life, she would find an example of what 
                she was now so painfully seeking: interest in life, a dignity 
                in life - apart from the worldly relations of girls with men, 
                which so revolted Kitty, and appeared to her now as a shameful 
                exhibition of goods in search of a purchaser. The more attentively 
                Kitty watched her unknown friend, the more convinced she was that 
                this girl was the perfect creature she fancied her, and the more 
                eagerly she wished to make her acquaintance. </p>
              <p> The two girls used to meet several times a day, and every time 
                they met Kitty's eyes said: `Who are you? What are you? Are you 
                really the exquisite creature I imagine you to be? But for goodness' 
                sake don't suppose,' her eyes added, `that I would force my acquaintance 
                on you - I simply admire you and like you.' `I like you too, and 
                you're very, very sweet. And I should like you better still, if 
                I had time,' answered the eyes of the unknown girl. Kitty saw, 
                indeed, that she was always busy. Either she was taking the children 
                of a Russian family home from the springs, or fetching a shawl 
                for a sick lady, and wrapping her up in it, or trying to interest 
                an irritable invalid, or selecting and buying teacakes for someone. 
              </p>
              <p> Soon after the arrival of the Shcherbatskys there appeared in 
                the morning crowd at the springs two persons who attracted universal 
                and unfavorable attention. These were a tall man with a stooping 
                figure and huge hands, in an old coat too short for him, with 
                black, simple, and yet terrible eyes, and a pock-marked, kind-looking 
                woman, very badly and tastelessly dressed. Recognizing these persons 
                as Russians, Kitty had already in her imagination begun constructing 
                a delightful and touching romance about them. But the Princess, 
                having ascertained from the Kurliste that this was Nikolai Levin 
                and Marya Nikolaevna, explained to Kitty what a bad man this Levin 
                was, and all her fancies about these two people vanished. Not 
                so much from what her mother told her, as from the fact that it 
                was Konstantin's brother, this pair suddenly seemed to Kitty in 
                the highest degree unpleasant. This Levin, with his continual 
                twitching of his head, aroused in her now an irrepressible feeling 
                of disgust. </p>
              <p> It seemed to her that his big, terrible eyes, which persistently 
                pursued her, expressed a feeling of hatred and contempt, and she 
                tried to avoid meeting him. </p>

                When Levin went into the restaurant with Oblonsky, he could not 
                help noticing a certain peculiarity of expression, as it were, 
                a restrained radiance, about the face and whole figure of Stepan 
                Arkadyevich. Oblonsky took off his overcoat, and with his hat 
                over one ear walked into the dining room, giving directions to 
                the Tatar waiters, who were clustered about him in evening coats, 
                and with napkins under their arms. Bowing right and left to acquaintances 
                who, here as everywhere, greeted him joyously, he went up to the 
                bar, took a little wineglass of vodka and a snack of fish, and 
                said to the painted Frenchwoman decked in ribbons, lace and ringlets, 
                behind the desk, something so amusing that even that Frenchwoman 
                was moved to genuine laughter. Levin for his part refrained from 
                taking any vodka only because he found most offensive this Frenchwoman, 
                all made up, it seemed, of false hair, poudre de riz and vinaigre 
                de toilette. He made haste to move away from her, as from a dirty 
                place. His whole soul was filled with memories of Kitty, and there 
                was a smile of triumph and happiness shining in his eyes. </p>
              <p>`This way, Your Excellency, please. Your Excellency won't be 
                disturbed here,' said a particularly pertinacious, white-headed 
                old Tatar with immense hips and coattails gaping widely behind. 
                `Walk in, your Excellency,' he said to Levin - being attentive 
                to his guest as well, by way of showing his respect to Stepan 
                Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> Instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under 
                the bronze sconce, though it already had a tablecloth on it, he 
                pushed up velvet chairs and came to a standstill before Stepan 
                Arkadyevich with a napkin and a bill of fare in his hands, awaiting 
                his commands. </p>
              <p> `If you prefer it, Your Excellency, a private room will be free 
                directly: Prince Golitsin with a lady. Fresh oysters have come 
                in.' </p>
              <p> `Ah, oysters!' Stepan Arkadyevich became thoughtful. </p>
              <p> `How if we were to change our program, Levin?' he said, keeping 
                his finger on the bill of fare. And his face expressed serious 
                hesitation. `Are the oysters good? Mind, now!' </p>
              <p> `They're Flensburg, Your Excellency. We've no Ostend.' </p>
              <p> `Flensburg will do - but are they fresh?' </p>
              <p> `Only arrived yesterday.' </p>
              <p> `Well, then, how if we were to begin with oysters, and so change 
                the whole program? Eh?' </p>
              <p> `It's all the same to me. I should like cabbage soup and porridge 
                better than anything; but of course there's nothing like that 
                here.' </p>
              <p> `Porridge à la Russe, Your Honor would like?' said the Tatar, 
                bending down to Levin, like a nurse speaking to a child. </p>
              <p> `No, joking apart, whatever you choose is sure to be good. I've 
                been skating, and I'm hungry. And don't imagine,' he added, detecting 
                a look of dissatisfaction on Oblonsky's face, `that I shan't appreciate 
                your choice. I don't object to a good dinner.' </p>
              <p> `I should hope so! After all, it's one of the pleasures of life,' 
                said Stepan Arkadyevich. `Well, then, my friend, you give us two 
                - or better say three - dozen oysters, clear soup with vegetables...' 
              </p>
              <p> `Printaniere,' prompted the Tatar. But Stepan Arkadyevich apparently 
                did not care to allow him the satisfaction of giving the French 
                names of the dishes. </p>
              <p> `With vegetables in it, you know. Then turbot with thick sauce, 
                then... roast beef; and mind it's good. Yes, and capons, perhaps, 
                and then stewed fruit.' </p>
              <p> The Tatar, recollecting that it was Stepan Arkadyevich's way 
                not to call the dishes by the names in the French bill of fare, 
                did not repeat them after him, but could not resist rehearsing 
                the whole menu to himself according to the bill: `Soupe printaniere, 
                turbot sauce Beaumarchais, poulard à l'estragon, Macédoine de 
                fruits...' and then instantly, as though worked by springs, laying 
                down one bound bill of fare, he took up another, the list of wines, 
                and submitted it to Stepan Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> `What shall we drink?' </p>
              <p> `What you like, only not too much. Champagne,' said Levin. </p>
              <p> `What! to start with? You're right though, I dare say. Do you 
                like the white seal?' </p>
              <p> `Cachet blanc,' prompted the Tatar. </p>
              <p> `Very well, then, give us that brand with the oysters, and then 
                we'll see.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, sir. And what table wine?' </p>
              <p> `You can give us Nuits. Oh, no - better the classic Chablis.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, sir. And your cheese, Your Excellency?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes, Parmesan. Or would you like another?' </p>
              <p> `No, it's all the same to me,' said Levin, unable to suppress 
                a smile. </p>
              <p> And the Tatar ran off with flying coattails, and in five minutes 
                darted in with a dish of opened oysters in their nacreous shells, 
                and a bottle between his fingers. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich crushed the starchy napkin, tucked it into 
                his waistcoat, and, settling his arms comfortably, started on 
                the oysters. </p>
              <p> `Not bad,' he said, detaching the jellied oysters from their 
                pearly shells with a small silver fork, and swallowing them one 
                after another. `Not bad,' he repeated, turning his dewy, brilliant 
                eyes now upon Levin, now upon the Tatar. </p>
              <p> Levin ate the oysters too, though white bread and cheese pleased 
                him better. But he was admiring Oblonsky. Even the Tatar, uncorking 
                the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate funnel-shaped 
                glasses, and adjusting his white cravat, kept on glancing at Stepan 
                Arkadyevich with a perceptible smile of satisfaction. </p>
              <p> `You don't care much for oysters, do you?' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                emptying his wineglass, `or are you worried about something. Eh?' 
              </p>
              <p> He wanted Levin to be in good spirits. But it was not that Levin 
                was not in good spirits, he was ill at ease. With what he had 
                in his soul, he felt hard and awkward in the restaurant, in the 
                midst of private rooms where men were dining with ladies, in all 
                this fuss and bustle; the surroundings of bronzes, looking glasses, 
                gas and Tatars - all of this was offensive to him. He was afraid 
                of sullying what his soul was brimful of. </p>
              <p> `I? Yes, I am worried; but besides that, all this bothers me,' 
                he said. `You can't conceive how queer it all seems to a countryman 
                like me, as queer as that gentleman's nails I saw at your office....' 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, I saw how much interested you were in poor Grinevich's 
                nails,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, laughing. </p>
              <p> `It's too much for me,' responded Levin. `Do try, now, to put 
                yourself in my place - take the point of view of a countryman. 
                We in the country try to bring our hands into such a state as 
                will be most convenient for working with. So we cut our nails; 
                sometimes we tuck up our sleeves. And here people purposely let 
                their nails grow as long as possible, and link on small saucers 
                by way of studs, so that they can do nothing with their hands.' 
              </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich smiled gaily. </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes, that's just a sign that he has no need to do coarse 
                work. His work is with the mind....' </p>
              <p> `Maybe. But still it's queer to me, just as at this moment it 
                seems queer to me that we countryfolks try to satiate ourselves 
                as soon as we can, so as to be ready for work, while here are 
                we trying to delay satiety as long as possible, and with that 
                object are eating oysters....' </p>
              <p> `Why, of course,' objected Stepan Arkadyevich. `But that's just 
                the aim of culture - to make everything a source of enjoyment.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, if that's its aim, I'd rather be a savage.' </p>
              <p> `You are a savage, as it is. All you Levins are savages.' </p>
              <p> Levin sighed. He remembered his brother Nikolai, and felt ashamed 
                and pained, and he scowled; but Oblonsky began speaking of a subject 
                which at once drew his attention. </p>
              <p> `Oh, I say, are you going tonight to our people - the Shcherbatsky's, 
                I mean?' he said, his eyes sparkling significantly as he pushed 
                away the empty rough shells, and drew the cheese toward him. </p>
              <p> `Yes, I shall certainly go,' replied Levin; `though I fancied 
                the Princess was not very warm in her invitation.' </p>
              <p> `What nonsense! That's her manner.... Come, boy, the soup!... 
                That's her manner - grande dame,' said Stepan Arkadyevich. `I'm 
                coming, too, but I have to go to the Countess Bonin's rehearsal. 
                Come, isn't it true that you're a savage? How do you explain the 
                sudden way in which you vanished from Moscow? The Shcherbatskys 
                were continually asking me about you, as though I ought to know. 
                The only thing I know is that you always do what no one else does.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes,' said Levin, slowly and with emotion, `you're right. I 
                am a savage. Only, my savageness is not in having gone away, but 
                in coming now. Now I have come...' </p>
              <p> `Oh, what a lucky fellow you are!' broke in Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                looking into Levin's eyes. </p>
              <p> `Why?' </p>
              <p> `I can tell the gallant steeds,' by some... I don't know what... 
                ``pace's; I can tell youths ``by their faces,''' declaimed Stepan 
                Arkadyevich. `Everything is before you.' </p>
              <p> `Why, is it over for you already?' </p>
              <p> `No; not over exactly, but the future is yours, and the present 
                is mine, and the present - well, it's only fair to middling.' 
              </p>
              <p> `How so?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, things aren't right. But I don't want to talk of myself, 
                besides I can't explain it all,' said Stepan Arkadyevich. `Well, 
                why have you come to Moscow, then?... Hi! clear the table!' he 
                called to the Tatar. </p>
              <p> `Are you trying to surmise?' responded Levin, his eyes, gleaming 
                in their depth, fixed on Stepan Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> `I am, but I can't be the first to talk about it. You can see 
                by that whether I surmise right or wrong,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                gazing at Levin with a subtle smile. </p>
              <p> `Well, and what have you to say to me?' said Levin in a quivering 
                voice, feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering 
                too. `How do you look at it? </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich slowly emptied his glass of Chablis, never 
                taking his eyes off Levin. </p>
              <p> `I?' said Stepan Arkadyevich. `There's nothing I desire so much 
                as that - nothing! It would be the best thing that could happen.' 
              </p>
              <p> `But you're not making a mistake? You know what we're speaking 
                of?' said Levin, piercing him with his eyes. `You think it's possible?' 
              </p>
              <p> `I think it's possible. Why not?' </p>
              <p> `No! Do you really think it's possible? No - tell me all you 
                think! Oh, but if... If refusal's in store for me!... Indeed I 
                feel sure...' </p>
              <p> `What makes you think so?' said Stepan Arkadyevich, smiling 
                at his excitement. </p>
              <p> `It seems so to me sometimes. That will be awful for me, and 
                for her too.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, well, anyway there's nothing awful in it for a girl. Every 
                girl's proud of a proposal.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, every girl, but not she.' </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich smiled. He so well knew that feeling of Levin's, 
                that for him all the girls in the world were divided into two 
                classes: one class - all the girls in the world except her, and 
                those girls with all sorts of human failings, and very ordinary 
                girls: the other class - she alone, having no failings of any 
                sort and higher than all humanity. </p>
              <p> `Stay, take some sauce,' he said, holding back Levin's hand, 
                who was pushing the sauce away. </p>
              <p> Levin obediently helped himself to sauce, but would not let 
                Stepan Arkadyevich go on with his dinner. </p>
              <p> `No, stop a minute, stop a minute,' he said. `You must understand 
                that it's a question of life and death for me. I have never spoken 
                to anyone of this. And there's no one to whom I could speak of 
                it, except yourself. You know we're utterly unlike each other, 
                different in tastes, and views, and everything; but I know you're 
                fond of me and understand me, and that's why I like you awfully. 
                But for God's sake, be quite straightforward with me.' </p>
              <p> `I tell you what I think,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, smiling. 
                `But I'll say more: my wife is a wonderful woman...' Stepan Arkadyevich 
                sighed, recalling his relations with his wife, and, after a moment's 
                silence, resumed - `She has a gift of foreseeing things. She sees 
                right through people; but that's not all; she knows what will 
                come to pass, especially in the way of marriages. She foretold, 
                for instance, that Princess Shahovskaia would marry Brenteln. 
                No one would believe it, but it came to pass. And she's on your 
                side.' </p>
              <p> `How do you mean?' </p>
              <p> `It's not only that she likes you - she says that Kitty is certain 
                to be your wife.' </p>
              <p> At these words Levin's face suddenly lighted up with a smile, 
                a smile not far from touching tears. </p>
              <p> `She says that!' cried out Levin. `I always said she was charming, 
                your wife. There, that's enough said about it,' he said, getting 
                up from his seat. </p>
              <p> `Well, but do sit down.' </p>
              <p> But Levin could not sit down. He walked with his firm tread 
                twice up and down the little cage of a room, blinked his eyelids 
                that his tears might not fall, and only then sat down to the table. 
              </p>
              <p> `You must understand,' said he, `it's not love. I've been in 
                love, but it's not that. It's not my feeling, but a sort of force 
                outside me that has taken possession of me. I went away, you see, 
                because I made up my mind that it could never be - you understand, 
                like a happiness which is not of this earth; but I've struggled 
                with myself, and I see there's no living without it. And it must 
                be settled.' </p>
              <p> `What did you go away for?' </p>
              <p> `Ah, stop a minute! Ah, the thoughts that come crowding on one! 
                The questions one must ask oneself! Listen. You can't imagine 
                what you've done for me by what you said. I'm so happy that I've 
                become positively hateful; I've forgotten everything. I heard 
                today that my brother Nikolai... you know, he's here... I had 
                forgotten even him. It seems to me that he's happy too. It's a 
                sort of madness. But one thing's awful.... Here, you've been married, 
                you know the feeling.... It's awful that we - fully mature - with 
                a past... a past not of love, but of sins... are brought all at 
                once so near to a creature pure and innocent; it's loathsome, 
                and that's why one can't help feeling oneself unworthy.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, well, you haven't many sins on your conscience.' </p>
              <p> `Ah, still,' said Levin, ```When, with loathing, I go o'er my 
                life, I shudder and I curse and bitterly regret...'' Yes.' </p>
              <p> `What would you have? That's the way of the world,' said Stepan 
                Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> `There's one comfort, like that of the prayer which I always 
                liked: ``Forgive me not according to my deeds, but according to 
                Thy loving-kindness.'' That's the only way she can forgive me.'

                When Oblonsky asked Levin what had brought him to town, Levin 
                blushed, and was furious with himself for blushing, because he 
                could not answer: `I have come to make your sister-in-law a proposal,' 
                though that was solely what he had come for. </p>
              <p>The families of the Levins and the Shcherbatskys were old, noble 
                Moscow families, and had always been on intimate and friendly 
                terms. This intimacy had grown still closer during Levin's student 
                days. He had both prepared for the university with the young Prince 
                Shcherbatsky, the brother of Kitty and Dolly, and had entered 
                at the same time with him. In those days Levin was a frequent 
                visitor at the house of the Shcherbatskys, and he was in love 
                with the Shcherbatsky household. Strange as it may appear, it 
                was with the household, the family that Constantin Levin was in 
                love, especially with the feminine half of the household. Levin 
                did not remember his own mother, and his only sister was older 
                than he was, so that it was in the Shcherbatsky's house that he 
                saw for the first time that inner life of an old, noble, cultured 
                and honorable family of which he had been deprived by the death 
                of his father and mother. All the members of that family, especially 
                the feminine half, were pictured by him, as it were, wrapped about 
                with a mysterious poetical veil, and he not only perceived no 
                defects whatever in them, but, under the poetical veil that shrouded 
                them, he assumed the existence of the loftiest sentiments and 
                every possible perfection. Why it was the three young ladies had 
                one day to speak French, and the next English; why it was that 
                at certain hours they played by turns on the piano, the sounds 
                of which were audible in their brother's room above, where the 
                students used to work; why they were visited by those professors 
                of French literature, of music, of drawing, of dancing; why at 
                certain hours all the three young ladies, with Mademoiselle Linon, 
                drove in the coach to the Tverskoy boulevard, dressed in their 
                satin cloaks, Dolly in a long one, Natalie in a half-long one, 
                and Kitty in one so short that her shapely legs in tightly-drawn 
                red stockings were visible to all beholders; why it was they had 
                to walk about the Tverskoy boulevard escorted by a footman with 
                a gold cockade in his hat - all this and much more that was done 
                in their mysterious world he did not understand, but he was sure 
                that everything that was done there was very good, and he was 
                in love precisely with the mystery of the proceedings. </p>
              <p> In his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest, 
                Dolly, but she was soon married to Oblonsky. Then he began being 
                in love with the second. He felt, as it were, that he had to be 
                in love with one of the sisters, only he could not quite make 
                out which. But Natalie, too, had hardly made her appearance in 
                the world when she married the diplomat Lvov. Kitty was still 
                a child when Levin left the university. Young Shcherbatsky went 
                into the navy, was drowned in the Baltic and Levin's visits to 
                the Shcherbatskys, despite his friendship with Oblonsky, became 
                less frequent. But when early in the winter of this year Levin 
                came to Moscow, after a year in the country, and saw the Shcherbatskys, 
                he realized which of the three sisters he was indeed destined 
                to love. </p>
              <p> One would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for 
                him, a man of good family, rather rich than poor, and thirty-two 
                years old, to make the young Princess Shcherbatskaia an offer 
                of marriage; in all likelihood he would at once have been looked 
                upon as a good match. But Levin was in love, and so it seemed 
                to him that Kitty was so perfect in every respect, a creature 
                so far above everything earthly, while he was a creature so low 
                and so earthly that it could not even be conceived that other 
                people and she herself could regard him as worthy of her. </p>
              <p> After spending two months in Moscow in a state of befuddlement, 
                seeing Kitty almost every day in society, into which he went so 
                as to meet her, he abruptly decided that it could not be, and 
                went back to the country. </p>
              <p> Levin's conviction that it could not be was founded on the idea 
                that in the eyes of her family he was a disadvantageous and worthless 
                match for the charming Kitty, and that Kitty herself could not 
                love him. In her family's eyes he had no ordinary, definite career 
                and position in society, while his comrades by this time, when 
                he was thirty-two, were already one a colonel, and another a professor, 
                another director of a bank and railways, or chairman of a board, 
                like Oblonsky. But he (he knew very well how he must appear to 
                others) was a country gentleman, occupied in breeding cattle, 
                shooting game and building barns; in other words, a fellow of 
                no ability, who had not turned out well, and who was doing just 
                what, according to the ideas of the world, is done by people fit 
                for nothing else. </p>
              <p> The mysterious, enchanting Kitty herself could not love such 
                an ugly person as he conceived himself to be, and, above all, 
                such an ordinary, in no way striking person. Moreover, his attitude 
                to Kitty in the past - the attitude of a grown-up person to a 
                child, arising from his friendship with her brother - seemed to 
                him yet another obstacle to love. An ugly, good-natured man, as 
                he considered himself, might, he supposed, be liked as a friend; 
                but to be loved with such a love as that with which he loved Kitty, 
                one would need to be handsome and, still more, a distinguished 
                man. </p>
              <p> He had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary 
                men, but he did not believe it, for he judged by himself, and 
                he could not himself have loved any but beautiful, mysterious 
                and exceptional women. </p>
              <p> But, after spending two months alone in the country, he was 
                convinced that this was not one of those passions of which he 
                had had experience in his early youth; that this feeling gave 
                him not an instant's rest; that he could not live without deciding 
                the question as to whether she would or would not be his wife; 
                that his despair had arisen only from his own imaginings, and 
                that he had no sort of proof that he would be rejected. So he 
                had now come to Moscow with a firm determination to make a proposal, 
                and get married if he were accepted. Or... he could not conceive 
                what would become of him if he were rejected. </p>

              <p><br>
                Vronsky was staying in a roomy, clean, Finnish hut, divided into 
                two by a partition. Petritsky lived with him in camp too. Petritsky 
                was asleep when Vronsky and Iashvin came into the hut. </p>
              <p>`Get up, don't go on sleeping,' said Iashvin, going behind the 
                partition and giving Petritsky, who was lying with ruffled hair 
                and with his nose in the pillow, a prod on the shoulder. </p>
              <p> Petritsky jumped up suddenly onto his knees and looked around. 
              </p>
              <p> `Your brother's been here,' he said to Vronsky. `He waked me 
                up, the devil take him, and said he'd look in again.' And pulling 
                up the rug he flung himself back on the pillow. `Oh do quit that, 
                Iashvin!' he said, getting furious with Iashvin, who was pulling 
                the rug off him. `Quit that!' He turned over and opened his eyes. 
                `You'd better tell me what to drink; I've such a nasty taste in 
                my mouth that...' </p>
              <p> `Vodka's better than anything,' boomed Iashvin. `Tereshchenko! 
                Vodka for your master and cucumbers,' he shouted, obviously taking 
                pleasure in the sound of his own voice. </p>
              <p> `Vodka, do you think? Eh?' queried Petritsky, blinking and rubbing 
                his eyes. `And you'll drink something? All right then, we'll have 
                a drink together! Vronsky, have a drink?' said Petritsky, getting 
                up and wrapping the tiger-striped bedcover round him. He went 
                to the door of the partition wall, raised his hands, and hummed 
                in French: ``there was a king in Thu-u-le.'' Vronsky, will you 
                have a drink?' </p>
              <p> `Go along,' said Vronsky, putting on the coat his valet handed 
                him. </p>
              <p> `Where are you off to?' asked Iashvin. `Oh, here is your troika,' 
                he added, seeing the carriage drive up. </p>
              <p> `To the stables, and I've got to see Briansky, too, about the 
                horses,' said Vronsky. </p>
              <p> Vronsky had as a fact promised to call at Briansky's, some ten 
                verstas from Peterhof, and to bring him money owing for some horses; 
                and he hoped to have time to get that in too. But his comrades 
                were at once aware that that was not the only place he was going. 
              </p>
              <p> Petritsky, still humming, winked and made a pout with his lips, 
                as though he would say: `Oh, yes, we know your Briansky!' </p>
              <p> `Mind you're not late!' was Iashvin's only comment; and, to 
                change the conversation: `How's my roan? Is he doing all right?' 
                he inquired, looking out of the window at the shaft horse, which 
                he had sold to Vronsky. </p>
              <p> `Stop!' cried Petritsky to Vronsky, just as he was going out. 
                `Your brother left a letter and a note for you. Wait a bit; where 
                are they?' </p>
              <p> Vronsky stopped. </p>
              <p> `Well, where are they?' </p>
              <p> `Where are they? That's just the question!' said Petritsky solemnly, 
                sliding his forefinger upward along his nose. </p>
              <p> `Come, tell me; this is silly!' said Vronsky smiling. </p>
              <p> `I haven't lighted the fire. They must be here somewhere.' </p>
              <p> `Come, enough fooling! Where is the letter?' </p>
              <p> `No, I've forgotten, really. Or was it a dream? Wait a bit, 
                wait a bit! But what's the use of getting in a rage? If you'd 
                drunk four bottles per man yesterday as I did, you'd forget where 
                you were at. Wait a bit, I'll remember!' </p>
              <p> Petritsky went behind the partition and lay down on his bed. 
              </p>
              <p> `Wait a bit! This was how I was lying, and this was how he was 
                standing. Yes - yes - yes... Here it is!' - and Petritsky pulled 
                a letter out from under the mattress, where he had hidden it. 
              </p>
              <p> Vronsky took the letter and his brother's note. It was the letter 
                he was expecting - from his mother, reproaching him for not having 
                been to see her - and the note was from his brother to say that 
                he must have a little talk with him. Vronsky knew that it was 
                all about the same thing. `What business is it of theirs!' thought 
                Vronsky, and crumpling up the letters he thrust them between the 
                buttons of his coat so as to read them carefully on the road. 
                In the porch of the hut he was met by two officers; one of his 
                regiment and one of another. </p>
              <p> Vronsky's quarters were always a meeting place for all the officers. 
              </p>
              <p> `Where are you off to?' </p>
              <p> `I must go to Peterhof.' </p>
              <p> `Has the mare come from Tsarskoe?' </p>
              <p> `Yes, but I've not seen her yet.' </p>
              <p> `They say Makhotin's Gladiator's lame.' </p>
              <p> `Nonsense! However, are you going to race in this mud?' said 
                the other. </p>
              <p> `Here are my saviors!' cried Petritsky, seeing them come in. 
                Before him stood the batman with vodka and pickled cucumbers on 
                a tray. `Here's Iashvin, ordering me to drink a pick-me-up.' </p>
              <p> `Well, you did make it hot for us yesterday,' said one of those 
                who had come in; `you didn't let us get a wink of sleep all night.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, didn't we make a pretty finish!' said Petritsky. `Volkov 
                climbed onto the roof and began telling us how sad he was. I said: 
                ``Let's have music, the funeral march!'' He fairly dropped asleep 
                on the roof over the funeral march.' </p>
              <p> `Drink it up; you positively must drink the vodka, and then 
                Seltzer water, and a lot of lemon,' said Iashvin, standing over 
                Petritsky like a mother making a child take medicine, `and then 
                a little champagne - just a wee bottle.' </p>
              <p> `Come, there's some sense in that. Stop a bit, Vronsky. We'll 
                all have a drink.' </p>
              <p> `No; good-by, all of you. I'm not going to drink today.' </p>
              <p> `Why, are you gaining weight? All right, then we must have it 
                alone. Give us the Seltzer water and lemon.' </p>
              <p> `Vronsky!' shouted someone when he was already outside. </p>
              <p> `Well?' </p>
              <p> `You'd better get your hair cut, it'll weigh you down - especially 
                at the bald place.' </p>
              <p> Vronsky was in fact beginning, prematurely, to get a little 
                bald. He laughed gaily, showing his heavy teeth, and pulling his 
                cap over the thin place, went out and got into his carriage. </p>
              <p> `To the stables!' he said, and was just pulling out the letters 
                to read them through, but thought better of it, and put off reading 
                them so as not to distract his attention before looking at the 
                mare. `Later on!...' </p>

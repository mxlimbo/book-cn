            <p> An aerial shot showing us the whole of the event.</p>
            <p> Security of every kind covers every inch of the island.</p>
            <p> Helicopters are coming in at the rate of about one every minute 
              to deliver dignitaries and their families from all over the globe.</p>
            <p> EXT. ELLIS ISLAND - BRIDGE TO NEW JERSEY - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A steady flow of limos pour onto the island over a simple two-lane 
              bridge from New Jersey.</p>
            <p> A NEWSCASTER IN THE FOREGROUND.</p>
            <p> NEWSCASTER<br>
              With the ceremonies beginning shortly, it looks as though the last 
              of the dignitaries have landed at Newark and Teterboro airports 
              and will be arriving momentarily. It would seem the United Nations 
              has had their wish tonight. There doesn&uml;&ordf;t seem to be an 
              empty seat in the house. </p>
            <p> EXT. BATTERY PARK - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The pier of the Ferry to Liberty Island.</p>
            <p> A great many families have come to watch curiously the going on.</p>
            <p> EXT. MANHATTAN HARBOR - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The harbor is filled with police and Coast Guard vessels <br>
              watching the water closely.</p>
            <p> INT. NEW YORK CITY APARTMENTS/VARIOUS - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A series of shots showing the many folks gathering to watch the 
              historic event on television.</p>
            <p> In some of these apartments, Ellis and Liberty islands can be 
              seen from their windows in the distance.</p>
            <p> INT. SECURITY CONTROL CENTER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The OPERATING COMMANDER monitors the countless video <br>
              screens that display nearly every crevice of Ellis Island as well 
              as other parts of New York Harbor as well as the network news feeds 
              of the event...</p>
            <p> EXT. ELLIS ISLAND - MAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The front of the Great Hall of Ellis Island, where once <br>
              immigrants poured into the new world by the millions.</p>
            <p> A huge military band off to one side plays music from the <br>
              different countries to help with the milling about and shaking of 
              hands.</p>
            <p> The PRESIDENT himself is in the crowd, meeting and greeting, a 
              mob of Secret Service always right there. Follow him into:</p>
            <p> INT. ELLIS ISLAND - MAIN HALL</p>
            <p> A YASSAR ARAFAT TYPE, who we will call Yassir Arafat, <br>
              comes up to the President and smiles.</p>
            <p> The President introduces his WIFE AND CHILD as more <br>
              delegates approach.</p>
            <p> The two men LAUGH and then HUG to the flashing of a <br>
              million bulbs.</p>
            <p> Smattering of ass-kissy applause. Arafat and the President wave 
              to press and the like.</p>
            <p> EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> We are looking down on what APPEARS TO BE a deserted part of the 
              island. Away from the action.</p>
            <p> PAN ACROSS THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND</p>
            <p> Every fifty feet or so, uniformed Secret Service agents keep tight 
              watch on the island.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> One Secret Service guy in particular.</p>
            <p> PUSH IN FROM ABOVE - We realize we are pushing in <br>
              unusually fast, as though we are falling.</p>
            <p> WHAM. A sickening crunch.</p>
            <p> Toad lands on top of the Secret Service guy. We have <br>
              been watching from his P.O.V. The Secret Service man is <br>
              tumbled into a heap. A real frog rabbits O.S. </p>
            <p> Toad looks around quietly, listens... THEN LEAPS out of <br>
              frame. Hold on the body of the Secret Service guy.</p>
            <p> LONG PAUSE.</p>
            <p> ANOTHER SICKENING CRUNCH OFF SCREEN.</p>
            <p> EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Two Secret Service guys approach one another. One is holding a 
              smoke, the other is producing a lighter. Just as his smoke is about 
              to hit the flame, the flame dodges to one side. He moves the smoke 
              to follow it, and the flame dodges the other way.</p>
            <p> The guy with the smoke looks at the guy with the lighter as if 
              to say &uml;&not;knock it off.? The guy with the lighter shrugs 
              as:</p>
            <p> THE FLAME INSTANTLY GROWS TO A RAGING INTENSITY, ENGULFING THEM.</p>
            <p> As they are incinerated and their ashes fall to the ground, Pyro 
              climbs into view from the seawall below, dripping wet.</p>
            <p> He has come dressed to make trouble tonight. Strapped to his back 
              is an impressive looking flame thrower. A three tanker.</p>
            <p> EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A Coast Guard boat crawls into view just off shore. A Secret Service 
              man in the foreground waves to the boat as it passes by.</p>
            <p> EXT. COAST GUARD BOAT DECK - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A thirty footer. Fast and sturdy.</p>
            <p> The PILOT OF THE BOAT, a man in his late forties, waves <br>
              back.</p>
            <p> EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As the Secret Service guy waves, he jolts upright, his face contorting 
              in impossible pain. Slowly, he is lifted off the ground.</p>
            <p> EXT. COAST GUARD BOAT DECK - NIGHT</p>
            <p> PILOT&uml;&ordf;S P.O.V.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth holds the last Secret Service man aloft, impaled on 
              his claws. He waves now, the body swaying this way and that before 
              he casually throws it to the ground.</p>
            <p> The Pilot turns to the wheel of the boat as he MORPHS INTO MYSTIQUE 
              and turns the boat toward the island.</p>
            <p> EXT. BOTTOM OF THE SEAWALL - BOAT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Man-made rocky shore. The boat bumps and grinds on the rock. Sabretooth 
              jumps down to the deck and meets Magneto coming up from below. They 
              nod to one another and walk toward the front of the boat. On the 
              deck is something covered with a tarp. Sabretooth pulls back the 
              tarp to reveal Logan, still unconscious from the drug.</p>
            <p> ANOTHER, MUCH LARGER OBJECT is on the back of the boat under another 
              tarp, but we cannot see what it is.</p>
            <p> Magneto steps off the boat and looks up -- up at someplace we 
              cannot yet see.</p>
            <p> EXT. ELLIS ISLAND - GREAT HALL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The dignitaries take their seats as the ceremony commences.</p>
            <p> INT. X-JET - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Cyclops pilots the plane as Manhattan comes into view. <br>
              They bank to the south. Cyclops checks his monitors.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              Radar Stealth Mode checks out. All right, there&uml;&ordf;ll be 
              less security north of the George Washington Bridge. I&uml;&ordf;m 
              taking her down.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Into the Hudson?</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              (smiles)<br>
              Uh-huh.</p>
            <p> EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The X-Jet slows to a hover. It&uml;&ordf;s Harrier Jet engines 
              tilt back until they are vertical to the water. The engines cycle 
              down and the plane lowers until it is hovering a few feet off the 
              surface.</p>
            <p> INT. X-JET - NIGHT</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              V.T.O.L. off.</p>
            <p> EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The Jet&uml;&ordf;s engines cut and the plane splashes down into 
              the water. It floats there for a moment and then sinks below the 
              surface.</p>
            <p> EXT. BELOW RIVER SURFACE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As the X-Jet sinks, the hatches close off and the wings retract 
              to transform the plane into a submarine. The engines pull tight 
              to the body of the craft and begin to propel it forward.</p>
            <p> EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> AERIAL VIEW: The water ripples as the submersed aircraft <br>
              passes under the bridge and into the harbor. </p>
            <p> INT. SMALL ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> C.U. on Logan. He wakes. His arms are cuffed behind his <br>
              back. He is delirious and weakened from the drug.</p>
            <p> He looks around and sees that he is in an oddly shaped room with 
              barely enough space for him and Magneto, who smiles at him in the 
              half darkness.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              (very weak)<br>
              Where am I?</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              You&uml;&ordf;re backstage at the encore of creation.</p>
            <p> He looks at his watch.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Three minutes to curtain.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              What are you going to do?</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan. We are 
              the future... not them. We must protect ourselves. After tonight, 
              when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as 
              brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs. This is survival, 
              I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?</p>
            <p> He steps out of the hatch and closes it.</p>
            <p> EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Magneto who looks down. From atop what, we cannot tell.</p>
            <p> Magneto comes to stand on a railing outside from his high <br>
              perch, overlooking the island. From here we pull out to reveal at 
              last where he is.</p>
            <p> HE IS NOT ON ELLIS ISLAND AT ALL</p>
            <p> Instead, he stands on the catwalk around the torch of the Statue 
              of Liberty, about a mile away. He has his back to it&uml;&ordf;s 
              gold translucent flame, looking over at the activity on Ellis Island, 
              hearing the band and inhaling the cool evening breeze.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Give me your tired, your poor...</p>
            <p> And he turns to the bright lights of Manhattan and it&uml;&ordf;s 
              millions of inhabitants.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              ... Your huddled masses.</p>
            <p> He brings a radio to his lips.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Lights.</p>
            <p> EXT. POWER STATION - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Sabretooth is tearing the padlocks off of the generator shed that 
              powers the island.</p>
            <p> INT. POWER STATION - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Sabretooth grabs a hold of a fuse lever marked &uml;&not;Liberty 
              <br>
              Display Lights? and pulls it down. Turning it off.</p>
            <p> INT. TORCH - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Logan is now in darkness. He frantically pulls on his binds. No 
              use.</p>
            <p> INT. X-JET - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Cyclops is monitoring the area above-water on a video screen.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              (points to the monitor)<br>
              The lights on the Statue of Liberty <br>
              are off.</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              Beast said that he would have to take a high vantage point.</p>
            <p> Cyclops, motioning to an open area of water next to Liberty Island.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              Let&uml;&ordf;s dock over there.</p>
            <p> Cyclops pulls a lever. The X-Jet begins to surface.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Storm, give us some cover.</p>
            <p> INT. APARTMENTS/VARIOUS - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Televisions all over the city show the Statue sitting dark to 
              countless curious viewers.</p>
            <p> INT. X-JET - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The water level outside the X-Jet lowers as the plane surfaces.</p>
            <p> EXT. X-JET - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The plane rises until it is nearly flush with the surface of the 
              water -- Not a hundred yards from an obvious Coast Guard cutter. 
              Out the jet&uml;&ordf;s window, the Statue rises away into the fog 
              that is now rolling in over the Harbor.</p>
            <p> INT. SECURITY CONTROL CENTER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> The OPERATIONS COMMANDER raises a radio to his mouth.</p>
            <p> OPERATION COMMANDER<br>
              Liberty One, Liberty One, this is Horizon, do you copy.</p>
            <p> AN AGENT&uml;&ordf;S VOICE RESPONDS.</p>
            <p> AGENT&uml;&ordf;S VOICE<br>
              Go, Horizon.</p>
            <p> OPERATION COMMANDER<br>

              Liberty, what&uml;&ordf;s the situation with the lights, over?</p>
            <p> EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - NIGHT</p>
            <p> IT IS MYSTIQUE. The lower part of her face and the whole <br>
              her neck are that of a stocky man.</p>
            <p> MYSTIQUE/AGENT&uml;&ordf;S VOICE<br>
              Uhhh, Horizon, we&uml;&ordf;ve seem to have had a shutdown at the 
              generator, we&uml;&ordf;re five by five. There now, checking it 
              out. Everything is fine other-wise.</p>

            <p> MYSTIQUE<br>
              Darling... We&uml;&ordf;re clear.</p>
            <p> EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Jean, Cyclops, Storm and Rogue step off the wing tip of the X-Jet 
              onto the island. They climb over the fog encased seawall and stand 
              staring up at the Statue and the desolate island.</p>
            <p> EXT. TORCH - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Magneto takes this moment in the darkness to point his hands and 
              all of his concentration on the bottom of the torch.</p>
            <p> The air RIPPLES with magnetic energy as -- the cap-like end piece 
              of the torch begins to vibrate, metal groans, twists...</p>
            <p> WITH A CRACK OF METAL, it comes free, dropping to the <br>
              ground.</p>
            <p> INT. TORCH - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Logan stares down through the hollow torch as the cap falls away 
              into the fog.</p>
            <p> EXT. STATUE - BOTTOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The foursome are deciding how to proceed.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              We should check out operations, see if the Secret Service is still 
              around.</p>
            <p> Storm is surveying the layout of the island. She looks up at the 
              Statue.</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              LOOK OUT.</p>
            <p> They all look up. The cap of the torch is SCREAMING DOWN <br>
              towards them out of the sky. It crashes down as they leap out of 
              the way.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;m going to assume that means that the Secret Service 
              is out of <br>
              commission. Jean, can you raise me up there?</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              It&uml;&ordf;s too far.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              (assessing the situation)<br>
              Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance. (pointing to the main 
              entrance) Jean and I will go in here.</p>
            <p> Storm and Rogue start for the south entrance.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>

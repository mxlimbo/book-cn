            <p> They come into a room with a high sphered ceiling - entirely black.</p>
            <p> In the center of the room is a huge - for lack of a better term 
              - device. Part computer, part super- structure, it is the sort of 
              precision tangle of metal and wire that would make Da Vinci weep. 
              It has a space in the bottom that seems to fit Xavier and his chair 
              perfectly. Suspended above its center -- a web of wires, tubes, 
              and cables all connecting to the heart of the device -- a CHROME 
              SKULLCAP.</p>
            <p> Logan slowly circles the device.</p>
            <p> Logan looks at Xavier, perhaps even a little impressed.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              You designed this yourself?</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              He helped you?</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              We were friends once... But that was a long time ago.</p>
            <p> Jean, Logan, Cyclops and Storm watch as Xavier fits his <br>
              wheelchair into the huge machine, and the chrome skull cap lowers 
              onto the Professor&uml;&ordf;s head, fitting like a second skin. 
              It comes to life. What was dark and menacing is now a brilliant 
              explosion of colored lights.</p>
            <p> CLOSE UP ON:</p>
            <p> XAVIER - into and through his eyes and:</p>
            <p> EXT. SPACE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Closing in rapidly on the planet Earth.</p>
            <p> Passing into its atmosphere, making a few orbits, all the while 
              hearing the deafening voices of billions.</p>
            <p> Every country, every city, every town, berg, hamlet and village.</p>
            <p> Every language.</p>
            <p> Every thought.</p>
            <p> The voices descend to a sizeable crowd of millions, then <br>
              thousands, gradually working their way to one.</p>
            <p> EXT. SKY - OVER WESTCHESTER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Down a tree-lined road and around a corner into a parking <br>
              lot.</p>
            <p> Single out a figure that - by the clothes - can only be Rogue. 
              Close in faster and faster, lower and lower until we go right through 
              the back of her head to:</p>
            <p> BLACK</p>
            <p> SILENCE</p>
            <p> ROGUE (O.S.)<br>
              I don&uml;&ordf;t belong... I don&uml;&ordf;t belong... <br>
              I&uml;&ordf;m sorry... so sorry... there&uml;&ordf;s <br>
              nowhere...</p>
            <p> INT. CEREBRO - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Xavier&uml;&ordf;s eyes open.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;ve found her, Westchester Mall.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;ll go.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              No... I&uml;&ordf;ll go.</p>
            <p> Logan looks over to Jean.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              O.K. sport... you go.</p>
            <p> INT. WESTCHESTER MALL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A mother and child wander in a typical shopping daze.</p>
            <p> PULL OUT TO REVEAL</p>
            <p> Crowds of shoppers mill about, a typical crowded evening <br>
              at the mall. Rogue comes up the escalator, wandering through them 
              all.</p>
            <p> She walks under a high-sphered glass ceiling, revealing the night 
              sky outside.</p>
            <p> She walks over to a Victoria&uml;&ordf;s Secret store and looks 
              up <br>
              at the mannequins in the windows who wear almost nothing <br>
              at all. Quite a contrast from her own, stifling garb. She touches 
              the glass as though trying to reach them, then she moves on.</p>
            <p> ROGUE&uml;&ordf;S P.O.V.</p>
            <p> She looks all around the mall at the many oblivious people here. 
              Children playing tag on one side. A young couple holding hands.</p>
            <p> Human contact all around.</p>
            <p> She walks past a small child, her hand nearly brushing the girl&uml;&ordf;s 
              hair.</p>
            <p> Rogue takes a seat on a bench, alone.</p>
            <p> A figure comes into frame.</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              Rogue.</p>
            <p> Rogue looks up and sees Storm standing right in front of <br>
              her. Her eyes dart around, looking for a way out.</p>
            <p> STORM (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              You don&uml;&ordf;t have to run.</p>
            <p> Finally, Rogue surrenders.</p>
            <p> ROGUE<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;m sorry. I&uml;&ordf;m not like the rest of <br>
              you -- I&uml;&ordf;m tired of hurting people.</p>
            <p> She starts to cry now.</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              It&uml;&ordf;s okay.</p>
            <p> ROGUE<br>
              Why did I have to be like this? What <br>
              purpose does it serve?</p>
            <p> And when Rogue looks up, she sees another figure - this one filling 
              the frame behind Storm.</p>
            <p> A huge clawed hand grabs Storm around the throat and lifts her 
              up as she struggles in vain.</p>
            <p> INT. MALL - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Cyclops looks up and sees Storm is being CHOKED BY <br>
              SABRETOOTH, her feet not touching the ground.</p>
            <p> Rogue is frozen with fear.</p>
            <p> He tries to get a shot with his visor, but too many people are 
              in the way.</p>
            <p> INT. MALL - UPPER LEVEL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Sabretooth smiles as Storm struggles to turn. He whispers in her 
              ear.</p>
            <p> SABRETOOTH<br>
              Scream for me.</p>
            <p> CLOSE UP ON:</p>
            <p> STORM&uml;&ordf;S EYES as the life is being squeezed out of her.</p>
            <p> INT. XAVIER&uml;&ordf;S OFFICE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> MIRROR SHOT OF XAVIER&uml;&ordf;S EYES</p>
            <p> Suddenly, Xavier touches his throat, then raises a shaking hand 
              to his head.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              Dear God.</p>
            <p> Xavier wheels himself from the room.</p>
            <p> INT. MALL - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Cyclops has a clear shot now. His eyes start to glow brightly.</p>
            <p> Suddenly, a familiar movement on the pedestal behind him. <br>
              Toad has been camouflaged the entire time. He comes down <br>
              and FLICKS HIS LIZARD-LIKE TONGUE, snatching the visor <br>
              from Cyclops&uml;&ordf; face.</p>
            <p> Deep red light far greater than anything we have ever seen before 
              comes blasting out of cyclops&uml;&ordf; eyes without any sort of 
              control, as if a fire hydrant had been ripped from the ground.</p>
            <p> His head comes back and the light blows the whole of the glass 
              ceiling to smithereens, bringing it down on panicking shoppers who 
              scatter.</p>
            <p> Toad leaps to the second level and then again out of sight.</p>
            <p> INT. MALL - UPPER LEVEL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Sabretooth reacts, surprised by the sudden shift. This gives Storm 
              one last chance to breath.</p>
            <p> We notice now that something is happening to her body.</p>
            <p> INT. MALL - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Cyclops stumbles helpless, his eyes are shut to prevent further 
              destruction.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              GET OUT OF THE WAY. GET OUT OF THE <br>
              WAY.</p>
            <p> INT. MALL - UPPER LEVEL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Storm, nearly lifeless now, struggles with what little strength 
              she has to get free of Sabretooth. He relishes the slow kill.</p>
            <p> But suddenly ALL THE HAIR ON HIS BODY STANDS ON END. <br>
              Sabretooth is momentarily confused.</p>
            <p> Storm&uml;&ordf;s eyes open wide as her body convulses.</p>
            <p> BOOM</p>
            <p> A huge bolt of lightning shoot from her body into Sabretooth&uml;&ordf;s 
              chest, knocking him back in shock. Storm falls to the ground, not 
              breathing.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth, stunned and scorched, gets to his feet and smiles 
              at his handiwork. He is about to move in and finish them both when 
              the rumble of a helicopter can be heard above.</p>
            <p> He looks up and sees SENATOR KELLY&uml;&ordf;S HELICOPTER passing 
              <br>
              over the hold in the roof. Sabretooth leaps up and pulls <br>
              himself out of the opening.</p>
            <p> Toad is a leap behind.</p>
            <p> Rogue rushes to Storm, struggling with how to give her mouth to 
              mouth, CPR, anything to resuscitate her without touching. She is 
              starting to panic now. She looks around, but anyone still left in 
              the mall is running for the doors.</p>
            <p> ROGUE<br>
              SOMEONE HELP ME. SHE&uml;&ordf;S NOT BREATHING.</p>
            <p> INT. MALL - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Cyclops stumbles blind and helpless, covering his eyes. <br>
              He hears Rogue screaming.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              ROGUE?</p>
            <p> ROGUE (O.S.)<br>
              HELP ME. STORM ISN&uml;&ordf;T BREATHING.</p>
            <p> Cyclops tries to find a way up, but he trips over all the debris, 
              helpless.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              YOU HAVE TO COME AND GET ME. I CAN&uml;&ordf;T SEE.</p>
            <p> EXT. STREETS - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Xavier is in a specially designed car that enables him to drive 
              solely with his hands. He races towards the mall.</p>
            <p> INT. MALL - UPPER LEVEL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Rogue is talking, walking backwards towards Storm, trying <br>
              her best not to lay a hand on Cyclops.</p>
            <p> ROGUE<br>
              Here, here, here... a little left. <br>
              Careful.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Cyclops drops to his knees, the sprinklers still gushing. His 
              eyes are tightly shut.</p>
            <p> He feels for Storm&uml;&ordf;s face and touches her lips.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              Oh God.</p>
            <p> He immediately begins mouth to mouth, though it may have <br>
              been too long.</p>
            <p> EXT. MALL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Xavier fights the rush of traffic - people fleeing madly from 
              the mall.</p>
            <p> As he pulls up to the front doors, he sees Cyclops emerging, carrying 
              Storm. She is conscious, but her breathing is shallow. His eyes 
              are shut tightly and he must follow Rogue&uml;&ordf;s direction.</p>
            <p> Sirens wail in the distance.</p>
            <p> Xavier looks at the lot of them: waifish Rogue, blind Cyclops, 
              unconscious Storm and his wheelchair-bound self as their guardian.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              But why would they do this?</p>
            <p> Then a look of realization...</p>
            <p> EXT. MANSION - MEANWHILE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Rogue hurries past several students.</p>
            <p> She runs up to the large front doors of the school, but they are 
              locked. She looks around and then runs toward the side of the building.</p>
            <p> INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Beast, continuing his research into Magneto&uml;&ordf;s plan, 
              is analyzing the x-rays of Logan&uml;&ordf;s skeleton. Several books 
              about metallurgy are scattered across the table.</p>
            <p> INT. LOGAN&uml;&ordf;S ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Logan is sketching quietly. He chews a cigar, keeping it politely 
              unlit.</p>
            <p> He hears something. He stands, goes to the door and opens it. 
              He cocks his head... listening... smiling...</p>
            <p> We hear it too, sharing his ears.</p>
            <p> It is a woman breathing, groaning. He smiles and follows the noise.</p>
            <p> EXT. MANSION - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Rogue climbs through a student&uml;&ordf;s open window.</p>
            <p> INT. MANSION - NIGHT</p>
            <p> She darts down a hallway and around a corner, looking around, 
              staying low.</p>
            <p> INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Jean is working out on an average-sized set of free- weights, 
              sweating, pushing hard. Obviously the sound Logan heard. She is 
              on her back doing presses. </p>
            <p> Suddenly, she looks up and sees Logan standing over. She <br>
              is startled and starts to drop the bar. He catches it.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              You should always work with a spotter.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              He&uml;&ordf;s busy right now.</p>
            <p> Logan cannot help but glance at her left hand, still clinging 
              to the bar. The shimmering diamond on the third finger.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Were you now?</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              What do you say?</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Not interested.</p>
            <p> Logan shrugs, starts to take his hands away. Jean is not ready 
              to take the weight of the bar. It almost comes down on her when 
              he catches it again.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Let go.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Suit yourself.</p>
            <p> And he does. And so does Jean at the same time. She gets up and 
              faces Logan - the bar simply hovers in mid- air.</p>
            <p> Logan smiles.</p>
            <p> INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Beast looks at his watch. It&uml;&ordf;s stopped. He puts it to 
              his ear -- shakes it. Then his ears perk up. He hears something. 
              He glances at the wall. All things METAL -- picture frames, chairs, 
              objects on tables, etc. start to move one after the other. <br>
              It is as if some magnetic force is moving past the wall, just outside 
              the lab, heading for the open door.</p>
            <p> Beast, sensing the danger, makes a run for the metal door. Just 
              as he reaches it, it SLAMS closed -- knocking him back across the 
              room.</p>
            <p> Beast CRASHES into the wall on the opposite side of the lab. His 
              leg badly hurt, Beast tries to crawl toward the door.</p>
            <p> But as he does this, METAL OBJECTS from around the lab <br>
              fly in front of it sealing him in.</p>
            <p> INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Rogue moves quietly down the corridor that leads to Cerebro.</p>
            <p> She comes to the retinal scanner - she brings her eye to the screen.</p>
            <p> It lights up and scans her eye. A PICTURE OF XAVIER&uml;&ordf;S 
              <br>
              RETINA appears on the screen.</p>
            <p> A SINGLE WORD APPEARS ON THE SCREEN beneath it:</p>
            <p> ACCESS DENIED</p>
            <p> The scanner scans again.</p>
            <p> E.C.U. ON ROGUE&uml;&ordf;S EYE</p>
            <p> Something is wrong. The eye not being scanned is a familiar yellow. 
              It is Mystique.</p>
            <p> Her other eye changes in the light of the scanner. The retina 
              reshaping itself in minute ways.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: The screen -- ACCESS GRANTED -- CHARLES XAVIER</p>
            <p> The door to Cerebro opens.</p>
            <p> Rogue or rather Mystique, rushes in. She goes to a small <br>
              panel on the side of Cerebro.</p>
            <p> She opens it. She reaches in. SHE REMOVES A COMPUTER <br>
              CHIP -- No more than three inches wide.</p>
            <p> INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: The black boots of a man, walk down a hallway, <br>
              as students peer from their sleeping quarters, terrified.</p>
            <p> INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Jean is casually wiping sweat from her brow. Logan&uml;&ordf;s 
              eyes possess a certain focus intent.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              He&uml;&ordf;s uptight.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              He takes his work seriously.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              He takes himself seriously.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              What is it you&uml;&ordf;re failing to get at? <br>
              Are you interested in me?</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;m just interested.</p>
            <p> Holding out her left hand.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Logan, do you see this ring?</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;ve seen a lot of rings.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Yeah, I&uml;&ordf;ll bet you have.</p>
            <p> Before he can reply, Rogue is standing in the doorway looking 
              at them.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Rogue, where have you been?</p>
            <p> ROGUE<br>
              Logan. The Professor wants you to come with me right away.</p>
            <p> E.C.U. on Logan&uml;&ordf;s nose. His nostrils flare... sensing...</p>
            <p> Logan squints the tiniest bit. We know he knows something is wrong, 
              but he is hiding it.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              (to Rogue)<br>
              Hey Rogue, tell Jean what you were telling me last night.</p>
            <p> Rogue pauses. Confused.</p>
            <p> ROGUE<br>
              The Professor--</p>
            <p> Logan walks towards her.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              You remember. About women.</p>
            <p> He moves closer.</p>
            <p> ROGUE<br>
              Logan--</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Whatever you say about them being the same...</p>
            <p> SHOOK. The claws are out. HE LUNGES.</p>
            <p> LOGAN (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              No two women smell alike.</p>
            <p> He grabs Rogue by the throat.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Logan, what are you doing?</p>
            <p> Jean, seeing Logan threaten Rogue with his claws for the second 
              time, RAISES A VAULTING HORSE INTO THE AIR.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              This ain&uml;&ordf;t Rogue!</p>
            <p> He keeps his claws pointed at her face.</p>
            <p> ANGLE TIGHT: Logan&uml;&ordf;s left hand is wrapped around Rogue&uml;&ordf;s 
              <br>
              throat but part of it is TOUCHING THE EXPOSED SKIN OF HER <br>
              FACE WITH NO ILL EFFECTS.</p>
            <p> Jean realizes that Logan is right. ROGUE MORPHS INTO <br>
              MYSTIQUE.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (O.S.)<br>
              Telekinesis.</p>
            <p> Jean spins around and sees MAGNETO. Without hesitation, <br>
              the vaulting horse FLIES AT MAGNETO.</p>
            <p> Simultaneously, one of the thousand-pound weights flies from the 
              weight set and smashes the vaulting horse aside.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Fascinating. What I wouldn&uml;&ordf;t give for that. Alas, metal 
              is all I&uml;&ordf;m good for. But it seems to serve me well enough.</p>
            <p> Jean is completely unaware of the huge set of lockers rising behind 
              her.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Jean!</p>
            <p> WHAM.</p>
            <p> The lockers hit her in the back, sending her flying.</p>
            <p> Jean lies motionless on the floor, unconscious. The heavy lockers 
              are floating above her, wavering between a few feet and a few inches.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              I do love a good check mate.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              What do you want?</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Come with me and I&uml;&ordf;ll let her live.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              You think I care about her? I&uml;&ordf;m the only one who&uml;&ordf;s 
              sure to walk out of here.</p>
            <p> Pause.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Then why don&uml;&ordf;t you kill her.</p>
            <p> This catches Logan a little off guard.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Go on. Kill her. You can do it quicker than I will. Maybe I&uml;&ordf;ll 
              just cripple her.</p>
            <p> The lockers now stand upright, hovering over Jean&uml;&ordf;s 
              knees.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              So do her the favor. Show her mercy.</p>
            <p> Logan thinks for a moment -- looks at Jean still unconscious on 
              the floor. Then:</p>
            <p> Logan retracts his claws.</p>
            <p> Mystique has morphed back into her natural state with the <br>
              exception of ONE OF ROGUE&uml;&ordf;S POCKETS, which still clings 
              to her hip. Mystique produces a large syringe from the <br>
              pocket and sticks it in Logan&uml;&ordf;s neck. Logan&uml;&ordf;s 
              legs weaken instantly.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              (to Mystique)<br>
              Call the others and tell them we have what we came for.</p>

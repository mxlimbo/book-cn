            <p> Kelly and Guyrich walk out of the White House on their way to their limousine.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              I can&uml;&ordf;t believe the President can&uml;&ordf;t see it. 
              I wouldn&uml;&ordf;t be surprised if he has a mutant on his staff.</p>
            <p> Kelly and Guyrich climb into the limo and slump back in their 
              seats.</p>

            <p> GUYRICH<br>
              Have you thought of a demonstration of some kind? Maybe use the 
              UN Summit to our advantage. The whole world will be watching. </p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;m not interested in the whole world, Henry... I&uml;&ordf;m 
              interested in America. Let the rest of the world deal with mutants 
              their own way.</p>
            <p> GUYRICH<br>
              Where to?</p>
            <p> Kelly rubs his eyes.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              Home.</p>
            <p> Guyrich leans to address the driver.</p>
            <p> GUYRICH<br>
              Dulles Airport.</p>
            <p> INT. LABORATORY - DAY</p>
            <p> Medical monitors beep, keeping track of the vital signs of -- 
              Logan, who lies in a bed in the middle of a medical lab.</p>
            <p> In the wall beside Logan&uml;&ordf;s bed is a light board on which 
              hang Logan&uml;&ordf;s X-rays. Logan&uml;&ordf;s skeleton seems 
              to be more the creation of a Deco architect than of nature. Streamlined, 
              refined... almost manufactured.</p>
            <p> He is asleep, recovering.</p>
            <p> Jean Grey enters the lab. She walks over and examines the X-rays, 
              fascinated by their unique structure. She notices what appears to 
              be an unusually complex network of bones in the forearm. Jean looks 
              down and runs her fingers over the traces of three incisions on 
              the backs of Logan&uml;&ordf;s hands. Jean&uml;&ordf;s eye moves 
              across his body. His rippling muscles.</p>
            <p> Jean uncaps an IV needle and moves to the middle of Logan&uml;&ordf;s 
              arm. We cannot help but notice a diamond ring on her left hand.</p>
            <p> Jean starts to put an IV in Logan&uml;&ordf;s arm.</p>
            <p> Just as she is sticking the needle in his arm HE JOLTS <br>
              VIOLENTLY.</p>
            <p> SNAP</p>
            <p> Logan&uml;&ordf;s hand reaches up quickly, breaking the needle 
              off in his arm. He grabs a startled Jean by the throat.</p>
            <p> He is out of bed. She is unable to speak, choked silent by his 
              grip.</p>
            <p> He places his fist near her face. We see the three faint scars 
              just above his knuckles.</p>
            <p> Hesitation. Logan looks at her for a moment. Taken by her beauty. 
              Then he is on his feet.</p>
            <p> Jean is on the floor, gasping for breath.</p>
            <p> Logan realizes something is missing. He reaches to his chest and 
              feels for the dog tag. Gone. He stifles a curse.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Where is it?</p>
            <p> He looks at Jean who recoils from him in terror. Logan thinks, 
              then bolts.</p>
            <p> INT. HALLWAY - DAY</p>
            <p> Logan comes out into an empty hall. Strange. Deathly quiet. It 
              is very sparse and modern, matching the lab we have just left. Logan 
              runs and goes through the first door he comes to, to keep Jean from 
              seeing where he has gone.</p>
            <p> INT. READY ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> He looks around and sees he is in some sort of locker room. A 
              row of lockers run along one side of the wall. And hanging from 
              the other side in a row, are UNIFORMS, much like the ones Cyclops 
              and Storm were wearing in the snow.</p>
            <p> He starts to rummage through the lockers, coming up with <br>
              a shirt and pants that almost fit. A pair of sneakers as well.</p>
            <p> He hears the sound of approaching foot-steps coming from <br>
              the hallway. He spots another entrance on the far side of the room 
              and, carrying his clothes, he staggers out, still in considerable 
              pain.</p>
            <p> INT. HANGER - DAY</p>
            <p> Logan rushes through the door, looking behind to see if he has 
              been seen. He closes the door and leans back to catch his breath... 
              which stops momentarily as he looks around the massive hanger he 
              has entered.</p>
            <p> The X-Jet, the stealth plane we saw in Alaska, now sits parked 
              and quiet.</p>
            <p> Logan walks to the plane and stops -- listening. We hear a strange 
              THUMPING. He listens for a second. The sound picks up in speed and 
              we realize that we are listening to the SOUNDS OF A BASKETBALL GAME 
              coming from above.</p>
            <p> As Logan tries to digest this, the door that he had just come 
              through begins to open, letting in a shaft of light. Logan looks 
              around wildly for a moment, looking for a place to hide when -</p>
            <p> BING.</p>
            <p> An elevator door opens in the wall of the hanger ten feet from 
              where Logan now stands. He whips around and runs for it.</p>
            <p> There is a button marked &uml;&not;G.? He presses it.</p>
            <p> INT. HALLWAY - DAY</p>
            <p> The elevator opens on a hallway that doesn&uml;&ordf;t match the 
              rooms we have already seen at all. It is plush and stately, the 
              hallway of a great mansion.</p>
            <p> He hears a voice coming from a room.</p>
            <p> As he gets closer to it, we can begin to hear:</p>
            <p> VOICE<br>
              ... until the Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity. With 
              that one act, history was changed. The Christians who were once 
              prosecuted and fed to the lions, became accepted.</p>
            <p> Now the voice is clear as a bell, coming from a room with the 
              door slightly ajar.</p>
            <p> INT. CLASSROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Logan peeks in and sees in front of a chalk board, a massive blue 
              furry creature called BEAST. Besides two arms and two legs, the 
              only remotely human thing on his ape-like face is a pair of wire 
              spectacles. He addresses a class of kids between the ages of 16 
              and 17. Besides the occasional physical alterations, there is an 
              overall oddness to the group, giving way to the fact that in some 
              way or another these are all mutants.</p>
            <p> BEAST<br>
              So as their leaders went, so did follow the hearts and minds of 
              the people of the Roman empire. Which made for some very happy Christians.Now 
              he sees Logan standing in the door, looking back at him in mute 
              shock.</p>
            <p> BEAST (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Can I help you?</p>
            <p> All the students turn to see Logan, standing in a hospital gown 
              with a mean case of bed head. They start to giggle.</p>
            <p> Logan turns and heads down the hallway to the left.</p>
            <p> INT. HALLWAY - DAY</p>
            <p> Logan hears footsteps and quickly does a one eighty back down 
              the hallway. He turns a corner, hugging the wall. He halts. A large 
              oak door stands down the hall. He smells something, taking in a 
              deep breath, his head cocking to the side - listening.</p>
            <p> He turns and looks behind him. More foot steps. Someone is about 
              to enter the hall.</p>
            <p> He turns again, ready to run the other way when he sees the SHADOWS 
              of two more people coming from the other <br>
              direction. Logan is trapped. He lunges for the large oak door and 
              bursts through.</p>
            <p> INT. XAVIER&uml;&ordf;S OFFICE - DAY</p>
            <p> Logan shuts the door and leans his head back against it, exhausted.</p>
            <p> VOICE (O.S.)<br>
              Good morning, Logan.</p>
            <p> Logan, still clutching his stolen clothes, opens his eyes and 
              sees a man sitting behind a large mahogany desk -- PROFESSOR CHARLES 
              XAVIER, an intense and intelligent man just to look at him.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              Would you like some breakfast?</p>
            <p> Logan, who was prepared for anything but this, just stares.</p>
            <p> XAVIER (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;m sorry, allow me to formally introduce myself -- I 
              am Professor Charles Xavier. This is my school.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              How do you know my name?</p>
            <p> Xavier taps the side of his head with his finger.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              You&uml;&ordf;re not the only one with gifts.</p>
            <p> When he speaks, his lips do not move. We realize Logan &uml;&not;hears? 
              the voice in his head. In addition, the voice is <br>
              accompanied by the FAMILIAR SOUND OF FOOT STEPS <br>
              indicating that perhaps Xavier had herded Logan through the mansion 
              with his mind. He does not like it.</p>
            <p> Xavier comes out from behind his desk. We see that he is in a 
              MOTORED WHEELCHAIR. Realizing that he is safe for the moment, Logan 
              begins putting on his stolen clothes.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              What am I doing here?</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Who?</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest 
              in you. I&uml;&ordf;m not sure why, but until we find out, I must 
              ask you to stay.</p>
            <p> Logan looks Xavier over. He is obviously a kind man who is offering 
              his help. Logan is silent for a moment.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              No thanks.</p>
            <p> Logan goes to the door.</p>
            <p> Xavier, disappointed, just watches him go.</p>
            <p> INT. FRONT HALL - DAY</p>
            <p> Logan sees a grand entrance with two huge oak doors and <br>
              brightly-polished steel knobs that scream &uml;&not;exit.? He starts 
              in that direction when the doors begin to open.</p>
            <p> A moment of traffic, laughing, chatter... then they are all gone.</p>
            <p> He gets to the doors and pushes them open. Bright white sunlight 
              floods in, nearly blinding him.</p>
            <p> EXT. MANSION - DAY</p>
            <p> The first thing he sees through the haze is wings - GIANT WHITE, 
              FEATHERY ANGEL WINGS.</p>
            <p> A young boy, no more than fourteen, has them sprouting from his 
              back. He is stretching not only his limbs, but his unusual appendages 
              in the morning breeze.</p>
            <p> Sensing something - the boy turns, and sees this shambling ruin 
              of a man in the doorway.</p>
            <p> Off Logan&uml;&ordf;s expression, we hear the flapping of wings 
              and <br>
              see his awestruck face following the boy onto the sky.</p>
            <p> This only holds his attention for a moment. Logan looks across 
              an expanse of grounds that house the Mansion. A high, wrought-iron 
              gate surrounds the entire property.</p>
            <p> He watches as several children play basketball across a large 
              court.</p>
            <p> Logan shakes his head and is out the closing door.</p>
            <p> Xavier simply watches from his window.</p>
            <p> EXT. MANSION - FRONT GATE - DAY</p>
            <p> Logan heads for the gate.</p>
            <p> SHOOK -- Logan pops his claws.</p>
            <p> Suddenly, the gate slowly opens -- Inviting him to leave. He pauses, 
              momentarily confused. He takes one long look back at the mansion. 
              And then leaves.</p>
            <p> Stay for a moment. Watch him go. Then pan across a sign <br>
              which reads --</p>
            <p> PROFESSOR CHARLES XAVIER&uml;&ordf;S SCHOOL FOR THE GIFTED </p>
            <p> Westchester N.Y.</p>
            <p> PANNING slowly across the road to the thick woods on the <br>
              other side of the street.</p>
            <p> SOMETHING MOVES in the trees, catching our eye. Someone <br>
              is watching. It is Toad, camouflaged amidst the trees <br>
              and branches.</p>
            <p> EXT. SKY - DUSK</p>
            <p> A helicopter streaks across the sky.</p>
            <p> INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK</p>
            <p> Kelly sleeps fitfully in the large seat. A bump of <br>
              turbulence. He wakes suddenly and looks out the window seeing the 
              ocean below.</p>
            <p> Kelly looks out the window again and sees water. They are flying 
              low.</p>
            <p> He looks at Guyrich, who sleeps as well. He wakes him.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              Where the hell are we?</p>
            <p> Guyrich looks out the window and looks at Kelly, puzzled. <br>
              He stands and goes to the door to the cabin of the helicopter.</p>
            <p> GUYRICH<br>
              Pilot?</p>
            <p> No answer. Guyrich tries to open the door. It&uml;&ordf;s locked.</p>
            <p> GUYRICH (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Pilot?</p>
            <p> Kelly looks out the window now and sees the helicopter is <br>
              closing in on an island - where, is anyone&uml;&ordf;s guess. What 
              is known is that the place is no pleasure resort.</p>
            <p> It is in fact some sort of refurbished island fortress, complete 
              with turrets, built right into the side of the cliffs.</p>
            <p> EXT. ISLAND HELIPAD - DUSK</p>
            <p> A clearing in the middle of a ring of trees at the base of a rocky 
              rise. The helicopter touches down.</p>
            <p> THE PILOT, wrapped from head to toe in a flight suit and <br>
              helmet, gets out and opens the side door, exposing Kelly and Guyrich 
              to the intense wind of the rotors. They cover their eyes, cowering. 
            </p>
            <p> KELLY&uml;&ordf;S P.O.V.</p>
            <p> Two figures come out of a hole in the mountain. One seems extremely 
              larger than the other.</p>
            <p> Guyrich and Kelly step out. As they get closer he can make out 
              Magneto and Sabretooth.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              Dear God... Dear... God.</p>
            <p> The Pilot removes his helmet to REVEAL:</p>
            <p> Pyro, smiling.</p>
            <p> KELLY (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              What the hell is this?</p>
            <p> Kelly is utterly confused. As Magneto nears, Guyrich steps forward 
              to greet him, putting arms around Magneto&uml;&ordf;s neck and kissing 
              him deeply. Then Magneto looks deep and lovingly into Guyrich&uml;&ordf;s 
              eyes.</p>
            <p> And with that GUY SHAPE SHIFTS into a beautiful woman who herefore 
              will be known as MYSTIQUE. Her body is covered in iridescent blue 
              scales, which complement her lovely, <br>
              solid yellow eyes.</p>
            <p> Kelly, of course, is shocked. Mystique shows a little hip, raising 
              the scales at her mid-section mockingly, as the last of what we 
              thought was Guyrich slips underneath.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              You mutant bastards...</p>
            <p> Pyro grabs the Senator as he runs back for the helicopter in vain.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              Whatever you do to me... no matter what you&uml;&ordf;ll make me 
              right. Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Gosh, I hope so.</p>
            <p> As Kelly struggles against all hope.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              People like you are the reason people like me exist.</p>
            <p> And with that, Mystique walks up.</p>
            <p> MYSTIQUE<br>
              And people like you are the reason I was afraid to go to school 
              as a child.</p>
            <p> With that, Mystique punches Kelly. Knocking him out cold.</p>
            <p> BLACK</p>
            <p> INT. MACHINE ROOM - MAGNETO&uml;&ordf;S LAIR - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Kelly comes to.</p>
            <p> Magneto walks past him, holding Logan&uml;&ordf;s dog tag.</p>
            <p> His thumb crushes one last time over the curious &uml;&not;Wolverine.?</p>
            <p> PULL OUT TO REVEAL:</p>
            <p> Kelly is strapped to a metal chair, bound impossibly tight. He 
              struggles. Mystique watches from the far side of the room.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Are you a &uml;&not;God-fearing man,? Senator?</p>
            <p> Kelly&uml;&ordf;s reaction tells him he is certainly afraid of 
              something right now.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              That term always confused me. As if there were something to fear.</p>
            <p> Kelly looks around wildly, terrified.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              God after all, is often defined as all- forgiving. A description 
              I rather like. I think what you really are afraid of...</p>
            <p> Magneto uses his mind to move Kelly&uml;&ordf;s chair a little 
              closer. Kelly nearly loses it. </p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              ...Is me and my kind. The Brotherhood of Mutants.</p>
            <p> He touches Kelly&uml;&ordf;s face and Kelly recoils.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              And this law. Your mutant registration act is only the beginning.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              The intention of registration act -</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              INTENTION? Intention, Senator? We are talking about mankind here. 
              His fear. It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded 
              into camps. Studied for weaknesses. And eventually wiped off the 
              face of the Earth.</p>
            <p> Kelly shakes his head. There is nothing he can say to sway this 
              man.</p>
            <p> Magneto turns and admires his machine.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Well, we&uml;&ordf;re much more giving than that. We simply want 
              to share with you... To help you understand.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              What is it you intend to do to me?</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              (smiling)<br>
              Let&uml;&ordf;s just say, God works too slowly.</p>
            <p> Magneto moves to the machine.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              You&uml;&ordf;re a leader, Senator Kelly -- you set an example. 
              And if more of you... were like more of us? Well, you&uml;&ordf;ll 
              see.</p>
            <p> Kelly watches as Magneto takes Logan&uml;&ordf;s dog tag and places 
              <br>
              it atop a tube at the bottom of a large spire in the center of the 
              room some thirty feet high.</p>
            <p> He walks toward the opposite side of the room and watches <br>
              as the tag is raised to the top of the device, through the shaft.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Don&uml;&ordf;t fear God, Senator. And certainly - most certainly... 
              don&uml;&ordf;t fear me.</p>
            <p> A beat.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Not any more.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> MAGNETO raises his arms and a series of metal rings up from the 
              machine platform that holds the dog tag. With a slight motion of 
              his hand, the rings begin to spin slowly gaining in speed as Magneto 
              controls it with his power.</p>
            <p> The air around it ripples, gaining in intensity.</p>
            <p> WAVES OF MAGNETIC ENERGY POURS from Magneto&uml;&ordf;s hands 
              toward the machine.</p>
            <p> Now, Magneto has the rings spinning around the dog tag at such 
              speed, the rings themselves are no longer visible - merely a blur 
              around the stationary tag. Magneto lowers his hands. The machine 
              is now working on its own.</p>
            <p> Kelly&uml;&ordf;s eyes grow wide with fear as the metal dog tag 
              begins to glow. Dull at first... the brightly... too brightly.</p>
            <p> The deafening whine of the machine builds louder and louder.</p>
            <p> Suddenly -- SILENCE</p>
            <p> FIVE SECONDS OF ABSOLUTE SILENCE.</p>
            <p> The sphere vanishes, enveloped in a light so white, it defies 
              description.</p>
            <p> But I&uml;&ordf;ll try:</p>
            <p> A light that seems to ooze rather than radiate. A light that fills 
              the room as it expands outward and engulfs everything in sight.</p>
            <p> It is liquid light. Creeping and unstoppable.</p>
            <p> From outside the room, Pyro and Sabretooth watch through <br>
              the window. It comes through, first casting its shadows darkly against 
              the wall, then erasing them as it swallows them - as though they 
              were never there.</p>
            <p> INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT</p>
            <p> From under a door, the light leaks in, filling the room.</p>
            <p> All through the lair, air vents, keyholes, drainpipes and the 
              like, the liquid light fills the lair to the gills.</p>

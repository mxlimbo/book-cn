            <p> The fence that surrounds the property has been bent and <br>
              buckled violently.</p>
            <p> INT. MANSION HALLWAY - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Xavier wheels down the hallway, pajama clad students are <br>
              milling about the halls. Their faces showing that they are afraid 
              to go back to their rooms. One GIRL, younger and smaller than the 
              others, seems particularly upset.</p>
            <p> Xavier wheels over to her and gently touches the side of her face.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              It&uml;&ordf;s going to be alright.</p>
            <p> She manages a faint smile. Then Xavier looks to the other students 
              -- their frightened faces.</p>
            <p> INT. LABORATORY - LATER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Beast reclines in his lab chair, a splint on his leg.</p>
            <p> Jean stands with Cyclops who watches through a new visor.</p>
            <p> Rogue sits off to the side, bearing the guilt. While Storm, her 
              neck badly bruised, stands near her.</p>
            <p> For the first time we have seen -- Charles Xavier is angry.</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              When Rogue left the mansion, they must have followed her.</p>
            <p> Xavier shuts his eyes furious.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              Yes... they wanted me out of the way. If I had been here... I...</p>
            <p> Xavier opens his eyes and sees Rogue sitting on a chair in the 
              corner. She is visibly upset. Xavier wheels over to Rogue. Xavier 
              reaches out and softly touches her clothing covered shoulder.</p>
            <p> XAVIER (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              This was not your fault. I knew there was a danger, I should have 
              never left the school.</p>
            <p> And with that he turns his wheelchair to the door.</p>
            <p> XAVIER (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              I am going to find Logan.</p>
            <p> Xavier leaves.</p>
            <p> INT. CEREBRO - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Xavier enters and wheels himself into the giant machine. It immediately 
              comes to life - lighting the room. The chrome skull cap descends 
              onto Xavier&uml;&ordf;s head.</p>
            <p> Xavier closes his eyes as the machine powers up.</p>
            <p> E.C.U. ON XAVIER&uml;&ordf;S EYES</p>
            <p> They fly open. And then a terrible noise. The sound of a well 
              tuned machine suddenly going horribly wrong. Xavier is in terrible 
              pain.</p>
            <p> His back arches and he falls from his chair onto the floor. He 
              struggles to reach for a fire alarm on the wall. His fingers stretch 
              until finally -- he pulls it.</p>
            <p> Warning bells wail. Xavier falls unconscious, convulsing.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: Cyclops and Jean as they burst into the room.</p>
            <p> INT. LABORATORY - LATER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Xavier lies asleep in a hospital bed. Several electrodes are taped 
              to his head. A screen next to the bed monitors his erratic brain 
              waves.</p>
            <p> Jean and the splinted Beast stare at the monitor following its 
              rhythm. Storm and Rogue stand at the foot of the bed. They are each 
              trying to hide their fear, and not doing a very good job of it. 
              Cyclops looks on, the stress shows on his face.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              What&uml;&ordf;s wrong with him?</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.</p>
            <p> BEAST<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;m in the process of running more tests. But it seems 
              that every minute that goes by he gets weaker.</p>
            <p> All are silent. Rogue looks to Beast with desperate <br>
              eyes.</p>
            <p> ROGUE<br>
              Can you help him?</p>
            <p> BEAST<br>
              I don&uml;&ordf;t know.</p>
            <p> Xavier lies in bed, motionless. </p>
            <p> INT. FRONT HALL - DAY</p>
            <p> Two huge wooden front doors -- morning light shines through the 
              jagged holes in the wood where the knobs had been pulled off. The 
              antique steel knobs lay twisted and mangled on the floor.</p>
            <p> The small girl from last night kneels in front of the door with 
              a dustpan, sweeping up the mess.</p>
            <p> Something catches her eye. She sits up and leans in closer to 
              the jagged hole in the door.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: The little girl -- light from the hole washes over her 
              face. Then suddenly the light is cut off, as if something is blocking 
              the hole.</p>
            <p> DOLLY IN: as the small girl steps back, a look of fascination 
              comes across her face. As if she sees something coming through the 
              hole. </p>
            <p> INT. CEREBRO - DAY</p>
            <p> Cyclops, Jean and Storm stand before the device. Beast rises awkwardly 
              on his splinted leg, his back to the open control panel.</p>
            <p> BEAST<br>
              It&uml;&ordf;s gone. The neuro-filter, someone removed it.</p>
            <p> Jean stands.</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              What does that mean?</p>
            <p> BEAST<br>
              The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite 
              <br>
              flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor&uml;&ordf;s mind. 
              It&uml;&ordf;s what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness 
              of millions.</p>
            <p> Cyclops steps away, pondering Beast&uml;&ordf;s words. He understands 
              the ramifications -- the damage that has been done to Xavier.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              Can the Professor repair his own mind?</p>
            <p> BEAST<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;m afraid without Cerebro&uml;&ordf;s help, he won&uml;&ordf;t 
              have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... 
              there&uml;&ordf;s no Cerebro.</p>
            <p> Jean is noticeably upset.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              He&uml;&ordf;s already losing control of his vitals. Respiratory. 
              Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter <br>
              by tomorrow morning, I&uml;&ordf;m afraid.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              We have to find Magneto.</p>
            <p> He exits. Jean follows him.</p>
            <p> INT. HALLWAY - DAY</p>
            <p> Cyclops is standing, motionless.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Are you all right?</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              No. I&uml;&ordf;m... I don&uml;&ordf;t know if we can do this without 
              Charles.</p>
            <p> Jean puts her hand lovingly to his face. Cyclops takes her hand.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              He put you in charge for a reason, Scott.</p>
            <p> She goes to kiss him.</p>
            <p> SMALL GIRL<br>
              Dr. Grey?...</p>
            <p> The small girl stands alone in the hallway.</p>
            <p> SMALL GIRL (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Someone is here to see you.</p>
            <p> Jean&uml;&ordf;s eyes widen -- and around the corner steps Senator 
              Kelly, wearing the clothing he had taken from the beach. He trembles 
              as though from a high fever. His body is covered with a layer of 
              sweat.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              Dr. Grey.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Senator?</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              How did you get in here?</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              Your front door was damaged... there <br>
              was a hole...</p>
            <p> Kelly makes a hole with his hands that is not much larger then 
              that of a coffee can.</p>
            <p> KELLY (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              ... I squeezed through.</p>
            <p> Kelly buckles in pain, but then catches himself.</p>
            <p> Jean and Cyclops rush to help him. Beast crutches himself out 
              to see what&uml;&ordf;s happening. </p>
            <p> Kelly notices Beast.</p>
            <p> KELLY (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              What in God&uml;&ordf;s name are you?</p>
            <p> BEAST<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;m Beast.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              Of course you are.</p>
            <p> INT. LABORATORY - LATER - DAY</p>
            <p> Xavier is in bed, eyes closed.</p>
            <p> Rogue holds vigil at his side.</p>
            <p> Kelly is in the bed next to him, trembling, burning up from what 
              seems to be a bad fever that keeps getting worse.</p>
            <p> Jean has a syringe in her hand and is swabbing some alcohol on 
              Kelly&uml;&ordf;s skin.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;m sorry to come here, Ms. Grey. I was afraid if I went 
              to a hospital, they would...</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              (interrupting)<br>
              Treat you like a mutant? We are not what you think. Not all of us.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              Tell it to the ones that did this to me.</p>
            <p> Jean looks closer at his hands.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              I don&uml;&ordf;t see these spikes you&uml;&ordf;re talking about. 
              I&uml;&ordf;m going to give you an antibiotic for the - Oh my God.</p>
            <p> Jean and Kelly both look as the cotton swab ignites like flash 
              paper in her hand. Everyone is shocked. Jean pauses and takes the 
              bottle of alcohol from the shelf. She pours a small amount on Kelly&uml;&ordf;s 
              arm and it instantly catches fire.</p>
            <p> INT. LABORATORY - LATER - DAY</p>
            <p> Rogue is still sitting in a chair, next to Xavier&uml;&ordf;s 
              bed -- Xavier&uml;&ordf;s opens his eyes. He looks at Rogue and 
              smiles softly.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              Hello, Rogue?</p>
            <p> Rogue almost jumps out of her chair with excitement.</p>
            <p> ROGUE<br>
              Hold on, I&uml;&ordf;ll get the others.</p>
            <p> Rogue exits. Xavier slowly looks over to Kelly lying in the bed 
              next to him. Both men are weak and getting weaker.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              Senator... Kelly?</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              Yes... Who are you?</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              I am Charles Xavier. This is my school.</p>
            <p> Kelly tries to speak, but his strength is waning.</p>
            <p> The two men are a pitiful sight, both slowly coming apart.</p>
            <p> XAVIER (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Can you tell me what happened to you?</p>
            <p> Kelly is in pain. It&uml;&ordf;s a struggle to speak.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              (weak, delirious)<br>
              I was kidnapped... They killed GUYRICH... mutants... There was a 
              light... a bright... light.</p>
            <p> Xavier turns to Kelly, looking deep into his eyes.</p>
            <p> He begins to PROBE KELLY&uml;&ordf;S MIND.</p>
            <p> INT. EXT. VARIOUS FLASHBACK - DAY/NIGHT</p>
            <p> FLASH</p>
            <p> The following is an audio-visual collage of Kelly&uml;&ordf;s 
              perspective from throughout the film, coming back to us in a new 
              order.</p>
            <p> THE CAGE OF SENATOR KELLY in Magneto&uml;&ordf;s lair. NOW HIS 
              <br>
              P.O.V. as seen by Xavier.</p>
            <p> Vision fades in and out in a sedated haze.</p>
            <p> He is laid out of a gurney.</p>
            <p> KELLY (V.O.)<br>
              Whatever you do to me... no matter what -- you&uml;&ordf;ll make 
              me right. Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.</p>
            <p> He looks up and sees Mystique wheeling the gurney, smiling down 
              at the Senator.</p>
            <p> MYSTIQUE (V.O.)<br>
              And people like you are the reason I was afraid to go to school 
              as a child.</p>
            <p> FLASH</p>
            <p> Kelly is looking around a large, sphered room. In the center is 
              the MACHINE.</p>
            <p> JEAN (V.O.)<br>
              The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.</p>
            <p> KELLY (V.O.)<br>
              I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.</p>
            <p> FLASH</p>
            <p> The DOG TAG as it is elevated into the machine.</p>
            <p> JEAN (V.O.)<br>
              In every organism on Earth there exits a mutator gene -- The X-factor. 
              The beginnings of another stage of evolution.</p>
            <p> SLOWLY BUILDING LIGHT, growing brighter and brighter.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (V.O.)<br>
              God works too slowly.</p>
            <p> Pull back as if the camera is pulling back through his eye, into 
              his head -- A MICROSCOPE&uml;&ordf;S VIEW OF HIS CELLS, <br>
              suddenly and violently disturbed.</p>
            <p> KELLY (V.O.)<br>
              What have you bastards done to me?</p>
            <p> CHILD&uml;&ordf;S VOICE (V.O.)<br>
              Mom, is that a mutant?</p>
            <p> Kelly&uml;&ordf;s reflection in the metal of the sink in his prison.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (V.O.)<br>
              You&uml;&ordf;re a leader Senator Kelly, you set an example...</p>
            <p> Blob&uml;&ordf;s face, burned by Kelly&uml;&ordf;s hands.</p>
            <p> Over the cliff.</p>
            <p> GUYRICH (V.O.)<br>
              ... A Demonstration of some kind?</p>
            <p> The venomous spike emerging from Kelly&uml;&ordf;s hands.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (V.O.)<br>
              Because if more of you... were like more of us... like more of us...</p>
            <p> GUYRICH (V.O.)<br>
              ... the UN summit... the whole world will be watching.</p>
            <p> KELLY (V.O.)<br>
              What is it you intend to do to me?</p>
            <p> The woman staring up at him on the beach.</p>
            <p> KELLY (V.O.)<br>
              Oh... Oh God... what have you done to me?</p>
            <p> The boy on the beach.</p>
            <p> JARRING FLASH</p>
            <p> KELLY (V.O.)<br>
              Dear God.... dear... God.</p>

              Welcome to the future... brother... The brotherhood of mutants.</p>
            <p> A VIOLENT COLLISION OF NOISE, IMAGE AND LIGHT AND THEN:</p>
            <p> Xavier&uml;&ordf;s eyes burst open.</p>
            <p> INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Rogue leads Storm, Jean, Beast and Cyclops quickly into the lab.</p>
            <p> Xavier is lying in his bed. Jean looks up at the screen above 
              him and sees Xavier&uml;&ordf;s brain waves have dropped severely.</p>
            <p> Kelly lies unconscious in his bed, his heart monitor weakening.</p>
            <p> Beast limps over to Xavier. Xavier struggles to speak. Beast bends 
              down so that Xavier can whisper into his ear.</p>
            <p> E.C.U. Xavier&uml;&ordf;s lips move as he tells Beast what he 
              knows.</p>
            <p> INT. LAB - LATER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Jean, Storm, Beast and Cyclops talk while the news plays silently 
              on the TV in the background.</p>
            <p> BEAST<br>
              It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers 
              the mutator gene in normal human beings. <br>
              And he is using Adamantium as its core.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              Its core?</p>
            <p> Beast grabs a wax pen and draws a lightbulb on a glass drawing 
              board.</p>
            <p> BEAST<br>
              Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb. He had the energy 
              source. He had the vacuum. But he didn&uml;&ordf;t have the filament. 
              He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              (nods -- now understanding)<br>
              ... until he found tungsten.</p>
            <p> Beast finishes his lightbulb by drawing the filament.</p>
            <p> BEAST<br>
              Correct... Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough 
              to hold the energy this machine produces. He used the Adamantium 
              in Logan&uml;&ordf;s dog tag to test it on the Senator. And I <br>
              assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan&uml;&ordf;s skeleton 
              for a larger demonstration.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              For what purpose?</p>
            <p> BEAST<br>
              Yes -- Only there&uml;&ordf;s a problem. The mutator gene is not 
              responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature. It&uml;&ordf;s 
              forcing the body&uml;&ordf;s cells to replicate thousands of times 
              faster than they&uml;&ordf;re accustomed to. The Senator&uml;&ordf;s 
              body is literally burning itself out. Scott -- this machine kills 
              people and I don&uml;&ordf;t think Magneto realizes it.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              So where do you think he&uml;&ordf;s planning <br>
              this larger demonstration?</p>
            <p> Jean looks down and sees Xavier pointing with a trembling <br>
              hand, trying to speak.</p>
            <p> Xavier is pointing to the television.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              There...</p>
            <p> He is looking at yet another report on Ellis Island.</p>
            <p> Cyclops and Jean walk over. All they see on the TV is an <br>
              aerial shot of Manhattan, slowly coming around toward the <br>
              harbor.</p>
            <p> The television image is from the P.O.V. of a helicopter circling 
              Ellis Island, taking in all the security and construction. The grand 
              main hall to Ellis Island and finally, what the helicopter sees 
              as it comes around for one more pass.</p>
            <p> SUDDENLY - The sound of Kelly&uml;&ordf;s heart monitor begins 
              to <br>
              PICK UP SPEED. Jean rushes to Kelly and touches his pale <br>
              neck. She draws her hand back quickly as if burned. The heart monitor 
              keeps speeding up until it is racing faster than a human heart could 
              possibly produce.</p>
            <p> Jean backs away helplessly.</p>
            <p> The sheet that covers Kelly&uml;&ordf;s body begins to flatten 
              out. The sweat covering the hapless Senator&uml;&ordf;s body thickens 
              into a viscous, clear liquid and begins to run off the table. Kelly 
              is literally melting away. Cyclops holds Jean as she turns away.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: THE TV -- the gathering leaders of the world, the water 
              clogged with boats, and the thousands of onlookers on Manhattan 
              Island. All well within range.INT. READY ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Storm finishes preparing to leave in another section of the ready 
              room. Beast stands by on his Beast-size crutches feeling useless.</p>
            <p> BEAST<br>
              I wish I could go.</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              We all do.</p>
            <p> BEAST<br>
              Storm. Try to look for the highest vantage point. <br>
              From what I can figure, he&uml;&ordf;ll need to gain as much altitude 
              as possible to blanket the island. It is my feeling that Magneto 
              has to--</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              Beast.</p>
            <p> Beast looks at her.</p>
            <p> STORM (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              We&uml;&ordf;ll be fine.</p>
            <p> INT. LAB - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Cyclops stands looking down at Professor Xavier. He starts to 
              walk away but he is stopped. He looks down and sees that the Professor 
              has weakly grabbed his sleeve. Cyclops looks at Xavier but he is 
              still unconscious. His hand falls back to the bed.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              You can still hear me... can&uml;&ordf;t you.</p>
            <p> Xavier lies still.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              I want to thank you for taking me in. Taking us in... You have taught 
              me everything in my life that is worth knowing.</p>
            <p> Cyclops grimly regards Xavier.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              And I want you to know that I&uml;&ordf;ll take care of them.</p>
            <p> INT. READY ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Cyclops and Jean get into their uniforms.</p>
            <p> Jean is about to go to the hanger when Cyclops stops her.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              Hey. I&uml;&ordf;m sorry. About Logan. I was jealous.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              (putting her arms around him)<br>
              Well, I think that&uml;&ordf;s perfectly understandable.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;ll tell you one thing though.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              What&uml;&ordf;s that?</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              He calls me sport one more time, and I&uml;&ordf;ll blow a watermelon-sized 
              hole through him.</p>
            <p> She smiles and kisses him.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Now let&uml;&ordf;s go get him.</p>
            <p> INT. X-JET - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Cyclops, Storm, and Jean board the X-Jet. They find -- ROGUE, 
              strapped into a seat, ready to go.</p>
            <p> INT. HANGER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> ROGUE stands outside the jet, obviously having been kicked off.</p>
            <p> INT. X-JET - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Jean reaches out a hand. Cyclops takes it. They squeeze tight. 
              The X-Jet&uml;&ordf;s engines begin to fire up.</p>
            <p> INT. HANGER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The hatch slowly starts to swing closed. From where she stands 
              Rogue debates, and then runs, dashing inside as the hatch to the 
              X-Jet closes behind her.</p>
            <p> EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A basketball sits on the ground near the middle of the court.</p>
            <p> Suddenly the asphalt starts to vibrate and the basketball rolls 
              a few inches.</p>
            <p> THEN: There is a grinding noise and the surface begins to separate 
              at the half court line. The basketball falls through the widening 
              hole and bounces off the wing of the rising X-Jet.</p>
            <p> LIFT-OFF. The jet turns and clears the hanger before blasting 
              off into the night sky.</p>

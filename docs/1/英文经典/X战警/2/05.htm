            <p> Senator Kelly&uml;&ordf;s helicopter, which has obviously been 
              pilfered for Magneto&uml;&ordf;s use, lands.</p>
            <p> Magneto, Sabretooth, Pyro, Mystique (no Toad) all climb out, having 
              returned from their ill-fated attempt to get Logan.</p>
            <p> INT. HALLWAY - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Kelly peers down the hall where we first went on our way to meet 
              Magneto.</p>
            <p> Kelly, with only that way to go, does so, passing once again the 
              odd assortment of machines, very reminiscent of the one he was exposed 
              to.</p>
            <p> He hears voices coming toward him and he looks around wildly, 
              wondering what to do. Shadows foretell the arrival of the brotherhood 
              headed this way.</p>
            <p> Kelly turns to run back from where he cam from.</p>
            <p> INT. HALLWAY - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Magneto and Sabretooth come walking from the other end of <br>
              the hall and pass the very spot where we just saw Kelly. No sign 
              of him.</p>
            <p> INT. CELL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> From which Kelly has escaped. The bars bend to make room <br>
              for Magneto as he walks into the room.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              How are we feeling today, Senator? <br>
              Advanced, I hope...</p>
            <p> But he freezes when he actually enters the room.</p>
            <p> First, he sees that Blob is laying on the floor with a purple, 
              welt-like hand print across his face. It is blistered and hideous. 
              Blob is gasping for air.</p>
            <p> Magneto looks and sees the cell is empty. He looks at <br>
              Sabretooth.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              I want him alive.</p>
            <p> SABRETOOTH<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;ll find him.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              ALIVE.</p>
            <p> And Sabretooth bolts back from where they came.</p>
            <p> EXT. MAGNETO&uml;&ordf;S LAIR - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Kelly hits the fresh air, looking around wildly. He runs for the 
              edge of a cliff high over the ocean.</p>
            <p> He raises his hands, we see his palms are covered with those wicked 
              spines and they are dripping a venomous fluid not too different 
              in color from the wound on Blob&uml;&ordf;s face.</p>
            <p> But then suddenly, something is wrong. Kelly buckles, clutching 
              his stomach again. He squelches what would have been a scream of 
              agony.</p>
            <p> He looks at his palms and the spikes are gone.</p>
            <p> Kelly hears footsteps. Suddenly out of the darkness Sabretooth 
              barrels toward him.</p>
            <p> Kelly turns and LEAPS. Sabretooth comes to the edge of the cliff.</p>
            <p> When he looks over, Kelly&uml;&ordf;s body has vanished. Swallowed 
              <br>
              by the sea.</p>
            <p> Only his clothes remain on the rocks below.</p>
            <p> INT. LOGAN&uml;&ordf;S ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Jean shows Logan the simple dorm cube with a bed and a small desk. 
              Jean opens the door for Logan and he inspects the sparse surroundings 
              grimly. Cyclops stands just outside the door - eavesdropping.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Anything else I can get you?</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Some cigars. Case of beer.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              There&uml;&ordf;s no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              I won&uml;&ordf;t light the cigars - how about <br>
              that?</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;ll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep. Even 
              with your healing ability, you&uml;&ordf;re going to be hurting 
              for a while.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              What if I like the pain?</p>
            <p> Jean doesn&uml;&ordf;t know what to make of that. She is about 
              to leave, then pauses.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used 
              the word mercenary.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Yeah? Well I don&uml;&ordf;t like to talk about my past.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              By reading my thoughts?</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              If necessary.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              (smirks)<br>
              What if they&uml;&ordf;re naughty?</p>
            <p> Jean smiles politely at his knowing glance.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Get some shut-eye, slick.</p>
            <p> She shuts the door.</p>
            <p> INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Jean hesitates at the door, thinking. Smiling. She turns and only 
              then does she realize Cyclops is standing there.</p>
            <p> She is startled.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Scott.. I -</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              I don&uml;&ordf;t like him being here.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              What are you talking about?</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              You saw what happened tonight. You think Magneto won&uml;&ordf;t 
              come after him again. You think he won&uml;&ordf;t come here if 
              necessary. This is a school, for God&uml;&ordf;s sake.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it&uml;&ordf;s 
              our responsibility to do something.</p>
            <p> Cyclops shakes his head.</p>
            <p> JEAN (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              What&uml;&ordf;s wrong? There&uml;&ordf;s something else bothering 
              you. </p>
            <p> Cyclops gets closer to Jean. She puts her hand on his chest.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              I have a bad feeling about this.</p>
            <p> Jean leans in slowly and kisses Cyclops just beside his mouth</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              You know I love you, Scott.</p>
            <p> Cyclops pulls her close. The hold each other.</p>
            <p> INT. LOGAN&uml;&ordf;S ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> E.C.U. Logan&uml;&ordf;s ear. His super-sensitive hearing has 
              picked up the whole conversation.</p>
            <p> Logan looks over on the bed and sees a new sketchbook and <br>
              several pencils.</p>
            <p> A small note is attached.</p>
            <p> <br>
              I hope you don&uml;&ordf;t mind. I understand this helps you relax.<br>
              <br>
              - X</p>
            <p> Logan shakes his head.</p>
            <p> INT. XAVIER&uml;&ordf;S OFFICE - LATER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A white light board. Beast&uml;&ordf;s blue furry hand slides 
              a long, full-body x-ray in place.</p>
            <p> Beast is showing Logan&uml;&ordf;s x-rays to Cyclops, Storm, Jean 
              and Xavier.</p>
            <p> BEAST<br>
              Adamantium. Until today I thought it to be a myth. mpenetrable, 
              <br>
              unbendable, resistant to the most extreme heat, cold, indestructible.</p>
            <p> Beast points to the x-ray.</p>
            <p> BEAST (CONT'D)<br>
              It&uml;&ordf;s been grafted to his entire <br>
              skeleton.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              He also has accelerated healing abilities - uncharted regenerative 
              <br>
              capability, making his age impossible to determine. He could very 
              well be older than I am.</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              Is the Adamantium part of his mutation?</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              No. Someone put it there, relying on his healing abilities to keep 
              him alive.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              What do you think Magneto wants with him?</p>
            <p> Xavier wheels himself to the window, starring out, deep in thought.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;m not entirely sure it&uml;&ordf;s &uml;&not;him? that 
              Magneto wants.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: X-ray of Logan&uml;&ordf;s Adamantium skeleton.</p>
            <p> INT. MANSION - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Rogue. The waifish young thing who hides so well in the <br>
              shadows seems more comfortable to be moving through the <br>
              mansion at night.</p>
            <p> She passes through the halls and rooms not making a sound <br>
              in her strangely-swathed body suit.</p>
            <p> INT. LOGAN&uml;&ordf;S ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> She creaks a door open slowly, letting a shaft of dim light slice 
              the darkness.</p>
            <p> The light shines across a nightstand. Rogue stares down at the 
              notepad, a sketch it. It is of an animal, small but fierce - a wolverine.</p>
            <p> She walks in to a figure laying in the bed and stands over him. 
              Over Logan.</p>
            <p> He lays under a single sheet, sweating, his eyes moving quickly 
              this way and that in R.E.M. His hands twitch.</p>
            <p> Rogue leans closer.</p>
            <p> PUSH IN ON LOGAN&uml;&ordf;S EYES AS THEY MOVE UNDER THE LIDS.</p>
            <p> FLASH - DREAM SEQUENCE</p>
            <p> INT. MILITARY LAB - THE PAST - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Like none we have ever seen thus far. In fact, judging by most 
              of the instruments here, we are looking at a laboratory some fifty 
              years old.</p>
            <p> Logan looks down and we can see his body, naked, strapped <br>
              to a table.</p>
            <p> A hand puts a mask over his mouth and -</p>
            <p> BLACK</p>
            <p> He awakens -</p>
            <p> STILL LOGAN&uml;&ordf;S P.O.V.</p>
            <p> He struggles weakly with restraints as doctors in lab coats and 
              thick, red rubber gloves stand over him taking notes, paying very 
              little attention to him at all.</p>
            <p> On the other side of the room is a huge vat filled with some kind 
              of molten metal. At the base of the vat is a giant electromagnet 
              <br>
              generating a huge gyroscope which created enormous friction energy 
              - the apparent source of the intense heat for melting the metal 
              in the vat.</p>
            <p> AGAIN THE MASK PUTS HIM UNDER AND:</p>
            <p> BLACK</p>
            <p> Awake again, but this time sinking into water - restrained completely 
              now.</p>
            <p> Logan looks down and gets only a glance of his body, seeing that 
              he is a series of incisions from head to toe - literally split open 
              - the flesh held back with hundreds of clamps.</p>
            <p> HE SINKS INTO THE STRANGE LIQUID - LIKE WATER BUT THICK <br>
              AND VISCOUS.</p>
            <p> And the sound of a DROWNING SCREAM.</p>
            <p> AND THE METAL IS POURED IN AFTER HIM.</p>
            <p> THE SOUND OF MOLTEN METAL HITTING LIQUID IS UNNERVING. <br>
              Mixed with screams, it is unbearable.</p>
            <p> INT. LOGAN&uml;&ordf;S ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> SCREAMING</p>
            <p> Logan&uml;&ordf;s screaming as he comes to.</p>
            <p> Logan&uml;&ordf;s eyes FLASH OPEN. He looks up and sees a figure 
              <br>
              looming over him. In a flash he reacts.</p>
            <p> THUD. Nothing more. Then silence.</p>
            <p> The door bursts open and Cyclops stands in the doorway <br>
              shocked. Frozen. Jean is next and finally Storm. They can only stare.</p>
            <p> Logan sits upright in bed, CLAWS EXTENDED, INTO ROGUE&uml;&ordf;S 
              <br>
              CHEST. She is literally frozen at the end of his arm. </p>
            <p> Finally, Cyclops breaks the silence and moves to grab her.</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              DON&uml;&ordf;T TOUCH HER.</p>
            <p> Cyclops freezes.</p>
            <p> Logan finally pulls his claws free and retracts them. Rogue staggers, 
              she pitches forward and touches his face gently with her hands, 
              as though she would like him to be the last thing she sees on this 
              Earth.</p>
            <p> Logan and Rogue, locked in a fatal moment of tenderness <br>
              snaring a look of loneliness that only they can understand.</p>
            <p> But suddenly, Logan seems to change.</p>
            <p> And before he can say another word, he begins to tremble, then 
              he starts to howl in pain.</p>
            <p> Rogue SNAPS BACK, mouth open in a gaping, silent scream. <br>
              What sound comes out does not match the expression at all. Merely 
              a gasp, like steam escaping. Through the huge slash in her clothes, 
              we see the wound on her chest slowly vanish.</p>
            <p> Before long, she transforms back into a healthy young girl with 
              no sign of injury.</p>
            <p> Then, her escaping breath begins to accelerate, much in the way 
              Logan&uml;&ordf;s did - too much like Logan&uml;&ordf;s did. It 
              is as if she has taken in his trait of berserker rage. Soon she 
              is smashing things all around her. One hand rakes the wallpaper 
              like claws.</p>
            <p> Finally, she gets a hold of herself, becoming the introverted 
              Rogue we all know so well.</p>
            <p> Then she stands slowly, looks at the others.</p>
            <p> And she runs from the room. Storm runs after her.</p>
            <p> The rest turn to Logan, who lays on the floor, convulsing.</p>
            <p> Jean goes to help him. She looks back at Cyclops. His expression 
              makes it clear that his worst fears about Logan have come to pass.</p>
            <p> EXT. PUBLIC BEACH - DAY</p>
            <p> A familiar scene of suburban escapism. Crowded enough that most 
              people can move about unnoticed.</p>
            <p> In fact, most people do not notice the very large jellyfish shooting 
              through the water at remarkable speed. <br>
              And only a few notice the COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT MAN emerging from 
              the water.</p>
            <p> It is Senator Kelly, and he resembles in many ways a jellyfish. 
              His skin and innards are clear and gooey. It is only when he comes 
              completely and naked out of the water that he returns to somewhat 
              normal.</p>
            <p> He walks up to the beach and people recoil from the very sight 
              of him. Pointing, whispering. Then just laughing at the naked man.</p>
            <p> Kelly grabs a towel off an empty chair, a Hawaiian shirt off another.</p>
            <p> Suddenly, he buckles, grabbing his stomach and lurching away in 
              terrible pain.</p>
            <p> He barely pauses when he hears a child&uml;&ordf;s voice in semiwhisper:</p>
            <p> CHILD&uml;&ordf;S VOICE<br>
              Mom, is that a mutant?</p>
            <p> INT. HALLWAY - DUSK</p>
            <p> Storm and Logan walk down the hall. Logan is wearing sweats. He 
              has obviously just woken up. The sun is low in the horizon and the 
              hall is suffused with an orange glow.</p>
            <p> Students pass by them. By now, the students have heard rumors 
              about what happened the night before. They watch Logan fearfully 
              as they pass by him.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Why is everybody up at sunrise?</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              The sun is setting, Logan. You&uml;&ordf;ve been asleep for nineteen 
              hours.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              What did she do to me?</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              She borrowed your power to save her life. When she touches someone, 
              she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts. In your case -- your 
              ability to heal. That&uml;&ordf;s why she keeps her body covered.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              I felt like she almost killed me.</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              If she held on any longer she could have.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              And you think it helps calling her Rogue?</p>
            <p> Storm shakes her head, but remains patient.</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              We&uml;&ordf;ve learned to embrace what we are rather than hide 
              it like an <br>
              affliction. For some, it has become their identity. You mock the 
              names these people choose but they wear them as badges of pride.</p>
            <p> They arrive at the door to the gym.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS (O.S.)<br>
              I wanted to talk to you.</p>
            <p> Logan turns and sees Cyclops.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Storm, would you excuse us please?</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              Of course.</p>
            <p> She exits.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              Let&uml;&ordf;s take a walk.</p>
            <p> Cyclops begins to walk away in the other direction.</p>
            <p> Logan just watches him go. After a moment, he decides it might 
              be more interesting to see where this is going. He follows. They 
              walk across the hall to:</p>
            <p> INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> On first glance, the gym looks really average. A fairly standard 
              boxing ring in the middle. A fairly standard weight set nearby.</p>
            <p> Then you notice the weights themselves are abnormally large.</p>
            <p> 100. 200. 300. 400 pounds. All the way up to 2000. And that is 
              just one stack.</p>
            <p> Cyclops enters first with Logan coming in behind him.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              How long have you been in Alaska?</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              I don&uml;&ordf;t remember. Is that what you wanted to ask me?</p>
            <p> Logan is barely through the door when Cyclops whips around on 
              Logan and thumps his finger into his chest.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              I just wanted to make you clear on something. Personally, I don&uml;&ordf;t 
              care what Magneto wants with you. He can take those claws of yours 
              and use them for Barbecue skewers. What I do care about is the safety 
              of this group. The Professor is in harge, and after the Professor, 
              there&uml;&ordf;s me. So, for the remainder of your time here, you&uml;&ordf;re 
              going to keep that killer instinct of yours locked down so no one 
              else gets hurt.</p>
            <p> Beat.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              (smirks)<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;ve served with men like you before. Methodical. Systematic 
              -- Naive. You know what happens to those men in a real fight?</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              You know, you --</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Shut up. I got no interest in you, Xavier, (he points mockingly 
              at the X&uml;&ordf;s on Cyclops&uml;&ordf; uniform) or your... X-Men.</p>
            <p> Logan takes him in for a moment.</p>
            <p> LOGAN (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              And I don&uml;&ordf;t think this has anything to do with my &uml;&not;killer 
              instinct.? You just don&uml;&ordf;t like the way I&uml;&ordf;m looking 
              at your girl -- Or maybe you don&uml;&ordf;t like the way she&uml;&ordf;s 
              looking back. And maybe you think you&uml;&ordf;re man enough to 
              do something about it.</p>
            <p> Cyclops is enraged. A red light begins to glow around the edge 
              of his visor and the ruby-quartz lens brightens. We can faintly 
              hear the low hum of immense power that is now barely ontained. Before 
              Cyclops can even react, Logan puts his fist against Cyclops&uml;&ordf; 
              throat. SHOOK! Logan extends one claw up one side of Cyclops&uml;&ordf; 
              neck. He smiles.</p>
            <p> LOGAN (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              C&uml;&ordf;mon sport. You think you can blow the meat off my bones 
              before I gut you? Let&uml;&ordf;s find out.</p>
            <p> The air is now charged with tension. The two men are about to 
              attack when-</p>
            <p> XAVIER (O.S.)<br>
              Cyclops!</p>
            <p> Logan whirls and sees Xavier regarding them sternly. <br>
              Logan turns his building anger on Xavier.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              I have a question for you, Chuck. <br>
              What&uml;&ordf;s the point?</p>
            <p> Xavier sits calmly as Logan, claws still extended, marches over 
              to him.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              The point of what?</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              This. This whole God damn thing.<br>
              (derisively, at Cyclops)<br>
              Making yourselves into some sort of &uml;&not;team? of super-powered 
              freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature. For 
              what?</p>
            <p> Logan continues to advance on Xavier. Cyclops moves to stop Logan, 
              but Xavier waves him off.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              The point is to step into a more evolved position of social <br>
              responsibility. To recognize that there is a world out there and 
              that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              What if it never happens? What if they&uml;&ordf;re so afraid of 
              us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant 
              cemetery.</p>
            <p> Xavier has heard this argument before.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              Now that&uml;&ordf;s Magneto talking.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              No. That&uml;&ordf;s me talking. And you know what? It&uml;&ordf;s 
              only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this 
              guy wants with me.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.</p>
            <p> Logan raises his hand to his chest grasping for something that 
              no longer hangs from his neck.</p>
            <p> XAVIER (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              You&uml;&ordf;re thinking of your dog tag. It was made of Adamantium 
              wasn&uml;&ordf;t it?</p>
            <p> JEAN (O.S.)<br>
              Professor.</p>
            <p> Logan turns and sees Jean walking towards them.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              What is it?</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Rogue&uml;&ordf;s missing.</p>
            <p> Logan looks at Jean with concern.</p>
            <p> INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A long, dark subterranean corridor with gleaming walls and floor. 
              Well lit and strangely echoless.</p>
            <p> Logan follows Xavier, who are in turn followed by Storm, <br>
              Cyclops and Jean to a thick steel door at the end of the <br>
              hall.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Where are we going?</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              To find Rogue.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              How?</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the 
              average human being.</p>
            <p> At Xavier&uml;&ordf;s eye level is a black screen with a chin-rest 
              like you see at the eye doctor. Xavier rests his head in it and 
              the screen lights up.</p>
            <p> XAVIER (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Cerebro amplifies my power. It allows me to browse the world&uml;&ordf;s 
              consciousness and find the genetically enhanced.</p>
            <p> A vertical beam scans across his eye and a picture of Xavier&uml;&ordf;s 
              retina appears on the screen next to a computerized image of the 
              same. The two images overlap and match perfectly.</p>
            <p> XAVIER (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              This is how I found you.</p>
            <p> A small beep and a loud KNOCK of tumblers rolling and the <br>
              vault door opens.</p>
            <p> They walk inside.</p>

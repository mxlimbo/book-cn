            </p>
            <p> THROUGH THE TURRET ATOP THE LAIR, the light beams up into the 
              night sky, shinning like a beacon for miles.</p>
            <p> Then the white light obscures all. Fueled by this tiny piece of 
              metal, the light extends like an ever growing bubble, out and up 
              over the ocean.</p>
            <p> PULL BACK FROM THE SMALL ISLAND</p>
            <p> The bubble of white light is easily five miles across.</p>
            <p> INT. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Kelly grits his teeth, barely visible in the whiteness.</p>
            <p> Then it is gone. He hangs his head in exhaustion.</p>
            <p> Magneto himself is a bit overwhelmed. He looks at his own skin 
              - no apparent change. He shakes his head, blinks his eyes.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth and Pyro are also a bit struck by the display and they 
              also seem a bit dazed.</p>
            <p> Magneto walks over and reaches into the still steaming metal device. 
              His hand comes out holding the dog tag actually its remains.</p>
            <p> A frazzled, blackened wire, warped and spent. Nothing more. And 
              this turns to dust in his fingers.</p>
            <p> Magneto has amazed even himself this time.</p>
            <p> The silence is shattered by a phone ringing. Sabretooth picks 
              it up. He listens, then hands the phone to Magneto.</p>
            <p> SABRETOOTH<br>
              We&uml;&ordf;ve found him.</p>
            <p> Magneto puts the phone to his ear. He smiles.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Where?</p>
            <p> ANGLE on Kelly, his skin glistening slightly, almost luminescent. 
              Pinker (healthier?) then it was when he came in.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              Oh... Oh God... what have you done to me?</p>
            <p> Magneto hangs up the phone. He crosses to Kelly, leans in and 
              whispers in his ear.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Welcome to the future... brother.</p>
            <p> Magneto stands, looks at his machine, then back at Kelly.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Now if you&uml;&ordf;ll excuse me... I have a train to catch.</p>
            <p> EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The silver Amtrack moves speedily through the dark countryside.</p>
            <p> INT. TRAIN - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A CONDUCTOR makes his way through a half filled car of <br>
              commuters taking tickets. He passes a restroom and exits the car. 
              He takes a seat.</p>
            <p> Logan emerges from the restroom, having avoided paying his fare.</p>
            <p> A few seats in front of him, in a grouping of seats that face 
              one another, sit four large guys, early twenties -- They&uml;&ordf;re 
              the guys from your college named Brad that used to get drunk and 
              try to drown freshmen in the toilets. We&uml;&ordf;ll call them 
              BRADS 1, 2, 3, and 4. They are drinking from beer cans in paper 
              bags.</p>
            <p> Across the aisle from them sits a lone oddly pretty twenty year 
              old girl. Her name is ROGUE -- a dark-eyed and somewhat distant 
              creature. From the shawl around her head to her boots, layers of 
              odd clothing wrap every inch of her body, except her face and hands. 
              She looks worn, it is the face of a runaway. Next to her, a dirty 
              duffle bag.</p>
            <p> The Brads are staring at Rogue, making lewd comments about her. 
              They have obviously been drinking for awhile.</p>
            <p> BRAD 1<br>
              Hey.</p>
            <p> Rogue looks at him, then quickly looks away.</p>
            <p> BRAD 1 (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Hey... Hey I&uml;&ordf;m talking to you.</p>
            <p> The Brads laugh amongst themselves at her reaction.</p>
            <p> BRAD 2<br>
              (looking at her duffle bag)<br>
              Where are you going?</p>
            <p> BRAD 1<br>
              Awww... look guys she&uml;&ordf;s shy.</p>
            <p> BRAD 3<br>
              Maybe that&uml;&ordf;s why she&uml;&ordf;s alone. Is that why you&uml;&ordf;re 
              alone?</p>
            <p> Brad 4, who is closest to Rogue, leans toward her.</p>
            <p> BRAD 4<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;ll keep you company.</p>
            <p> Rogue is silent and turns her back on him, trying to ignore him.</p>
            <p> BRAD 4 (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Hey... I&uml;&ordf;m talking to you.</p>
            <p> Rogue continues to ignore him. This gets Brad 4 angry. The other 
              Brads watch his failure and laugh.</p>
            <p> BRAD 4 (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              (louder)<br>
              I said I&uml;&ordf;m talking to you!</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: Logan, his ears picking up everything.</p>
            <p> Rogue looks down trying not to look at them.</p>
            <p> Brad 4 will not be ignored. He reaches out to the one place which 
              is not covered by clothing that he can reach--Rogue&uml;&ordf;s 
              hand lying at her side.</p>
            <p> BRAD 4 (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              (louder still)<br>
              I said...!</p>
            <p> He grabs her hand.</p>
            <p> Suddenly, Brad 4&uml;&ordf;s eyes open wide as if he&uml;&ordf;s 
              in shock, an <br>
              instant later, he COLLAPSES.</p>
            <p> Rogue reels back.</p>
            <p> Brad&uml;&ordf;s 1, 2, and 3 stand up, they are angry.</p>
            <p> BRAD 1<br>
              Hey, what did you do?</p>
            <p> ROGUE<br>
              Don&uml;&ordf;t touch me.</p>
            <p> Rogue stands, frightened and confused. Brad blocks her in.</p>
            <p> BRAD 3<br>
              Hey Brad, she&uml;&ordf;s a mutant!</p>
            <p> Rogue moves to get away, but Brad 1 shoves Rogue. Rogue <br>
              falls to the floor of the train, right next to Logan&uml;&ordf;s 
              feet. Brad 1 moves toward her.</p>
            <p> Suddenly, Logan steps in front of Brad 1.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              How about you sit down and leave the kid alone, alright?</p>
            <p> BRAD 1<br>
              She&uml;&ordf;s a mutant.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Yeah, well, nobody&uml;&ordf;s perfect.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: Rogue, she gets up and huddles toward the rear <br>
              of the train.</p>
            <p> BRAD 1<br>
              (who is considerably larger than Logan)<br>
              I think you should take a seat little fella.</p>
            <p> He shoves Logan backward. Logan gathers himself. Brad 4 is very 
              weak but regaining consciousness. </p>
            <p> Brads 2 and 3 stand to back their friend against Logan. <br>
              It&uml;&ordf;s now three against one. All the passengers are watching 
              --</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Listen -- I don&uml;&ordf;t want any trouble.</p>
            <p> BRAD 1<br>
              Well you got trouble.</p>
            <p> Brad 1 slams his fist into Logan&uml;&ordf;s stomach. Logan grabs 
              the man&uml;&ordf;s fist and lifts him up and over, slamming him 
              into the train floor.</p>
            <p> Brad 2 grabs a commuter&uml;&ordf;s briefcase and smashes it on 
              Logan&uml;&ordf;s head. Bursting open, its contents fly everywhere.</p>
            <p> Logan turns. Brad 2 stares wide-eyed as the gash on Logan&uml;&ordf;s 
              head starts to heal.</p>
            <p> Suddenly, Brad 1 is up. He grabs Logan around the neck <br>
              from behind. He holds Logan in his head lock while Brad <br>
              2 and 3 start punching him in the stomach and face. Logan is taking 
              quite a beating and naturally the entire train of people are doing 
              nothing. </p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: Logan&uml;&ordf;s eyes, his pupils are getting smaller. 
              <br>
              His brow furrows like a wolf. A low guttural GROWL.</p>
            <p> Suddenly rage -- PRIMAL RAGE</p>
            <p> Logan&uml;&ordf;s feet kick out, his left foot strikes Brad 1 
              in the face knocking him backward, while his right foot hooks around 
              Brad 2&uml;&ordf;s head dragging him forward. With his left hand 
              Logan grabs Brad 2 by the throat, squeezing the esophagus.</p>
            <p> Brad 2 is paralyzed. His eyes roll up as the oxygen is cut off. 
              Brad 2 collapses.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: Brad 3 running out of the car with the other <br>
              passengers. A TRANSIT COP pushes past the fleeing passengers, into 
              the car.</p>
            <p> Brad 1 still bear hugs Logan from behind. Logan reaches <br>
              pushing his knuckles against Brad 1&uml;&ordf;s leg. Suddenly:</p>
            <p> SHOOK -- the sound of metal extending. Brad 1 howls in <br>
              pain. SHOOK -- the sound of metal retracting.</p>
            <p> Brad 1 releases Logan and stares down at three punctured <br>
              holes in his leg. Logan wheels around, kicks him to the <br>
              floor, and punches him.</p>
            <p> All eyes in the train are on Logan, as he raises his fist.</p>
            <p> SHOOK -- Logan extends his claws.</p>
            <p> Logan is at the peak of his rage. The passengers stare in disbelief. 
              Even Rogue is astonished.</p>
            <p> TRANSIT COP<br>
              Freeze... transit police. Drop your weapon.</p>
            <p> Logan pauses, only for a second. Brad 1 is wailing for his life.</p>
            <p> But rage has taken over. Logan raises his blades to finish what 
              he started.</p>
            <p> Suddenly, THE TRAIN LURCHES VIOLENTLY. Logan goes flying <br>
              backward.</p>
            <p> EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The train has been brought to a sudden stop -- but the wheels 
              are still turning. Finally, they are shut down.</p>
            <p> INT. TRAIN CAR - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The lights are out. Everyone gathers themselves. Then comes a 
              low grinding creak. The sound of metal bending. Rivets popping.</p>
            <p> EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Like the top of a sardine can, the entire side wall of the train 
              car is peeled off. Revealing the terrified passengers inside -- 
              and Magneto, Sabretooth, Mystique Toad and Pyro on the outside. 
              With a final thrust, the air RIPPLES and Magneto tosses the car 
              wall to the side.</p>
            <p> Passengers from the other cars stare wide-eyed out their windows. 
              The train has stopped at a railroad crossing, the gates are down.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              You can come out now, Logan. You&uml;&ordf;re among friends.</p>
            <p> The transit cop rises to his feet, brandishing his pistol.</p>
            <p> TRANSIT COP<br>
              Freeze!</p>
            <p> With a turn of his finger, Magneto draws the pistol to him. The 
              cop holds tight and is yanked off the train, onto the ground. With 
              another twist of his hand, Magneto makes the gun leap from the cop&uml;&ordf;s 
              grasp and HOVER, pointing at the cop&uml;&ordf;s head.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              You Homo Sapiens and your guns.</p>
            <p> The gun cocks.</p>
            <p> XAVIER (O.S.)<br>
              That&uml;&ordf;s enough, Max!</p>
            <p> All turn to see Xavier, seated in his wheelchair -- <br>
              flanked by Cyclops, Jean and Storm. All, save Xavier, are in uniform.</p>
            <p> THUNDER RUMBLES ACROSS THE SKY</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: Storm, a GUST OF WIND.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;ll never understand your regard for them, Charles.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              And I&uml;&ordf;ll never understand terrorists.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              I am trying to save our kind, Charles. <br>
              You should do the same.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              Not at the cost of lives, Max.</p>
            <p> Xavier&uml;&ordf;s metal chair is gripped by magnetic forces. 
              It shakes and begins to inch towards Magneto.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Magneto.</p>
            <p> The chair is pulled closer to Magneto. Cyclops steps forward. 
              Xavier need not turn to know help is coming.</p>
            <p> Magneto sees and respects Cyclops&uml;&ordf;s power. The chair 
              stops moving.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              (to Cyclops)<br>
              It&uml;&ordf;s alright... it&uml;&ordf;s alright.</p>
            <p> Magneto glances at Storm, then Cyclops.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              The two in Alaska. Just how do you people manage to be in the right 
              place at the right time? Still tinkering with Cerebro?</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              (referring to Logan)<br>
              What do you want with him?</p>
            <p> Magneto smiles now, tapping his METAL HELMET.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Can&uml;&ordf;t read my mind?</p>
            <p> Xavier&uml;&ordf;s expression falters. It appears as if the helmet 
              has been made to block Xavier from doing just that.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;ll tell you something, Charles, we are more alike now 
              than we were when we started.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              Is that so?</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Still trying to make the world safe for our kind. Still trying to 
              find a way to introduce ourselves -- <br>
              definitively.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. 
              What is it like these days?</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Let&uml;&ordf;s just say that I am out to make some radical changes. 
              Now come on Charles. For old times sake, for your sake... Leave 
              him to me.</p>
            <p> Logan slowly rises from the huddled passengers. Sabretooth fighting 
              the urge to move on him. Logan glares back at Sabretooth.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Ahh... there you are brother. I believe you possess something I 
              am very much in need of.</p>
            <p> Just then, SABRETOOTH ROARS UNCONTROLLABLY and punches Toad in 
              the stomach, doubling him over. Oddly - Toad is laughing. He stands 
              upright.</p>
            <p> TOAD<br>
              Do it again.</p>
            <p> Another roar and another punch. Toad is crying and laughing at 
              the same time.</p>
            <p> TOAD (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Oh God it hurts. Do it again.</p>
            <p> Magneto watches this, momentarily stunned.</p>
            <p> Suddenly, Pyro grabs hold of his face.</p>
            <p> PYRO<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;M BLIND.</p>
            <p> And Mystique MORPHS into a small child and begins tugging <br>
              at Magneto&uml;&ordf;s pant leg.</p>
            <p> MYSTIQUE<br>
              I have to go to the bathroom.</p>
            <p> Magneto looks at the cause of it all: XAVIER, HIS EYES <br>
              CONCENTRATING, HAS ALL OF MAGNETO&uml;&ordf;S MINIONS UNDER HIS 
              PSYCHIC CONTROL.</p>
            <p> Cyclops cannot help laughing. Storm and Jean smile.</p>
            <p> Magneto is furious.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              If I could make you understand. If you could just be made to see 
              it the way I do. The way it&uml;&ordf;s going to be.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              The way what is going to be?</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;m going to change the world with or without you as a 
              witness, Charles.<br>
              (Points to Logan)<br>
              And this one gets a front row seat.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              What do you mean to do?</p>
            <p> And Magneto steps back a little further. His oddly behaving consorts 
              follow.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              This checkmate goes to you. I didn&uml;&ordf;t want to hurt anyone. 
              But you leave me <br>
              no choice.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?</p>
            <p> Sabretooth and Toad walk away, still with the punching and asking 
              to be punched.</p>
            <p> Magneto takes the little girl/Mystique by the hand and the blind 
              Pyro by the arm and leads them away, humiliated, to their waiting 
              helicopter.</p>
            <p> Xavier turns back to Logan, still standing in the train car, amidst 
              all the huddled passengers. Suddenly, all the passengers except 
              Rogue lay on the floor and seats and go to sleep. A few of them 
              even snore.</p>
            <p> XAVIER (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Now will you come back with us?</p>
            <p> A look crosses Logan&uml;&ordf;s face. Uncomfortable.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Look, I appreciate your concern. But, I do better on my own.</p>
            <p> Xavier indicates the wreckage of the train.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              You got less than sixty miles today. I&uml;&ordf;ll make you a deal. 
              Two days. If we haven&uml;&ordf;t figured out what Magneto wants 
              with you by then... I&uml;&ordf;ll bring you back myself.</p>
            <p> Logan looks up at Xavier suspiciously, hating that he is making 
              sense. Xavier moves closer.</p>
            <p> Logan looks over at Rogue, covered in her layers of clothes. Storm 
              is helping her off the train, yet taking care not to touch her skin.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              What are you going to do with her?</p>
            <p> Xavier looks to Rogue. A warmth comes over his face. An <br>
              look of understanding. At a glance he has read her mind. He knows 
              her pain -- her struggle. Rogue looks to Xavier. Their eyes meet. 
            </p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              Rogue is a beautiful girl, with an extraordinary power. One that 
              even her own family isn&uml;&ordf;t able to accept. She&uml;&ordf;s 
              been on her own for weeks now, searching for a home. A place to 
              belong.</p>
            <p> Xavier turns to Logan.</p>
            <p> XAVIER (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              -- We&uml;&ordf;re going to give her that.</p>
            <p> Logan looks at rogue, contemplating this. Then to Xavier.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Forty-eight hours, old man. But if you cross me, I won&uml;&ordf;t 
              feel any guilt about what I do to you.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              Deal.</p>
            <p> Logan eyes the rest of the gang until he settles his gaze on Jean. 
              He offers a faint seductive smile. This is not lost on Cyclops.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGNETO&uml;&ordf;S LAIR - CELL - LATER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A cell with bars, but no visible door.</p>
            <p> Kelly is hunched over his toilet, heaving. His suit is rumpled 
              and dirty, showing signs that time has passed.</p>
            <p> There is a television just outside the door:</p>
            <p> We see SEVERAL NEWS HELICOPTERS circling a platform built against 
              the backdrop of the main entrance to Ellis Island. We see massive 
              security measures, the likes of which have never been attempted, 
              being prepared.</p>
            <p> (Voice plays over the rest of the scene)</p>
            <p> NEWSCASTER (V.O.)<br>
              Is there such a thing as too much security? A possible complication 
              adding to the United Nations Anniversary is the sheer number of 
              security personnel for what will be the largest single summit in 
              the history of the planet. </p>
            <p> He walks towards the cell and tries to look down the hall, pressing 
              his face to the bars.</p>
            <p> NEWSCASTER (V.O. CONT&uml;&ordf;D)<br>
              While the Secret Service has never had difficulty handling one or 
              even several world leaders, it has never had to handle the daunting 
              task of watching over all of them.</p>
            <p> It is only then that he hears a slight crack and his head squeezes 
              between the bars like a soft-shelled egg. He gasps in pain, but 
              more from shock. He pulls his head back with some difficulty and 
              POP, it squeezes right back through.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              What have you bastards done to me?</p>
            <p> Kelly is horrified. Disgusted. He paces the cell, unable to comprehend 
              what has happened to himself.</p>
            <p> It is only when he hears the sound of a HELICOPTER IN THE <br>
              DISTANCE that he reacts. He starts to panic, then collects himself. 
              Then he goes over to the bars again. He pauses,afraid... then: </p>
            <p> He pops his head through again. He turns his shoulder toward the 
              bars and begins to push. His feet slip in the floor and his fingers 
              stretch and crack inside, then his ribs begin to pop one by one 
              with the brittleness of undercooked spaghetti. It is agonizing, 
              but Kelly finally manages to pull his horribly-altered body through 
              the bars.</p>
            <p> INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Kelly&uml;&ordf;s whole chest and pelvis are slightly flattened 
              beneath his clothes, but with a hideous crunching sound, they seem 
              to inflate again back to normal.</p>
            <p> Kelly looks at his body with a mixture of fascination and disgust.</p>
            <p> VOICE<br>
              HEY.</p>
            <p> Kelly turns and screams. Blob has just walked into the room and 
              lunges, grabbing him by the arms. Kelly is enveloped in this fat, 
              hulking mass. He manages to keep one hand free and all he can do 
              is push it against Blob&uml;&ordf;s face. It is futile. Until...</p>
            <p> Steam begins to come off Blob&uml;&ordf;s face. And Blob SCREAMS 
              <br>
              IN PAIN.</p>

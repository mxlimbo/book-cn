            <p> Magneto prepares to execute the next stage of his plan when he 
              looks out over the island. A DENSE FOG has rolled in, obscuring 
              his view of the bottom half of the Statue. He looks out towards 
              Ellis Island and sees that the fog is localized over Liberty Island.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              (into radio)<br>
              Be careful everyone... I think we may have company.</p>
            <p> EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The Coast Guard boat Magneto came in on. The giant tarp on the 
              boat and what is under it.</p>
            <p> IT RISES IN THE AIR, standing upright. The tarp slides to the 
              deck to reveal:</p>
            <p> THE MACHINE. The one Kelly and Xavier saw. The air ripples as 
              it rises higher in the air.</p>
            <p> INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Storm and Rogue quietly enter the Statue&uml;&ordf;s museum. It 
              is filled with scale models and full size displays documenting the 
              history of Lady Liberty. One display showcasing the METAL STRIPS 
              which line the Statue for support. They quickly head for an exit 
              on the far side of the room.</p>
            <p> SUDDENLY:</p>
            <p> The lights go out. Darkness.</p>
            <p> A low guttural CROAK echoes in the void.</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              (whispering)<br>
              Rogue... run.</p>
            <p> Rogue runs into the darkness, heading for the exit. She dashes 
              past a six foot copper replica of the Statue and out the door.</p>
            <p> As soon as Rogue is past, the Statue&uml;&ordf;s HEAD TURNS and 
              <br>
              watches her go. The replica blinks and the eyes turn Mystique yellow.</p>
            <p> INT. TORCH - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The machine is rising. Logan yanks at the manacles in an attempt 
              to pull his hands free.</p>
            <p> INT. OLD TORCH ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A giant room that welcomes the many visitors to the Statue. In 
              the center is the old torch, placed there after the Statue&uml;&ordf;s 
              1986 restoration. The only light in the room is a soft red glow 
              that emanates from the old torch.</p>
            <p> Cyclops notices a map of the Statue on a pedestal.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              Over there.</p>
            <p> Cyclops and Jean study the map, looking for the way to the torch. 
              In front of them is the old torch. It&uml;&ordf;s eerie red glow 
              is growing brighter.</p>
            <p> EXT. STATUE - TORCH - NIGHT</p>
            <p> THE MACHINE rises up and into the bottom of the torch itself.</p>
            <p> INT. TORCH - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The machine is now almost on him. Logan&uml;&ordf;s struggles 
              turns to rage. SHOOK -- He pops his claws and frantically cuts at 
              the wall behind him, as the machine draws closer.</p>
            <p> INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> We hear an ominous LOW RUMBLE, as you hear on an overcast day 
              just before a thunderstorm. SHEETS OF HEAT LIGHTNING begin to roll 
              across the ceiling, lighting the room in sporadic bursts.</p>
            <p> Toad darts around the room.</p>
            <p> FLASH -- Reptile eyes -- DARKNESS.</p>
            <p> FLASH -- A WEBBED CLAW -- closer -- DARKNESS.</p>
            <p> FLASH -- leaping body -- closer -- DARKNESS.</p>
            <p> Silence. Darkness.</p>
            <p> The heat lightning continues to expose the room in rolling flashes.</p>
            <p> Silence. Darkness.</p>
            <p> Suddenly, behind Storm the sound of ELEVATOR DOORS <br>
              OPENING. Storm spins and unleashes a BOLT OF LIGHTNING. <br>
              The lightning strikes an empty GLASS HYDRAULIC ELEVATOR SHAFT. No 
              TOAD.</p>
            <p> INT. OLD TORCH ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: The map of the statue. Cyclops watches as the 
              dim red glow turns brighter and brighter. He turns to look up at 
              the old torch -- it glows FIERY RED HOT.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              Get down!</p>
            <p> THE TORCH EXPLODES.</p>
            <p> A RING OF FIRE wipes across the room.</p>
            <p> Cyclops and Jean duck behind the marble map pedestal as fire whips 
              around them.</p>
            <p> Move up through the CEILING OF FIRE to reveal Pyro at the 
              center of the old torch. His eyes wide, manipulating the fire like 
              an orchestra conductor.</p>
            <p> INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE MUSEUM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Rogue runs down the hallway, she stops. The sound of <br>
              footsteps echo from behind her. The footsteps quicken from walking 
              to running. Rogue runs to get away as the footsteps of her pursuer 
              get closer.</p>
            <p> INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Darkness. Silence -- except for the sound of Storm&uml;&ordf;s 
              own <br>
              breathing. Storm&uml;&ordf;s eyes dart around the room, her senses 
              are in overdrive.</p>
            <p> Suddenly, SLIME drips onto her cheek. A low guttural <br>
              CROAK. Storm looks up -- TOAD clings to the ceiling.</p>
            <p> WHAM. Webbed feet slam into Storm&uml;&ordf;s chest sending her 
              <br>
              flying into the elevator shaft. She crashes helplessly to the bottom 
              -- stunned.</p>
            <p> Toad&uml;&ordf;s head peers through the open elevator doors to 
              the level below, looking down on the helpless Storm. Toad SMILES. 
              His webbed finger presses the elevator button.</p>
            <p> The elevator doors above her close, sealing her in the glass tubular 
              shaft. The ROAR of the hydraulic engine coming to life, the elevator 
              begins its crushing descent down toward Storm as 
              she lies at the bottom of the shaft dazed.</p>
            <p> INT. OLD TORCH ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> C.U. on Jean and Cyclops both pinned down.</p>
            <p> Fire sweeps around the map pedestal. Cyclops turns.</p>
            <p> BOOM -- He fires a series of OPTIC BLASTS blindly through <br>
              the fire, blasting the ceiling.</p>
            <p> Chunks of debris from the ceiling shower down onto Pyro. The inferno 
              stops.</p>
            <p> Smoke fills the room, Jean tries to catch her breath. Cyclops 
              stands and heads toward the old torch trying to draw a bead on Pyro. 
              Cyclops doesn&uml;&ordf;t see him. When:</p>
            <p> A COLUMN OF FIRE erupts from the thick smoke, rocketing <br>
              at Cyclops.</p>
            <p> Cyclops dodges, flipping a heavy wood table with flaming <br>
              pamphlets on it -- using it as a shield against Pyro&uml;&ordf;s 
              fiery onslaught.</p>
            <p> EXT. TORCH - BACK - NIGHT</p>
            <p> ANGLE FROM DIRECTLY OVERHEAD:</p>
            <p> Magneto on the side of the torch&uml;&ordf;s flame raises the 
              huge <br>
              machine -- while on the other side -- LOGAN PUSHES <br>
              HIMSELF THROUGH THE HOLE -- his hands still bound behind his back, 
              and slams against the outer railing of the torch.</p>
            <p> Logan looks around in shock. He realizes where he is. He looks 
              out at all the activity on Ellis Island, drawing a greater understanding 
              of Magneto&uml;&ordf;s plan.</p>
            <p> EXT. TORCH - FRONT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> With a MAGNETIC RIPPLE of the air Magneto drives the <br>
              machine right up through the bottom of the torch like batteries 
              in a flashlight.</p>
            <p> EXT. TORCH - BACK - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Logan turns his back to the hole he has just emerged from and 
              braces his cuffs against the rising machine. The machine pushes 
              against Logan&uml;&ordf;s wrists driving his cuffs up against the 
              top of the hole. </p>
            <p> CRACK.</p>
            <p> The pressure leaves the cuffs apart.</p>
            <p> INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Storm&uml;&ordf;s eyes open, looking straight up.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: The elevator continuing its crushing descent.</p>
            <p> Storm struggles to her feet. Her hand presses against the thick 
              glass elevator shaft, it surrounds her like a coffin.</p>
            <p> LIGHTNING strike the glass -- to no effect.</p>
            <p> Storm frantically searches for a way out. She looks up to see 
              the elevator closing fast.</p>
            <p> Storm raises her hands above her head. WIND begins to lift Storm&uml;&ordf;s 
              hair. The wind picks up and starts swirling violently against the 
              sides of the elevator shaft.</p>
            <p> Wildly, the wind whips around causing a CYCLONE within <br>
              the glass shaft buffeting upwards against the elevator.</p>
            <p> The elevator groans as the hydraulics fight the unrelenting vortex 
              of wind. Smoke begins to pour from the hydraulics, which whine in 
              protest. At the center of the tornado stands Storm, a force of nature.</p>
            <p> As the elevator continues its descent the cyclone pushes <br>
              outward. Small cracks start to appear on the glass walls.</p>
            <p> She is now forced almost to the ground. The elevator is now inches 
              from Storm&uml;&ordf;s head. The floor is made of a thicker version 
              of the same Plexiglas and we look up through it, the massive elevator 
              looming over Storm.</p>
            <p> BOOM.</p>
            <p> The glass walls explode outward, showering the museum.</p>
            <p> Storm partly rolls and is partly blown from the shaft to safety. 
              The pressure of the cyclone released, the elevator SLAMS to the 
              bottom.</p>
            <p> INT. OLD TORCH ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Jean, having caught her breath, looks over to:</p>
            <p> C.U. on Cyclops. He&uml;&ordf;s pinned down as fire wraps around 
              the table -- the fire is burning through.</p>
            <p> Jean, seeing Cyclops defenseless, stands up from behind the marble 
              podium. She quickly scans the room and spots, on opposite walls 
              near the old torch, TWO LARGE FIRE <br>
              EXTINGUISHERS.</p>
            <p> Jean stretches out her fists and focuses her telekinesis.</p>
            <p> Pyro spots Jean -- with one hand continuing to blast Cyclops, 
              he uses the other to unleash an ARM OF FIRE toward Jean.</p>
            <p> Jean focuses as she brings her outstretched fists closer together. 
              Suddenly -- the two fire extinguishers crash through their glass 
              holders.</p>
            <p> Like two gunslingers in a showdown.</p>
            <p> The extinguishers bullet toward Pyro.</p>
            <p> The arm of fire rockets closer to Jean.</p>
            <p> Suddenly, the EXTINGUISHERS COLLIDE EXPLODING in front of Pyro.</p>
            <p> Inches from Jean&uml;&ordf;s face, the ARM OF FIRE disappears.</p>
            <p> The COLUMN OF FLAMES against Scott VANISHES. The flames once covering 
              the room are gone, a choking smoke is all <br>
              that remains.</p>
            <p> Through the smoke, at the center of the old torch, Pyro lies dead, 
              covered in a sea of white foam.</p>
            <p> Jean starts choking on the smoke. Cyclops stands and motions for 
              her to get out of the smoke filled room.</p>
            <p> EXT. TORCH - FRONT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The machine finally locks into place. Magneto raises a walkie 
              talkie to his face.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Lights on.</p>
            <p> INT. POWER STATION - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Sabretooth grabs a hold of the lever for the &uml;&not;Liberty 
              Display? power breaker and pulls up. Turning it on.</p>
            <p> INT. ELLIS ISLAND - GREAT HALL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The lights of the Statue come back on. The crowd of dignitaries 
              burst into enthusiastic applause as if it is part of the proceedings.</p>
            <p> INT. SECURITY CONTROL CENTER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The Statue now lit up in the monitors.</p>
            <p> OPERATION COMMANDER<br>
              Roger. We see the lights.</p>
            <p> EXT. TORCH - FRONT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Magneto turns and opens the hatch. Magneto sees the hole <br>
              -- Logan is gone.</p>
            <p> EXT. TORCH - BACK - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Magneto walks over and stares at the hole, clearly out by <br>
              Logan&uml;&ordf;s claws.</p>
            <p> Magneto looks at his fingers after wiping the edge of the hole. 
              Logan&uml;&ordf;s blood. Magneto looks down and sees Logan&uml;&ordf;s 
              claw marks down the arm of the Statue, marking his escape.</p>
            <p> Magneto scans the island from his high perch. He does not see 
              Logan.</p>
            <p> EXT. STATUE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The doors to the old torch room burst open -- SMOKE <br>
              BILLOWS OUT. Jean runs out coughing violently.</p>
            <p> Suddenly, Toad lands in front of Jean, grabs her head and <br>
              before she can react, his tongue launches at her face.</p>
            <p> His tongue covers her face with an ADHESIVE SLIME. Jean <br>
              falls to the ground. Toad looks back at the main entrance, sees 
              Cyclops emerging and LEAPS up, out of frame.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Cyclops stumbles out of the smoke filled building. Seeing Jean 
              lying on the ground, he runs to her.</p>
            <p> Cyclops turns Jean on her back, ready to perform CPR. He <br>
              is shocked, the slime has now hardened to Jean&uml;&ordf;s face. 
              She is suffocating. He desperately tries to pry it off.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> The camera quickly pulls higher and higher revealing --</p>
            <p> TOAD&uml;&ordf;S P.O.V.</p>
            <p> EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Toad looks down, perched on top of the railing surrounding the 
              base of the Statue -- the same position he had before crushing the 
              Secret Service agent.</p>
            <p> Toad arches his back ready to spring downward. He will kill two 
              birds with one crushing leap.</p>
            <p> The sound of WIND.</p>
            <p> C.U. Toad&uml;&ordf;s face static, his eyes slowly look to the 
              side. His head twists, looking over his shoulder. Storm stands behind 
              him.</p>
            <p> Toad turns and hops off the railing towards Storm.</p>
            <p> C.U. on TOAD&uml;&ordf;S FACE. Which is horrible.</p>
            <p> TOAD<br>
              Don&uml;&ordf;t you people die?</p>
            <p> Suddenly the wind picks up violently. Toad moves closer <br>
              -- fighting the wind.</p>
            <p> Storm is MAD. A face we remember seeing on a young girl <br>
              in Africa.</p>
            <p> Toad fights the gale force winds, his webbed feet adhering to 
              the ground. He inches closer to Storm. Toad bares his FANGS.</p>
            <p> EXT. STATUE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> On the ground Cyclops notices the wind howling with rage <br>
              above him. He frantically pulls on the encrusted slime <br>
              suffocating Jean.</p>
            <p> EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Storm&uml;&ordf;s eyes widen. HURRICANE force winds blast Toad. 
              <br>
              Try as he might to use his sticky feet to hold on, Toad is blown 
              back off his feet, catching the deck with his hands.</p>
            <p> The piece of the deck TEARS LOOSE still attached to Toad&uml;&ordf;s 
              hands. He flies off the deck, past the metal railing. Toad&uml;&ordf;s 
              tongue LASHES OUT AND ATTACHES TO THE RAILING. For a moment, Toad 
              just flaps there like a flag. </p>
            <p> Storm RAISES HER ARMS.</p>
            <p> CRASH -- A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes the railing.</p>
            <p> Toad is blown off the railing in a flash of electricity and --</p>
            <p> EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Toad lands in the water. He disappears below the surface <br>

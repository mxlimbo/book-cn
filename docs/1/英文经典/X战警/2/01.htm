            <p> Sounds of a train rolling to a halt, a shrill whistle.</p>
            <p> EXT. CAMP - DAY</p>
            <p> UP ON the door of a weathered cattle car as a German soldier steps 
              into frame wearing that familiar gray of the all-too familiar era.</p>
            <p> He throws the door to reveal a mass of huddled and frightened 
              people inside.</p>
            <p> The words are not necessary. The language is not ours and the 
              images say enough.</p>
            <p> Men, women and children are herded off the train like cattle toward 
              a large open yard. There they huddle until the Germans begin to 
              shout and shove through the mob.</p>
            <p> EXT. FENCE CORRIDOR - DAY</p>
            <p> We are looking up at rows and rows of fences topped with <br>
              barbed wire all designed to create a separator for the thousands 
              of Jew who pour through each day.</p>
            <p> Then we see the eyes themselves that look up at them.A LITTLE 
              BOY. A boy who will not die this day. A boy who will live to see 
              the end of the war and the world of the future.</p>
            <p> He stares at the metal wire with an unusual fascination.</p>
            <p> The boy looks up at HIS WORRIED PARENTS - a sturdy-<br>
              looking couple who try to smile and comfort him.</p>
            <p> The corridor comes to a junction where it splits in several different 
              directions.</p>
            <p> Soldiers here push the mob using rifles as pikes, screaming and 
              terrorizing the lot of them. Suddenly it is clear what they are 
              doing. They are dividing the mob into smaller groups.</p>
            <p> Soon, the groups themselves become evident.</p>
            <p> Men from women. Children from adults.</p>
            <p> The family tries to stay together, clinging to one another dearly, 
              until finally, they are put upon by a number of gray uniforms and 
              pulled apart. The boy is dragged screaming his feet no longer touching 
              the ground. Two soldiers carry him as they follow the back of a 
              large column of children being led through a gate of barbed wire 
              so dense, it resembles wool.</p>
            <p> The gate closes and the boy looks back to see his parents along 
              with many others - being restrained by a number of soldiers. The 
              screaming is deafening.</p>
            <p> And the boy's can be heard above it all. The soldiers seem to 
              be having a hard time carrying such a frail child. The farther they 
              get from the fence, the heavier he seems to get, until they are 
              literally pulling him as though he were anchored to something.</p>
            <p> His outstretched fingers claw at the thin air and he screams until 
              the blood in his face is blue.</p>
            <p> The soldiers are literally pulled back a step and they begin to 
              slip in the mud. They look at one another and then over their shoulders 
              as they hear a sound.</p>
            <p> A groaning, creaking sound. And then the unmistakable twang of 
              wire stretched to snapping.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> The fence. The gate that separates the parents. It bows toward 
              them like iron filings to a magnet, and several of the strands of 
              barbed wire have given way.</p>
            <p> The boy continues to scream as all the other faces simply freeze 
              and wonder.</p>
            <p> One of the soldiers pulls a wooden baton from his belt and brains 
              the boy violently.</p>
            <p> He slumps and the soldiers carrying him spring forward as through 
              a rope that was holding them back has been cut. They nearly fall, 
              looking at one another with some concern, some confusion....</p>
            <p> Then they follow the line of children that has gotten ahead of 
              them.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> The boy's parents watch him as he -- as they, are taken away.</p>
            <p> The rest of their story is as you would expect.</p>
            <p>EXT. SKY - DAY</p>
            <p> Bright, bright blue framing a blinding white sun.</p>
            <p> PAN DOWN AGAIN TO REVEAL:</p>
            <p> The cracked, drought-stricken soil of nowhere.</p>
            <p> TITLES:</p>
            <p> KENYA - 1978</p>
            <p> A group of children at play. Tribal children who, without the 
              help of the titles, could be from any age.</p>
            <p> They run through a tiny village of tents, playing. Every child 
              holds a long reed-like stick and they chase each other playing their 
              version of tag.</p>
            <p> As each child is tapped, they chase the others. Each trying to 
              avoid being &quot;it&quot;, though never going far enough away to 
              miss the fun.</p>
            <p> One girl in particular. A PRETTY GIRL OF 12, with unusual white 
              hair, is tagged and immediately shunned.</p>
            <p> She chases kids this way and that, but to no avail. She is not 
              strong enough, nor agile enough, to win.</p>
            <p> She tumbles and lands on her stick, snapping it. She stands and, 
              when the children see that her stick is broken, they begin to giggle.</p>
            <p> The giggles become laughter and the laughter becomes a taunt, 
              and before we even realize, the inherent cruelty of children let 
              loose becomes evident.</p>
            <p> They have now formed a circle, at first avoiding her touch with 
              distance, but now growing tighter with menace. In the unspoken manner 
              of children at prey, the group begins to chant in their native tongue 
              - a song we have not heard but sung in a way none-too inviting. 
              They begin to poke at her with the reeds, driving her back.</p>
            <p> The girl now moves to the center of the circle, no longer wishing 
              to tag anyone.</p>
            <p> ONE DEVIOUS CHILD seems to get an idea. He takes his stick and 
              smacks it across her shoulder. She turns to face the child and another 
              swings his stick across her back with a solid THWACK. Before long, 
              mob rule gives way and all the kids are swinging at her and laughing.</p>
            <p> It grows to the brink of frenzy, the laughing and the shouting 
              not too unlike the noise of the previous scene.</p>
            <p> So much so, we may miss the first flake of snow. The children 
              certainly do. It is snowing for a good ten seconds before the last 
              of them stops.</p>
            <p> By then, the snow is thick as flies and wafting down to melt instantly 
              on the hot African soil that has never seen snow before.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Adults come out of their huts and in from the fields and the whole 
              of the village is soon gathered around the little girl, staring 
              up from the clear blue sky and the snow that falls from nowhere. 
              From nothing.</p>
            <p> One by one, all eyes fall on the little girl and the looks of 
              curiosity become looks of fear. Of superstition.</p>
            <p> Punctuated by a solid thump.</p>
            <p> And then another.</p>
            <p> AN OLD MAN looks down at his feet and sees a tiny, misshapen ball 
              of ice, no bigger than his eye. He looks at it, bites it, then pops 
              it in his mouth - breath turning to steam.</p>
            <p> Another such chunk of ice pops him on the head. THE <br>
              CROWD LAUGHS.</p>
            <p> They look up again and see that mixed with the snow are tiny pellets 
              of hail, seeming to increase in number as the snow mysteriously 
              wanes.</p>
            <p> And the pellets are getting larger. Until they land as hunks.</p>
            <p> The white haired girl drops to the ground and covers her head 
              as hailstones the size of baseballs plow into the Earth.</p>
            <p> Before long, tents are collapsing and panic ensues.</p>
            <p> And all along the white haired girl sits huddled in the dust, 
              crying.</p>
            <p> As hailstones fall in a circle around her, never coming closer 
              than then a few feet or so.</p>
            <p> INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> ONE MORE SKY. This one a backdrop. Cheap paint and <br>
              tissue paper hung with hooks on a wall just behind the basket on 
              a full court.</p>
            <p> As we pull back, we see the skyline of New York, crudely made 
              out with its silhouette buildings of dark gray and black - windows 
              of yellow.</p>
            <p> Among the famous landmarks represented is the Statue of Liberty, 
              complete with a real light bulb burning in the torch.</p>
            <p> We are at a prom. The theme is RHAPSODY IN BLUE and the <br>
              decor has made tragic efforts to show it. The tablecloths are blue, 
              the napkins are blue - far too many of the tuxes are powder blue, 
              and the blue eye shadow is as heavy as expected.</p>
            <p> Peter Gabriel's &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; gives painful indication 
              of the era, but here it is, nonetheless:</p>
            <p> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA - 1986</p>
            <p> MOVE ACROSS THE FLOOR and through the swaying, clutching, sweating 
              dancers to the bathroom.</p>
            <p> Through the door to the usual - </p>
            <p> INT. BOYS BATHROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Several boys are here, bow ties undone - unclipped in most cases. 
              Smoking, drinking from whatever inventive container was used to 
              smuggle in booze. Breath freshener and Visine are the chaser.</p>
            <p> Some of the guys are rolling joints while others make the sad 
              effort to wave smoke away. Who are they kidding? It's a fog in here.</p>
            <p> MOVE DOWN THE ROW OF TOILET STALLS to one in particular. Here 
              we find A FRECKLED KID standing in front of mirror, clearly holding 
              himself up from the effect of God knows <br>
              what.</p>
            <p> He talks to his friend in the he stall behind him.</p>
            <p> FRECKLED KID<br>
              Man, what's the matter with you?</p>
            <p> His friend is on the toilet with his head in his hands. He seems 
              to be in some pain. He is SCOTT SUMMERS - AGE 17.</p>
            <p> FRECKLED KID (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Dude. Lighten up. She's just a girl. You just gotta- </p>
            <p> SCOTT<br>
              No, my eyes... my eyes are killing me. </p>
            <p> The Freckled kid offers a small plastic bottle.</p>
            <p> FRECKLED KID<br>
              You want some Visine, man?</p>
            <p> SCOTT<br>
              My... eyes...</p>
            <p> The freckled kid looks and sees that Scott's eyes are watering 
              so badly that tears are literally streaming through his fingers.</p>
            <p> He goes back to the mirror to look at his own.</p>
            <p> SCOTT<br>
              ... they're burning...</p>
            <p> The freckled kid turns back to him.</p>
            <p> FRECKLED KID<br>
              Dude, how much did you smoke?</p>
            <p> SCOTT<br>
              I didn't smoke anything.</p>
            <p> Scott looks up, taking his hands away, revealing for an instant 
              that his eyes are merely bright red embers in his head. Featureless 
              but for the color.</p>
            <p> Freckles takes a step back.</p>
            <p> INT. GYM - OUTSIDE BOYS ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A blinding flash of light shows through the frosted glass in the 
              double door and cuts through the crack into the dark of the gym.</p>
            <p> All who see it are stunned. Frozen. A lingering moment of confusion, 
              then:</p>
            <p> BOOM, the doors to the Boys Room burst open and the occupants 
              scatter into the gym.</p>
            <p> INT. GYM - STALL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Freckles is still there, legs locked.</p>
            <p> FRECKLES' P.O.V.</p>
            <p> He looks at Scott who is now crying meekly in the stall, covering 
              his eyes again -- afraid to open them.</p>
            <p> The door of the stall across from him swings closed TO <br>
              REVEAL:</p>
              <p> A HOLE, PUNCHED THROUGH THE STALL DOOR framing Scott's face perfectly. 
                Pull back to reveal that the hole continues through the wall, 
                into the girl's bathroom next door.</p>
            <p> In the corner several girls huddle together, they are afraid.</p>
            <p> INT. SENATE HEARING ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Packed with reporters and photographers. There's a dais - <br>
              a raised panel of senators - and a second, lower panel. This is 
              where the &quot;experts&quot; are testifying.</p>
            <p> Panning across the faces of several G.O.P. creeps as they watch 
              something with varying degrees of interest.</p>
            <p> TITLES:</p>
            <p> WASHINGTON D.C. - THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE</p>
            <p> A woman's voice holds over the proceedings. It is the voice of 
              JEAN GREY - whom we will soon meet.</p>
            <p> As she is speaking, we come to a large screen television at one 
              end of the room.</p>
            <p> JEAN (O.S.)<br>
              In every organism on Earth there exists a mutator gene - the X-factor, 
              as it has come to be known. It is the basic building block of evolution 
              - the reason we have evolved from homo habilus...</p>
            <p> FOOTAGE REFLECTS THE VARIOUS STAGES OF HUMAN EVOLUTION. <br>
              Accompanying it is a GRAPH with a DIAGONAL LINE <br>
              indicating the ascent of the &quot;human being&quot; as we know 
              it. <br>
              Accompanying the graph are evolving images of the &quot;evolution 
              of man.&quot;</p>
            <p> JEAN (O.S.) (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              ... to homo erectus, to homo sapiens Neanderthals, and, finally, 
              to homo sapiens.</p>
            <p> The animated demo on the screen zooms in on the lowest order of 
              human depicted - homo habilus - a primitive, ape-like humanoid covered 
              in hair. As he is singled out, the terrain of his time appears, 
              along with the harsh signs of his winter.</p>
            <p> JEAN (O.S.) (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Taking it's cues from the climate, terrain, various sources of <br>
                nourishment, the mutator gene tells the body when it needs to 
                change to adapt to a new environment. The process is subtle, normally 
                taking thousands of years.</p>
            <p> As the graphic changes and depicts WARMER CLIMATE, the <br>
                HAIR STARTS TO DISAPPEAR ON THE MAN'S BODY - gradually evolving 
                into the human we now know as ourselves.</p>
              <p> Now the terrain is modern, the weather pleasant. The image pulls 
                back and places this man back in line at the front of evolution.</p>
            <p> JEAN (O.S.) (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
                Only in the last few thousand years did mankind begin to make 
                clothes for himself, build shelters, use heat and grow food in 
                large quantities. With this man-made environment remaining <br>
                relatively stable, the X-factor became dormant.</p>
              <p> QUICK SHOTS: early huts, early clothing; then early homes, later 
                homes, air conditioning, cars, modern high- rises, etc.</p>

              <p> A strong, attractive woman in her early 30's. A simple placard

                For reasons still not known to us, we are seeing what some are 
                calling the beginnings of another stage of evolution - </p>
            <p> A MICROPHONED VOICE interrupts. Bearing down is the <br>
                flamboyant SENATOR SCOTT &quot;FRANK&quot; KELLY, a conservative 
                from Florida, and the hearing's Chairman.</p>

              typical government cog.</p>

                You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of 
                the hearing, Ms. Grey. Three words: Are mutants dangerous?</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
                I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator. The 
                wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.</p>
            <p> Another SENATOR (LUCINDA ROWEE) speaks into her <br>
              microphone:</p>
            <p> SENATOR ROWEE<br>
              Well, we do license people to drive.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              But not to live.</p>
            <p> Kelly raises a hand, continuing his tirade.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New 
              York. Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you 
              are teaching these mutants?</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Math. History. Science. English. Athletics --</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers 
              to --</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Control, Senator... we teach them control.</p>
            <p> Kelly raises a blown-up photograph: a grainy, superoomed, somewhat 
              obscured image of a CAR ON A FREEWAY which appears to have &quot;melted.&quot; 
              Now he's really playing to the crowd.</p>
            <p> KELLY <br>
              This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey. 
              A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of 
              him. don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come 
              from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off. 
              You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger. (laughs 
              from the crowd) But what you presume to tell this committee - </p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator 
              gene will activate in every living human being on this planet. Perhaps 
              even your children, Senator.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.</p>
            <p> The room LAUGHS. Kelly mistaken thinks it is for him, until the 
              double meaning occurs to him. He is momentarily embarrassed, but 
              he quickly recovers.</p>
            <p> KELLY (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Ms. Grey, we are not here to weed out mutants. The egistration Act 
              is designed merely to assess their potential threat - if any - to 
              national security.</p>
            <p> The crowd reacts loudly in support of the Senator. Some cheer, 
              some roar, some yell obscenities at Jean.</p>
            <p> Jean stands and walks out, pushing her way through reporters now 
              moving in for her response. All the while, Kelly is delivering his 
              last words.</p>
            <p> KELLY (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Mutants are very real. They are among us. We must know who they 
              are. And above all, we must know what they can do.</p>

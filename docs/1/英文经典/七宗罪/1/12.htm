              78 INT. TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL/HALLWAY -- DAY 78</p>
            <p> Mills moves from the stairwell, driven, his nose still bleeding,<br>
              heading for apartment 6A. Somerset takes Mills arm, but Mills<br>
              pulls away and keeps going.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Wait... just wait.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              It was him.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              You can't go in there.</p>
            <p> Somerset grabs Mills again and Mills shoves him off.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              The hell I can't! We get in there and we can stop him.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              We need a warrant.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              We have probable cause now.</p>
            <p> Somerset grabs Mills and shoves him against the wall.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Think about it...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What the fuck is wrong with you?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Think about how we got here!</p>
            <p> Somerset holds the computer paper, now crumpled in his hand. He<br>
              waves it in Mills' face as Mills struggles.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              We can't tell anyone about this. We can't tell them about the Bureau, 
              so we have no reason for being here.</p>
            <p> Mills stops struggling, breathing hard, seething, trembling.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Think it through. If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute. 
              He'll walk.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on THIS door.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Okay... okay... get off.</p>
            <p> Somerset releases Mills. Mills looks around the hall, then goes<br>
              right to door 6A and KICKS IT IN -- the door jam splinters and<br>
              the door swings open to darkness for a moment before swinging<br>
              back, half-shut.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              You stupid son of a...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              No point in arguing anymore...</p>
            <p> Mills strides down the short end of the hall, towards a window.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (pointing back)<br>
              Unless you can fix that.</p>
            <p> Mills stops, looking out the window. It overlooks a weedy,<br>
              overgrown courtyard where a THIN VAGRANT lies asleep on the<br>
              concrete. Mills turns, looking back to Somerset.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              How much money do we have left?</p>
            <p>79 INT. TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- EARLY EVENING 79</p>
            <p> On a stairwell landing, Somerset watches the thin vagrant from<br>
              the courtyard talk to a uniformed POLICEMAN who writes on a<br>
              clipboard, taking the statement.</p>
            <p> THIN VAGRANT<br>
              So, I... I noticed this guy going out...<br>
              going out a lot when those murders were happening. So... so I...</p>
            <p> The vagrant's clinging to the rail, drunk and out of it. Mills<br>
              is down further on the stairs, high strung, chomping at the bit<br>
              to get this over with.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              So, you called Detective Somerset, right?</p>
            <p> THIN VAGRANT<br>
              Yeah, I... I called the detective.<br>
              Because, because this guy seemed... creepy.<br>
              And... and...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (urging him on)<br>
              And...</p>
            <p> THIN VAGRANT<br>
              And, one of the murders was over there...<br>
              over... nearby here. I... I called the<br>
              cops...</p>
            <p> The vagrant wipes drool from his lips. Mills comes to grip him<br>
              so he doesn't fall, searching the policemen's face for suspicion.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I told you the rest. You got it?</p>
            <p> POLICEMAN<br>
              (still writing)<br>
              Yeah, whatever.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Have him sign it.</p>
            <p> The policeman holds the clipboard and pen out to the vagrant.<br>
              Mills takes the pen and guides the vagrant's hand, almost signing<br>
              it for him.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Great. Is that it?</p>
            <p> The policeman nods. Mills grips the vagrant and leads him down<br>
              the stairs in a hurry, around a bend. Mills looks up to be sure<br>
              they're out of the policeman's sight, takes out a wad of cash and<br>
              shoves it in the vagrant's pocket.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Go drink yourself happy.</p>
            <p> Mills quickly guides the vagrant on his way, then turns and<br>
              rushes up the stairs, taking them two at a time.</p>
            <p>80 INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- EARLY EVENING 80</p>
            <p> Mills pushes door 6A open, putting on rubber gloves. He steps 
              in<br>
              with Somerset behind. Somerset turns back to the policeman.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (to policeman)<br>
              Wait outside.</p>
            <p> Somerset closes the door most of the way. Mills hits a switch 
              on<br>
              the wall and a lamp illuminates a desk. The desk is in the<br>
              center of the room, facing them. The room is bizarre, with some<br>
              areas cluttered and others barren. All the walls are painted<br>
              black. All the large, curtainless windows are painted over.</p>
            <p> Somerset puts on his gloves. Mills walks to the desk.</p>
            <p> The desktop is rather tidy. The only blatantly strange thing is<br>
              a set of notches carved into the wooden surface: three notches.<br>
              A candle has been allowed to burn down at one corner of the desk<br>
              and the wax trail goes all the way to the floor. Mills opens the<br>
              middle desk drawer. It's empty except for The Holy Bible.</p>
            <p> Somerset moves along shelves of books, looking at the spines.<br>
              Lots of thick, oversized art volumes. A HISTORY OF THEOLOGY.<br>
              HANDBOOK OF FIREARMS. HISTORY OF THE WORLD. SUMMA THEOLOGICA.<br>
              UNITED STATES CRIMINAL LAW REVIEW.</p>
            <p> At the desk, Mills opens another drawer. It's filled with at<br>
              least forty empty aspirin bottles. He opens the next drawer and<br>
              finds a rosary and several boxes of bullets.</p>
            <p> Somerset comes to look at John Doe's &quot;bed.&quot; No mattress. 
              It's<br>
              only a metal frame and springs with a sheet spread across it.<br>
              The sheet is sweat stained and dotted by stains of rust at many<br>
              points where springs have worn through.</p>
            <p> Somerset walks around the bed to a narrow table not far away<br>
              against the wall. The table contains a strange tableau, like a<br>
              mini stage, hand-made of cardboard and pasted Communion wafers.<br>
              A human hand immersed in a jar of liquid is the centerpiece.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (quiet, to himself)<br>
              Victor.</p>
            <p> Above this, on the wall, there's a clutter of pinned up articles<br>
              about the seven deadly sins, pages from art books, pencil<br>
              drawings of Christ, all tight together and overlapping.</p>
            <p> Mills picks up a small piece of paper from a letter holder. It's<br>
              a pink receipt from WILD BILL'S LEATHER SHOP.</p>
            <p> Written: CUSTOM JOB. $502.64. PAID IN FULL. Mills puts the<br>
              receipt back down on the desk.</p>
            <p> Somerset walks to a black door. Opens it.</p>
            <p>81 INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMEN, ROOM TWO -- EARLY EVENING 81</p>
            <p> Somerset enters. A ceiling light is on. Bare bulb. There are<br>
              bookshelves on three walls, filled with notebooks. Thousands and<br>
              thousands of notebooks.</p>
            <p> Somerset takes one notebook down. It is a thick composition book<br>
              with an unlabeled cover. Inside, the pages are filled with small<br>
              handwritten sentences, thumb-nail sketches and blurry, glued in<br>
              photographs; small photos, seemingly cut from contact sheets.<br>
              the sketches, pictures and writings takes up ever single inch.</p>
            <p> Somerset takes down another notebook and flips through the pages.<br>
              Same as the first, filled to the brim.</p>
            <p> Somerset crosses to another shelf and pulls another notebook.<br>
              Same deal. Somerset looks around.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Jesus.</p>
            <p>82 INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- EARLY EVENING 82</p>
            <p> Mills moves from the desk to a hall. He tries a light switch,<br>
              but it does nothing. He walks...</p>
            <p> It's dark. A rather long hall. The only light is a red glow<br>
              seeping from under the bottom of the closed door ahead.</p>
            <p>83 INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO -- EARLY EVENING 83</p>
            <p> Somerset walks to a 16mm film projector. It sits facing a<br>
              battered white screen. Somerset turns the projector on, backing<br>
              away to switch off the bare bulb above.</p>
            <p>84 INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, HALL -- EARLY EVENING 84</p>
            <p> Mills reaches the door at the end of the hall. He turns the knob<br>
              and pushes the door open. He's bathed in red light.</p>
            <p>85 INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- EARLY EVENING 85</p>
            <p> Mills enters. He looks around, slowly. Stunned.</p>
            <p>86 INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO -- EARLY EVENING 86</p>
            <p> The projector is clattering in the dark, running a piece of film<br>
              through. The film is spliced to run as a non-stop loop.<br>
              Somerset watches the screen, light strobing across him.</p>
            <p> The screen shows a bright image of clouds drifting, with strange<br>
              superimposed angels in flowing robes floating jerkily. It's like<br>
              a weird, old Hollywood version of Heaven.</p>
            <p> The images switch abruptly to fire and tormented souls laboring<br>
              around a pit of molten goo, where more tormented humans squirm.<br>
              Like Heaven, it's a scratched piece of film from Hollywood's<br>
              early days.</p>
            <p> MILLS (o.s.)<br>
              Somerset!</p>
            <p> Somerset is engrossed in the images.</p>
            <p> MILLS (o.s.)<br>
              Somerset... come here!</p>
            <p> Somerset hears him.</p>
            <p>87 INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, HALL/BATHROOM -- EARLY EVENING 87</p>
            <p> Somerset comes down the hall.</p>
            <p> MILLS (o.s.)<br>
              We had him, damn it.</p>
            <p> Somerset reaches the bathroom where Mills stands looking up at<br>
              the wall. The room has been converted into a dark room lit by<br>
              red bulbs, with strips of film hanging from the ceiling.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              What are you talking about?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              We had him.</p>
            <p> There are hundreds of prints on the walls and hanging from drying<br>
              wires. Somerset looks around, trying to understand...</p>
            <p> Pictures of John Doe's victims, alive and dead. Grotesque<br>
              photos, of their pleading faces, and their dead bodies. Close<br>
              shots of eyes, fingers and mouths.</p>
            <p> Mills sits on the closed toilet, throwing something into the<br>
              nearby sink and resting his head in his hands.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              The pass was a fake.</p>
            <p> In the sink -- it's a laminated press pass on a neck cord.</p>
            <p> On the walls, more pictures: of the crime scenes, but from the<br>
              outside looking in. Long shots. Police cars. Ambulances.<br>
              Uniformed officers putting up police barrier ribbons outside<br>
              buildings. The coroner's wagon.</p>
            <p> Somerset stares at them, taking them in, realizing...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              We had him and we let him go.</p>
            <p> In the backgrounds of the pictures: Somerset and Mills. In<br>
              another: Mills crossing the street. In another: Somerset and<br>
              Mills getting out of Somerset's car.</p>
            <p> One photo, close shot, shows MILLS AND SOMERSET ON THE STAIRWELL<br>
              OF THE BUILDING WHERE VICTOR'S BODY WAS FOUND. It is the<br>
              picture taken by the balding, almost silly looking reporter.</p>
            <p>88 INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT 88</p>
            <p> A male forensic uses tongs to remove Victor's hand from the jar<br>
              of liquid. He places the hand in a clear plastic evidence bag.</p>
            <p> The forensic walks away with the hand, past a FEMALE SKETCH<br>
              ARTIST who puts the finishing touches on an accurate drawing of<br>
              the balding, almost silly looking reporter who wears thick<br>
              glasses, now known as John Doe.</p>
            <p> SKETCH ARTIST<br>
              You're sure this is him?</p>
            <p> Mills stands over the sketch artist. Two deputy detectives, SARA<br>
              and BILLY, are at work along with two other forensics searching,<br>
              photographing and dusting.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Just put it in circulation.</p>
            <p> SKETCH ARTIST<br>
              You got it. Tomorrow morning, this city's good citizens will be 
              on the lookout for Elmer Fudd.</p>
            <p> SARA<br>
              (coming to Mills)<br>
              We can't find anything to hang on to. No paystubs, no appointment 
              books or calenders. Not even an address book. And, you're not going 
              to believe this...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Keep looking.</p>
            <p> SARA<br>
              It's just... we haven't found any fingerprints yet. Not a single 
              one.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You know, you're right, I don't believe you. Keep looking.</p>
            <p> Mills walks away.</p>

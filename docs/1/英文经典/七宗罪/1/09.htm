              60 INT. SLUM APARTMENT, ADJOINING ROOM -- MORNING 60</p>
            <p> The blond cop enters, gun trained, looks around in confusion.</p>
            <p> The room's tables, chairs and floor are covered with hundreds 
              of<br>
              colorful, plastic air fresheners.</p>
            <p>61 INT. SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING 61</p>
            <p> Mills and Somerset enter. Somerset looks at the cops around the<br>
              bed, then looks at a nearby wall. His mouth drops in horror. On<br>
              the wall, written in excrement: SLOTH.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Jesus...</p>
            <p> California kicks the bed, enraged.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              I said get up, Sleepyhead!</p>
            <p> He pulls the sheets off the bed and reveals the shriveled,<br>
              sore-covered form of a man who is blindfolded and tied to the bed<br>
              with a thin wire which has been wrapped time and time again<br>
              around the mattress and bed frame. Tubes runs out from a stained<br>
              loincloth around the man's waist and snake under the bed.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              Fuck me!</p>
            <p> Mills pushes past the other cops.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Holy shit.</p>
            <p> The cops recoil from the stench. Somerset steps up, putting his<br>
              gun away.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Victor?</p>
            <p> BLACK COP<br>
              What the hell... ?</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              (to Somerset)<br>
              Check this out, Dick...</p>
            <p> California points with his gun to the end of the man's right arm.<br>
              The hand is gone, severed at the wrist long ago.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              It is Victor.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (points to a cop)<br>
              Call an ambulance.</p>
            <p> The blond cop enters from the other room.</p>
            <p> BLOND COP<br>
              What the fuck is this?</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              Somebody call a hearse, more like.</p>
            <p> The female cop has gone to one wall where a sheet is pinned up.<br>
              She pulls the sheet down. Pinned behind the sheet are fifty-two<br>
              Polaroid pictures; all pictures of Victor tied to the bed, with 
              a<br>
              date written at the bottom of each picture. It is a visual history 
              of Victor's physical decay.</p>
            <p> BLOND COP<br>
              What is going on?</p>
            <p> Mills sees the female cop looking at the pictures.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Hey, California, get your people out.</p>
            <p> Somerset takes out rubber gloves and puts them on.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              You heard him. Hit the hall, and don't touch anything.</p>
            <p> Somerset replaces the sheet over Victor, but not over his head.</p>
            <p> The cops file out and Mills goes to examine the pictures.<br>
              California stays by the bed with Somerset.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              It looks like he's some kind of friggin' sculpture or something.</p>
            <p> Somerset places his finger along Victor's throat.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Somerset, you... you better look here.</p>
            <p> Mills looks at the photos in awe. Somerset joins him.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              All pictures of Victor tied to the bed.<br>
              (crouches, points)<br>
              The last one is dated three days ago.</p>
            <p> Somerset looks at the first photo. In it, Victor is bound and 
              gagged, but he is healthy.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              The first one... it's dated one year ago.<br>
              To the day.</p>
            <p> Somerset wipes his pale face.</p>
            <p> Californian stands by the corpse, behind Somerset and Mills. He<br>
              lifts the sheet on the bed to look under it.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              Mother...</p>
            <p> Mills kneels and lifts the sheet which had covered the pictures<br>
              off the floor. There is an open shoebox underneath.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What...?</p>
            <p> On the side of the box: TO THE DETECTIVES, FROM ME.</p>
            <p> California leans close to Victor's gaunt, blindfolded face,<br>
              examining with morbid curiosity.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              You got what you deserved, Victor.</p>
            <p> Somerset leans down beside Mills. Mills looks through the<br>
              shoebox. Inside are plastic, zip-lock bags.</p>
            <p> One contains small clumps of hair. One contains a yellow liquid...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (looking at bags)<br>
              A urine sample, hair sample... stool sample. Finger nails...<br>
              (looks to Somerset)<br>
              He laughing at us.</p>
            <p> California is still close to Victor's face, when suddenly Victor's 
              lips twist open and Victor lets out a loud, guttural bark.</p>
            <p> California jerks back, shouting in fear, falling over a chair 
              to the floor.</p>
            <p> Mills and Somerset reel. They see California on the ground, scared 
              out of his mind, pointing.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              He's alive!</p>
            <p> Somerset and Mills look towards the bed.</p>
            <p> Victor's lips move feebly as he lets out a sick, gurgling moan.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              He's still alive!!</p>
            <p>62 EXT. SLUM APARTMENT BUILDING -- MORNING 62</p>
            <p> A crowd has gathered at the entrance. Mills' car, the police van<br>
              and two ambulances are parked on the sidewalk.</p>
            <p>63 INT. SLUM HALLWAY -- MORNING 63</p>
            <p> The cops are in the hall holding neighbors at bay.</p>
            <p>64 INT. SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING 64</p>
            <p> Three ambulance attendants are at the bed, working on Victor.<br>
              One attendant uses wire cutters to clip Victor's bonds.</p>
            <p>65 INT. SLUM STAIRWELL -- MORNING 65</p>
            <p> Mills and Somerset are standing in the middle of one flight of 
              stairs. Both are highly agitated.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, 
              but we may have underestimated thid guy.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I want him bad. I don't just want to catch him anymore. I want to 
              hurt him.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Listen to me. He's all about playing games.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              No kidding! No fucking kidding!</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here. No matter how hard 
              it is, we have to stay focused on the details.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.</p>
            <p> Mills is looking at the floor, still burning. Somerset grabs him<br>
              by the jacket.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Are you listening to me?</p>
            <p> Mills pushes Somerset's hand off.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I hear you.</p>
            <p> There is a sudden, brilliant FLASH OF LIGHT and the SOUND of a<br>
              CAMERA ADVANCING. Mills and Somerset look.</p>
            <p> Down the stairs, a REPORTER has his camera up, pointed at them.</p>
            <p> REPORTER<br>
              Say cheese.</p>
            <p> He take another picture, flashbulb flashing.</p>
            <p> Mills goes down the stairs, grabs the reporter, a balding, almost<br>
              silly looking man with thick glasses and wrinkled clothing.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What the fuck are you doing here?</p>
            <p> The reporter squirms, holds up a laminated press pass on a cord<br>
              around his neck.</p>
            <p> REPORTER<br>
              I have a right, Officer. I...</p>
            <p> Mills shoves him, and the reporter stumbles a few steps, then<br>
              falls to the landing below with a thud.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              That doesn't mean anything! This is a closed crime scene!</p>
            <p> Somerset comes to pull Mills back. The shaken reporter stands<br>
              uneasily.</p>
            <p> REPORTER<br>
              You can't do this! You can't...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Get the fuck out of here!</p>
            <p> The reporter scrambles down the nest flight, out of sight.</p>
            <p> REPORTER (o.s.)<br>
              The public has a right to know!</p>
            <p> Somerset yanks Mills back harder, till Mills sits on the stairs.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              How do those cockroaches get here so quick?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (calming)<br>
              Sorry about that... I just...</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (sarcastic)<br>
              Oh, it's alright.</p>
            <p> Somerset starts back up the stairs.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              It's always impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions.</p>
            <p>66 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY 66</p>
            <p> Somerset and Mills are with DOCTOR BEARDSLEY. Victor lies inside 
              an oxygen tent with tubes running into him. The room is dim.</p>
            <p> DOCTOR<br>
              A year of immobility seems about right, judging by the deterioration 
              of the muscles and the spine. Blood tests show a whole smorgasbord 
              of drugs in his systems; from crack to heroin... even an antibiotic 
              which must have been administered to keep the bed sores from infecting.</p>
            <p> Mills looks into the oxygen tent.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              He hasn't said anything, or tried to express himself in any way?</p>
            <p> DOCTOR<br>
              Even if his brain were not mush, which it is... he chewed off his 
              own tongue long ago.</p>
            <p> Mills winces, moves away from the bed.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              There's no way he'll survive?</p>
            <p> DOCTOR<br>
              Detective, he'd die right how of shock if you were to shine a flashlight 
              in his eyes.</p>
            <p> Silence for a moment, the the doctor lets out a chuckle.</p>
            <p> DOCTOR<br>
              It's funny to think... he's experienced about as much pain and suffering 
              as anyone I've encountered... give or take... and he<br>
              still has hell to look forward to.</p>
            <p> He chuckles again, engrossed in some information on a clipboard.<br>
              Mills looks to Somerset like, &quot;this guy's nuts.&quot;</p>

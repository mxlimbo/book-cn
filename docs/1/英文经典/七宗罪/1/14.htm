              94 INT. WILD BILL'S LEATHER SHOP -- DAY 94</p>
            <p> Mills and Somerset are on one side of the counter and WILD BILL<br>
              is on the other. Wild Bill is shirtless and covered in tattoos.<br>
              He has a thick scar running down the center of his forehead and<br>
              down his cheek. leather belts, whips and jackets hang on the<br>
              walls and from the ceiling.</p>
            <p> WILD BILL<br>
              Yeah, he picked it up last night.</p>
            <p> Wild Bill holds the pink receipt from John Doe's apartment.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              This was definitely him?</p>
            <p> Mills points to the rendering of John Doe he holds.</p>
            <p> WILD BILL<br>
              Yeah, John Doe. Easy name to remember.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              What was this job you did for him?</p>
            <p> WILD BILL<br>
              I got a picture of it here. It's a real<br>
              sweet piece...</p>
            <p> Wild Bill pulls a box from behind the counter, digs in it.</p>
            <p> WILD BILL<br>
              I figured he must be one of those performance artists. That's what 
              I<br>
              figured.<br>
              (MORE)</p>
            <p> WILD BILL (cont'd)<br>
              Like one of those guys who pisses in a cup on stage and drinks it. 
              Performance art.</p>
            <p> Wild Bill hands a Polaroid picture to Mills. We do not see the<br>
              picture yet.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Oh... give me a break.</p>
            <p> WILD BILL<br>
              I think I undercharged him.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (looks at photo)<br>
              You built this for him? Youbuild this?</p>
            <p> WILD BILL<br>
              I've built weirder shit than that. So what?</p>
            <p> A POLICEMAN enters the store.</p>
            <p> POLICEMAN<br>
              Detectives... we have a situation.</p>
            <p> Mills and Somerset follow the cop out.</p>
            <p> WILD BILL<br>
              Hey, my picture... !</p>
            <p> Wild Bill watches them go, scratches his thick scar.</p>
            <p> WILD BILL<br>
              Fucking pigs.</p>
            <p>95 EXT. THE HOT HOUSE MASSAGE PARLOUR -- DAY 95</p>
            <p> It's a madhouse outside The Hot House, a bright red storefront<br>
              bordered on both sides by porno theater after porno theater. A<br>
              crowd is gathered around a police action in progress.</p>
            <p> Cops have formed a barrier, holding back the crowd and creating<br>
              an aisle from the entrance of The Hot House to the back of a<br>
              jail-van. Cops and detectives are escorting various men, women<br>
              and transvestites into the large vehicle. The crowd, consisting<br>
              of the dregs of society, is shouting. Some people are spitting<br>
              and throwing trash at the cops.</p>
            <p>96 INT. THE HOT HOUSE, RECEPTION AREA -- DAY 96</p>
            <p> TWO COPS are in front of a glass and steel cage. Inside the cage<br>
              is a fat, BALD MAN with a wall of sex toys behind him.</p>
            <p> BALD MAN<br>
              Just wait! Just wait!</p>
            <p> One cop pounds his nightstick against the glass.</p>
            <p> COP<br>
              Get out of the fucking booth!</p>
            <p> BALD MAN<br>
              Just wait! I'll come out, just wait!</p>
            <p>97 INT. THE HOT HOUSE, CORRIDORS -- DAY 97</p>
            <p> All the lights are red and the walls are painted red. Mills and<br>
              Somerset follow a THIRD COP through the twisting corridors.<br>
              POLICEMEN can be HEARD SHOUTING and MAKING ARRESTS. ROCK MUSIC<br>
              PLAYS, throbbing. They come to a door.</p>
            <p> THIRD COP<br>
              I don't want to go in there again.</p>
            <p>98 INT. RED ROOM -- DAY 98</p>
            <p> Mills and Somerset enter. ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES, LOUD. A strobe 
              light flashes from the ceiling. TWO AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS are in 
              the room. The first attendant is placing a sheet over a bed, hiding 
              the corpse of a blonde woman. The second attendant is trying to 
              examine the pupils of a CRAZED MAN, 55, who is naked and wrapped 
              in a sheet. A SWEATING COP holds crazed man down.</p>
            <p> CRAZED MAN<br>
              He... he... he made me do it!</p>
            <p> SECOND ATTENDANT<br>
              I have to look at you. I have to look at you!</p>
            <p> LUST is scratched into the red paint on the wall in big letters.</p>
            <p> Mills and Somerset move towards the covered body.</p>
            <p> FIRST ATTENDANT<br>
              (to Mills and Somerset)<br>
              You're not going to want to see this more than once.</p>
            <p> CRAZED MAN<br>
              He had a gun! He made me do it!</p>
            <p> The sheet is lifted for the detectives. They grimace at what they 
              see. We do not see. Somerset closes his eyes and turns away. The 
              first attendant replaces the sheet.</p>
            <p> Mills steps back, takes out his handkerchief and sucks on it. 
              He<br>
              looks at the crazed man. The crazed man jerks around while the<br>
              second attendant preps a needle.</p>
            <p> SECOND ATTENDANT<br>
              He's in shock, man. He's gone.</p>
            <p> CRAZED MAN<br>
              Take this thing off me... take it off!<br>
              Please, take this thing off me!</p>
            <p> The sweating cop keeps his controlling grip on the crazed man.</p>
            <p> CRAZED MAN<br>
              Get it off... oh, God!</p>
            <p> SWEATING COP<br>
              (to Mills and Somerset)<br>
              You're the detectives, right? Right?<br>
              Well, you'd better see this!</p>
            <p> Somerset's facing the wall. Crazed man's still yelling.</p>
            <p> SWEATING COP<br>
              Hey... you better see what's strapped onto this guy!</p>
            <p> Mills turns to the cop.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              We've already seen it!</p>
            <p>99 INT. SANATORIUM, WHITE ROOM -- DAY 99</p>
            <p> A Polaroid photograph on a white table. It is the photo Wild<br>
              Bill gave to Mills. It's a picture of a belt, made with extra<br>
              leather straps so it can be worn securely around the groin. It<br>
              is a strap-on phallus, except there is no plastic protuberance.<br>
              Instead, there is a metal knife -- it's a strap-on butcher's<br>
              knife.</p>
            <p> CRAZED MAN<br>
              And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married. And, 
              I could see he had a gun in his hand.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Where was the girl?</p>
            <p> CRAZED MAN<br>
              What? What?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Where was the prostitute? Where was she?</p>
            <p> The crazed man leans forward in his chair.</p>
            <p> CRAZED MAN<br>
              She was... she was on the bed. She was just sitting on the bed.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Who tied her down? You or him?</p>
            <p> CRAZED MAN<br>
              He had a gun. He had a gun... and he made it happen. He made me 
              do it!<br>
              (MORE)</p>
            <p> CRAZED MAN (cont'd)<br>
              (sobbing)<br>
              He made me put that... that thing on. Oh, Christ! He made me wear 
              it... and... and he told me to fuck her. He had the gun in my mouth.</p>
            <p> The man slides to the floor and hides his face in his hands.</p>
            <p> CRAZED MAN<br>
              The gun was in my throat!</p>
            <p> Somerset looks up at the mirror in his room. He stands and picks<br>
              up the Polarois as two men in institutional uniforms enter to<br>
              collect the crazed man from the floor.</p>
            <p>100 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY 100</p>
            <p> Mills stands in this dirty room with the dirty, bald man from 
              The<br>
              Hot House's reception area booth.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You didn't hear any screams? Nothing? You didn't notice when this 
              man walked in with a package under his arm?!</p>
            <p> BALD MAN<br>
              No, I didn't.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You didn't notice anything wrong? Nothing seemed strange to you?</p>
            <p> BALD MAN<br>
              Everybody who goes in there has a package under his arm. Some guys 
              are carrying suitcases full of stuff. And, screams?<br>
              There're screams coming out of there everyday. It goes with the 
              territory, little boy!</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You like what you do for a living? You like the things you see?</p>
            <p> The bald man smiles strangely.</p>
            <p> BALD MAN<br>
              No. No, I don't. But, that's life.</p>
            <p>101 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING 101</p>
            <p> The blackboard:</p>
            <p> 1 gluttony (x) 5 wrath<br>
              2 greed (x) 6 pride<br>
              3 sloth (x) 7 lust (x)<br>
              4 envy</p>
            <p> Somerset and Mills are shell-shocked, silent, seated at their<br>
              desks. Somerset is looking at the blackboard. Mills is looking<br>
              at the billboard out the window.</p>
            <p>102 INT. SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT 102</p>
            <p> Somerset and Mills sit with a full pitcher of beer. The jukebox<br>
              plays for the other customers. The walls of the bar are covered<br>
              with trophies, plaques and other victory symbols.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come 
              home and read me these morbid crime stories. Murders in the Rue 
              Morgue. Le Fanu's Green Tea. My mother would give him hell because 
              he was<br>
              keeping me up till all hours.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              One birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book, &quot;The 
              Century of the Detective,&quot; by Jurgen Thorwald. It traced<br>
              the history of deduction as a science, and it sealed my fate, because 
              it was real, not fiction. And, that a drop of blood or a piece of 
              hair could solve a crime... it was incredible to me.</p>
            <p> Somerset drinks, then pours more beer.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this. It's 
              not possible anymore.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              If we get him, I'll be happy enough.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              No. Face it now. Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              How can you say that? Especially after today?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll 
              go blind. There's no winning and losing here.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten 
              his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have 
              to wash the blood off their children. You put the killer in jail. 
              Who won?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You do your job...</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Where's the victory?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction. 
              If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned 
              out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations. 
              No<br>
              human being could do these things, right?<br>
              But, this is not the devil. It's just a man.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while?<br>
              You bitch and complain... if I thought like<br>
              you, I would have slit my wrist already.</p>
            <p> Somerset sits back, looking at Mills.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead? You think 
              you're toughening me up? Well, you're not! You're quitting, fine... 
              but I'm staying.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              People don't want a champion. They just want to keep playing the 
              lottery and eating hamburgers.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What the fuck is wrong with you? What burnt you out?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean. I just... I can't 
              live here anymore.<br>
              I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were 
              a virtue.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right? No one's worthy 
              of you.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Wrong! I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, 
              if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you...<br>
              you become like John Doe. It's easier to beat a child than it is 
              to raise it, because it takes so much work to love. You just have 
              to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, 
              because you'll risk being sad. Keep ignoring.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You're talking about people who are mentally ill. You're...</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              No I'm not! I'm talking about common, everyday life here. If you 
              let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, 
              and the next, and it never ends.<br>
              In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Listen to yourself. You say, &quot;the problem with people is they 
              don't care, so I don't care about people.&quot; But, you're already 
              here. You've been here a long time. So, there's a part of you that 
              knows, even if<br>
              everything you say is true, none of it matters.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              That part of me is dead.</p>
            <p> Mills stands.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You want me to agree with you: &quot;Yeah, you're right, Somerset. 
              This is a fucked place. Let's go live in a fucking log cabin.&quot; 
              Well, I don't agree with you.<br>
              You're giving up, and it makes me sick, because you're the best 
              I've ever seen.</p>
            <p> Mills throws some money on the table.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Thanks for the beer.</p>
            <p> Mills leaves, other patrons watching him.</p>
            <p> Somerset takes out a cigarette and goes to light it. The lighter<br>
              will not light, and when it does, Somerset's hand is trembling.</p>

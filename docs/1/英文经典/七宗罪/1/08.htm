              51 INT. LAW OFFICE -- NIGHT 51</p>
            <p> The male forensic from the gluttony murder scene is here. He has<br>
              a magnifying glass which he's using to study a very clear fingerprint 
              in black powder on the wall.</p>
            <p> MALE FORENSIC<br>
              Oh, man...</p>
            <p> MILLS (o.s.)<br>
              Talk to me.</p>
            <p> The male forensic bites his lip, still studying.</p>
            <p> Mills and Somerset are watching the forensic who works O.S.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (to Somerset)<br>
              Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been 
              involved in anything like this?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> MALE FORENSIC (o.s.)<br>
              Well, I can tell you, boys...</p>
            <p> The forensic steps down from a stool. Behind him, where the<br>
              painting once was, are fingerprints, clear and distinct. The prints 
              have been left, one after the other, to form letters which form 
              words: HELP ME.</p>
            <p> MALE FORENSIC<br>
              ... just by looking at the shape of the underloop on these, they 
              are NOT the victim's fingerprints.</p>
            <p>52 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, PRINT LAB -- NIGHT 52</p>
            <p> Dark. A TECHNICIAN sits before an old computer. The computer's<br>
              green screen shows enlarged fingerprint patterns being aligned,<br>
              compares, and then rejected: whir - click - whir - click - whir 
              -<br>
              click. Mills and Somerset watch, bathed in a green glow.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              He just may be nuts enough.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              It doesn't fit. He doesn't want us to help him stop.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Who the hell knows? There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty 
              deeds they don't want to do. You know... little voices tell them 
              bad things.</p>
            <p> Somerset doesn't buy it. The technician adjusts a knob, then turns 
              to the detectives.</p>
            <p> TECHNICIAN<br>
              I've seen this baby take as long as three days to make a match, 
              so you guys can go cross your fingers somewhere else.</p>
            <p>53 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT 53</p>
            <p> Somerset and Mills come out from the Print Lab. A janitor is<br>
              mopping the hall. The computer is HEARD WHIRing AND CLICKing<br>
              onwards. Somerset sits with a groan on a couch outside the lab<br>
              door. Mills flops beside him.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you? About catching 
              this guy. You really want to believe that, don't you?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              And you don't?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (laughs, very tired)<br>
              I wish I still thought like you.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              All we do is pick up the pieces. We take all the evidence, and all 
              the pictures and samples. We write everything down and note what 
              time things happened...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Oh, that's all.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance 
              it's ever needed in a courtroom.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island. You keep them 
              just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out 
              there.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Bullshit.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only 
              to other clues.<br>
              I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I've seen the same. I'm not the country hick you seem to think I 
              am.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... 
              if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more 
              room for the living.</p>
            <p> Somerset slumps back, takes out a cigarette and lights it.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Don't tell me you didn't get that rush tonight... that adrenalin, 
              like we were getting somewhere.</p>
            <p> Mills sits back on the couch, closes his eyes.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              And, don't try to tell me it was because you found something that 
              would play well in a courtroom.</p>
            <p> Somerset looks at Mills, who crosses his arms to sleep. Somerset<br>
              puffs the cigarette.</p>
            <p> The computer is heard: whir - click - whir - click...</p>
            <p> INSERT -- TITLE CARD</p>
            <p> THURSDAY</p>
            <p>54 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, HALLWAY -- EARLY MORNING 54</p>
            <p> Mills and Somerset are fast asleep on the couch, leaning against<br>
              each other. People pass and look at them strangely. A man steps<br>
              in front of the couch. He reaches with both hands to slap their<br>
              faces simultaneously.</p>
            <p> It's the captain leaning over them.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Wake up, Glimmer Twins. We have a winner.</p>
            <p>55 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, READY ROOM -- EARLY MORNING 55</p>
            <p> A windowless classroom. The captain stands at a podium in front<br>
              with a white screen at his side. A mug-shot of a man, VICTOR,<br>
              25, is projected onto the screen from a slide projector.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              He goes by the name Victor, as many of you know, and his prints 
              were found on scene by Detectives Mills and Somerset.</p>
            <p> FIVE hardened POLICE OFFICERS, four men and one woman, sit in 
              chairs facing the captain. The all wear bullet-proof vests with<br>
              the word POLICE spray-painted across them.</p>
            <p> Somerset and Mills sit in back, drinking coffee, still asleep.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Now, this guy's a real beauty. He has a long, long history of serious 
              mental illness. According the head-shrinkers, it seems his parents 
              gave him a very strict, Southern Baptist upbringing, but somewhere<br>
              along the line he dropped his marbles.</p>
            <p> Two of the cops in the front row are talking.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Hey, you two can shut-up now!</p>
            <p> The two cops separate like huge, embarassed school children.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Thank you, fuckheads. Now, Victor spent a couple of months in prison 
              for the attempted rape of an eight year old boy, but his lawyer 
              made sure he didn't stay long. Before that, he dabbled in drugs,<br>
              armed robbery and assault.<br>
              (MORE)</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN (cont'd)<br>
              We've been doing our best to keep an eye on him, but he's been out 
              of circulation for a while.</p>
            <p> FEMALE COP<br>
              If he disappeared, what do you want from us?</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              His last place of residence is still in his name. A search warrant 
              is being pushed through the courts as we speak.</p>
            <p> A red-headed cop, CALIFORNIA, raises his hand.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              So, have the housing cops walk up and ring the doorbell.</p>
            <p> The cops laugh. The captain is clenching his jaw, angry.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Listen, California. When you go in, if Victor isn't home, one of 
              his buddies might be house-sitting, so you go in guns first.<br>
              Besides using, Victor deals, and we know what kind of crowd he runs 
              with.</p>
            <p> There is some chatter amongst the cops.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              This is what the D.A. has a hard-on for right now, Ladies and Germs, 
              so we do not question why.</p>
            <p> Mills leans to Somerset while the captain continues the briefing.<br>
              They whisper.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Does this make it with you?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Doesn't seem like our man, does it?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You tell me. I'm new in town.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              He doesn't have the desire somehow. Our killer seems to have more 
              purpose. More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              The fingerprints.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Yes. They were there... so, it must be.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              We'll tag along.</p>
            <p> Somerset wants no part of that.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Why would we?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (smiles)<br>
              Satisfy our curiosity?</p>
            <p>56 INT. MILLS' CAR -- MORNING 56</p>
            <p> Mills drives, follows a police van. Somerset rides shotgun.<br>
              Mills seems pumped and ready. Somerset takes two Rolaids off a<br>
              fresh roll and chews them.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You ever take one?</p>
            <p> Somerset takes out his gun, opens it to check the load.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood. I've only ever taken 
              my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it. Never 
              fired it though. Not once.<br>
              (closes his gun)<br>
              You?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Never took a bullet. I pulled my gun once.<br>
              fired it once.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              And?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              It was my first one of these. We were a secondary unit, and I was 
              pretty shaky going in. I was still considered a rookie.</p>
            <p> Mills takes a corner, tires screeching.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              We busted the door, looking for this junkie, right? The geek just 
              opened fire.<br>
              Another cop was hit in the arm and he went flying... like in slow 
              motion.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              I remember riding in the ambulance. His arm was like Jello. A piece 
              of meat. He bled to death right there.</p>
            <p> A pause.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              How did the fire fight end?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I got him. I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good 
              up till then. Lots of street busts. I've always had this weird luck... 
              everything always went my way, but this was wild.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              I got him with one shot... right between the eyes. Next thing I 
              know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me. Picture in the paper, whole 
              nine yards.</p>
            <p> Somerset unrolls the window, feels the air across his face.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              How was it?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I expected it to be bad, you know. I took a human life... but I 
              slept like a baby that night. I never gave it a second thought.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET <br>
              I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but 
              he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to 
              have the ability to kill. I think he meant you truly must be able 
              to do it, not just faking it, too survive.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.</p>
            <p>57 INT. SLUM BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- MORNING 57</p>
            <p> The five cops from the briefing, fully geared up and ready, rifles 
              and handguns out, move quickly up the stairs in single file. Somerset 
              and Mills follow, guns out. Somerset is sweating bullets. Mills 
              is wild eyed, juiced.</p>
            <p> Crack viles and hypodermic needles on the stairs crunch under 
              the<br>
              cops' heavy boots.</p>
            <p>58 INT. SLUM HALLWAY -- MORNING 58</p>
            <p> The cops enter the dank hall. The move cautiously. A man is<br>
              lying on the floor, looking up, helpless, with dead eyes.</p>
            <p> A door opens and a woman peeks out. The female cop points her<br>
              gun and the door slams. California, leading the group, steps up<br>
              to apartment 303. He has a search warrant scotch-taped to the<br>
              front of his bullet-proof vest.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              (to black cop)<br>
              This is it. Give it up.</p>
            <p> The black cop hoists a heavy battering ram to California. The<br>
              other cops get on both sides of the door. Somerset and Mills<br>
              hang back a few feet, watching their backs.</p>
            <p> BLACK COP<br>
              (points to Mills)<br>
              Cops go before Dicks.</p>
            <p> Many people are sticking their heads out of doors in the hall.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              Police! Open the door!!</p>
            <p> California brings the ram forward with a splintering THUD -- once<br>
              -- twice -- the door flies open. The cops storm in.</p>
            <p>59 INT. SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING 59</p>
            <p> The apartment is incredibly dusty. The cops charge down the<br>
              short hall into this room where a bed sits against the far wall.<br>
              California moves up to the bed. Someone lies under the sheets.<br>
              Three other cops move, all training their weapon on the bed.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              Good morning, sweetheart!</p>
            <p> A blond cop goes into another room. California moves closer to<br>
              the bed, gun up.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              Get up, now, motherfucker! NOW!</p>

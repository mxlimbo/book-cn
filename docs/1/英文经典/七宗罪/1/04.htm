              <br>
              24 EXT. CITY STREET -- DAY 24</p>
            <p> A newspaper vendor lays out a pile of tabloid newspapers at the<br>
              front of his busy newsstand.</p>
            <p> The papers' headline is: BIZARRE MURDER!, in huge, black print.</p>
            <p> The vendor lays out another tabloid pile. Headline: &quot;EAT 
              OR DIE&quot;<br>
              SAYS GLUTTONY KILLER!!, in big, red letters.</p>
            <p> The vendor throws down a third tabloid stack. SICKENING<br>
              MURDER -- EXCLUSIVE DETAILS INSIDE!, it reads.</p>
            <p>25 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- DAY 25</p>
            <p> The office is old, with a single window which faces a billboard.<br>
              TRAFFIC is HEARD from outside. There are moving boxes on the<br>
              floor. Somerset is at his desk with paperwork in two sloppy<br>
              piles. He uses a manual typewriter, filling in a yellow form.<br>
              He types hunt-and-peck, slowly. He finsihes the form and pulls<br>
              it out. There is a knock at the door.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Come in.</p>
            <p> The captain pushes the door and stands in the doorway with a<br>
              PAINTER/WORKMAN at his side.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Excuse us. We have some business to take care of.</p>
            <p> As always, the neatly groomed captain clenches his jaw.</p>
            <p> Somerset lines a new form in the typewriter, starts typing.</p>
            <p> The captain strolls in. Two boxes sit on the floor with DETECTIVE 
              MILLS written across them. He picks up one of the boxes and sets 
              it on top of the other.</p>
            <p> At the open door, the workman takes a razor blade from his kit.<br>
              He brings it against the writing on the glass of the door:<br>
              DETECTIVE SOMERSET. The workman pushes the razor to start<br>
              scraping the name away, and the razor on glass sounds like<br>
              fingernails on a blackboard.</p>
            <p> Somerset looks up.</p>
            <p> WORKMAN<br>
              Sorry.</p>
            <p> Somerset turns back to the typing, hunt-and-peck. The captain<br>
              watches. The workman continues.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Have you heard?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (not looking up)<br>
              No, I haven't heard.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              There was a second.</p>
            <p> Somerset stops, looks at the captain.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Already.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Greed. It was written in blood.</p>
            <p> Somerset thinks about this, then turns to type.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              It's none of my business anymore.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              I thought you might want to be filled in.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I'm sure everyone's doing their best.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Yeah.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Good.</p>
            <p> Hunt-and-peck. The captain's jowls clamp. He steps up to Somerset's 
              desk, begins to straighten the two piles of forms.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Come on. What are you going to do with yourself out there?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I'll get a job, maybe on a farm. I'll work on the house.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Can't you feel it yet? Can't you feel that feeling... ? You're not 
              going to be a cop anymore.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              What are you talking about?</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              You know.</p>
            <p> Somerset reclines, facing the captain.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his 
              dog? he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken. And 
              then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed 
              him<br>
              with a knife in both eyes. It happened four blocks from here.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              I heard.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I have no understanding of this place anymore.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              It's always been like this.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Really?</p>
            <p> Somerset saddles up to the typewriter.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Maybe you're right.</p>
            <p> The captain lays the paperwork down. Both piles are now neat.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              You do this work. You were made for it, and I don't think you can 
              deny that. I certainly can't believe you're trading it in for a 
              tool belt and a fishing rod.<br>
              (pause, walks to leave)<br>
              Maybe I'm wrong.</p>
            <p> The captain leaves. Somerset looks up. He grabs the paperwork<br>
              piles and ruffles them back to their disheveled state. He looks 
              up at the workman.</p>
            <p> The workman is looking at Somerset, has a rag in his hand to remove 
              the last remnants of Somerset's name.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (angrily)<br>
              Try putting a little elbow grease into it.</p>
            <p> The workman is startled, continues his work.</p>
            <p>26 INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- LATE NIGHT 26</p>
            <p> There is a dart board on one wall. THWACK -- Somerset's<br>
              switchblade hits the board and embeds.</p>
            <p> Somerset crosses the nearly empty living room and takes the blade<br>
              from the dart board. He walks back to stand in front of the only<br>
              chair in the room. He throws the switchblade.</p>
            <p> It embeds in the dart board. Somerset sits.</p>
            <p> He picks a book off the floor and holds it in his lap. KIDS can<br>
              be HEARD CURSING and playing LOUD MUSIC from outside the<br>
              shuttered window. Somerset stares at the ceiling. He opens the<br>
              book and looks at the pages... stares at the pages...</p>
            <p> He puts the book back down on the floor.</p>
            <p>27 EXT. CITY STREET -- LATE NIGHT 27</p>
            <p> Somerset gets out of his car. He walks down the sidewalk with 
              a<br>
              notebook in hand. THUNDER is HEARD. He takes a cigarette out of<br>
              a full pack and lights it.</p>
            <p> He walks along the avenue. Cars race by in the street. People<br>
              walk briskly past. At a public phone, a man shouts curses<br>
              angrily into the phone, then starts pounding the phone box with<br>
              the receiver. A fire engine passes in the street, sirens, horn<br>
              and lights going full blast.</p>
            <p> Somerset starts up a flight of massive stone stairs, past several<br>
              sleeping vagrants. One VAGRANT sits up and looks to Somerset.</p>
            <p> VAGRANT<br>
              Spare me a cigarette? Spare a cigarette?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Sorry, last one.</p>
            <p> Ahead of Somerset, the library looms, a solid, powerful structure.</p>
            <p>28 INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY, MAIN LIBRARY -- LATE NIGHT 28</p>
            <p> Somerset and GEORGE, 62, the night guard, enter the vast space 
              of<br>
              the deserted main library.</p>
            <p> The lamps hanging from the ceiling give off a warm, pleasant glow<br>
              over mahogany tables and chairs. To each side of this center<br>
              area are tall bookshelves. Balconies surround the room on all<br>
              four sides; three levels which overlook the center.</p>
            <p> Somerset is happy. This is his element, this peaceful, elegant<br>
              place. George motions to the long, empty tables.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Sit where you'd like.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Thanks, George.</p>
            <p> MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)<br>
              Hey there, Smilely.</p>
            <p> Somerset looks up to the top balcony where TWO OTHER SECURITY<br>
              GUARDS and one JANITOR look over the banister.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Evening, gentlemen.</p>
            <p> They all say their hellos.</p>
            <p> FIRST GUARD<br>
              Come on, George. Cards are getting cold.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              (to Somerset)<br>
              Duty calls.</p>
            <p> George pumps Somerset's hand, then moves to a stairwell leading<br>
              to the balconies. Somerset walks down the main aisle, looks<br>
              around at the shelves and shelves of books.</p>
            <p> George reaches the top balcony and the others sit at a card table<br>
              where a poker game is in progress.</p>
            <p> Somerset puts his notebook down on one table and switches on a<br>
              green banker's lamp. THUNDER SOUNDS. Somerset looks up.</p>
            <p> Rain is beginning to fall on the windows of the high ceiling.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (shouts up)<br>
              All these books, gentlemen... a world of knowledge at your disposal, 
              and you play poker all night.</p>
            <p> UP ON THE BALCONY</p>
            <p> George has taken a huge BOOM-BOX from a broom closet.</p>
            <p> JANITOR<br>
              We got culture.</p>
            <p> SECOND GUARD<br>
              (dealing cards)<br>
              Yeah, we got culture coming out our asses.</p>
            <p> They laugh. George sets the boom-box against the railing of the<br>
              balcony so the speakers face towards Somerset.</p>
            <p> DOWN ON THE MAIN FLOOR</p>
            <p> Somerset has gone into one bookshelf aisle. Poker table<br>
              conversation echoes from above. Somerset searches books, reading<br>
              spines. He finds one book and pulls it, continues searching.</p>
            <p> UP ON THE BALCONY</p>
            <p> George hits play on the boom-box and turns the volume way up.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              How's this for culture?</p>
            <p> DOWN ON THE MAIN FLOOR</p>
            <p> Somerset keeps looking for books. From far away come the strains<br>
              of MOZART MUSIC filling the air. High, drifting music, such as<br>
              AIR (On the G string.) Somerset stops, listens.</p>
            <p> He closes his eyes and soaks it in.</p>
            <p> UP ON THE BALCONY</p>
            <p> George sits at the card table, takes out a cigar and lights up.<br>
              He looks to the ground floor.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Where'd you get to, Smilely?</p>
            <p> Below, Somerset comes out from the aisle.</p>
            <p> DOWN ON THE MAIN FLOOR</p>
            <p> Somerset looks up at George.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p>29 INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY, MAIN LIBRARY -- LATER NIGHT 29</p>
            <p> MUSIC CONTINUES, spinning through the air like a slow, cool<br>
              breeze.</p>
            <p> Somerset walks, surrounded by books, carrying several. He pulls<br>
              another off a shelf and adds it to his pile.</p>
            <p> UP ON THE BALCONY</p>
            <p> George lays down a winning hand. The others toss in their cards<br>
              in disgust. George laughs, spouting cigar smoke.</p>
            <p> Cigar smoke floats up in the air, thinning gracefully. Above,<br>
              rain continues dancing on the ceiling windows.</p>
            <p> DOWN ON THE MAIN FLOOR</p>
            <p> Somerset sits, opens a book on the table and reads.</p>
            <p>30 INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM/LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 30</p>
            <p> MUSIC CONTINUES, uninterupted over this scene. Music so pretty<br>
              it is almost sad. Tracy, in a nightgown, sits up in bed, tense,<br>
              She throws off the covers and goes to the door.</p>
            <p> She stands looking into the living room where Mills is at a desk.</p>
            <p> Mills sorts through paperwork and photos with his back to Tracy.<br>
              A basketball game is on the television, but he pays it no mind.<br>
              He sits forward, obviously frustrated, drinks coffee. He does<br>
              not know Tracy is there.</p>
            <p> Tracy watches her husband, concerned.</p>

              <br>
              147 EXT. MARSHLANDS, INDUSTRIAL ROAD -- EARLY EVENING 147</p>
            <p> Somerset stumbles backwards, away from the open box. He is white<br>
              as a sheet, eyes filled with numb fear. He leans against his car<br>
              for support, wretches, sick, holds the back of his hand to his<br>
              mouth.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              No...</p>
            <p>148 EXT. MARSHLANDS -- EARLY EVENING 148</p>
            <p> Mills is watching Somerset, grabs John Doe by the shirt.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Get up. Stand up! Let's go!</p>
            <p> Doe stands, tries to walk. Mills is walking quickly, towards<br>
              Somerset. Doe can't keep up.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              You've made a good life for yourself...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Shut up!</p>
            <p> Doe falls and Mills starts dragging him through the reeds.</p>
            <p>149 EXT. MARSHLANDS, INDUSTRIAL ROAD -- EARLY EVENING 149</p>
            <p> Somerset wipes saliva from his lips and tears from his eyes. He<br>
              takes a deep breath, looks to see Mills dragging Doe.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Oh, fuck, no...</p>
            <p> Somerset straightens, tries to pull himself together. He<br>
              swallows, draws his gun.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (into hidden mic)<br>
              Listen... listen to me. Whatever you do...<br>
              don't come in here. Stay away. No matter<br>
              what you hear, do not move in!<br>
              (starts towards Mills)<br>
              John Doe has the upper hand.</p>
            <p> Somerset picks up his switchblade and flips the blade back in.<br>
              He enters the marsh.</p>
            <p>150 EXT. MARSHLANDS -- EARLY EVENING<br>
              150</p>
            <p> Mills sees Somerset coming and pulls Doe so that Doe stands.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              (quietly, watching)<br>
              Here he comes.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (shouts to Somerset)<br>
              What the fuck is going on?</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              (to Mills)<br>
              I want you to know, I wish I could have<br>
              lived like you do.</p>
            <p> Somerset starts running towards Mills, mud splattering.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Mills... put down your gun! Throw it away!</p>
            <p> Mills leaves Doe behind, walks towards Somerset, gun down.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> Somerset is fifty yards away and closing.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Throw your gun down now!</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What are you talking about? What happened?</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              Are you listening to me, Detective Mills?<br>
              I'm trying to tell you how much I admire<br>
              you... and your pretty wife Tracy.</p>
            <p> Mills freezes, turns to Doe. Doe smiles. Somerset is close.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Throw your weapon, detective! Now!</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (to John Doe)<br>
              What did you say?</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              It's surprising how easily a member of the<br>
              press can purchase information from the men<br>
              in your precinct.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              David... please...</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              I visited your home this morning, after you<br>
              left.</p>
            <p> Mills is filled with an aching terror.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              I tried to play husband... tried to taste<br>
              the life of a simple man, but it didn't<br>
              work out. So, I took a souvenir.</p>
            <p> Mills turns to look at Somerset with pleading eyes. Somerset<br>
              holds out his hand.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Give me the gun.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              Her pretty head.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Somerset...</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              Because I envy your normal life. Envy is<br>
              my sin.</p>
            <p> Somerset can't hold back tears.</p>
            <p> Fury rises in Mill and he turns to level his gun at John Doe.</p>
            <p> Somerset raises his gun and points it at Mills.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              No!</p>
            <p> Mills sees Somerset's gun, raises his gun to Somerset.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Tell me it's not true.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I can't let you do this...</p>
            <p> Mills steps forward, enraged.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Put your gun down!!</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Don't do this... please...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Put the gun down, Somerset!</p>
            <p> A pause. Somerset's gun hand is trembling. The wind whips<br>
              across them. The HELICOPTER can be HEARD distantly. Somerset<br>
              throws his gun down.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              David, listen to me...</p>
            <p> Mills goes to grab John Doe by the throat and puts the gun to<br>
              Doe's forehead, blind with rage.</p>
            <p> Somerset holds his hand behind his back, opens his switchblade.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              He wants this! He wants you to do it!</p>
            <p> Doe is staring into Mills' eyes with wild expectation.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              Kill me.</p>
            <p> Doe lowers his head, waiting for execution.</p>
            <p> Mills holds the gun at Doe's head, undecided, furious.</p>
            <p> Somerset edges towards them.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (looks to Somerset)<br>
              Stop it! You stay away!</p>
            <p> Somerset moves the switchblade so he's holding it by the blade,<br>
              ready to throw, keeping it hidden.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I can't let you do this!</p>
            <p> Mills kicks Doe and throws him backwards on the ground. The<br>
              HELICOPTER is CLOSER.</p>
            <p> Mills stands over Doe and points the gun.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              She begged for her life, and for the life<br>
              of your baby inside her.</p>
            <p> Mills' face fills with confusion -- then a wave of horror.</p>
            <p> Doe's eyes register shock.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              You didn't know.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              NO!</p>
            <p> Somerset brings his hand out to throw the blade, but Mills reacts<br>
              to the movement, turns on Somerset and fires -- BLAM!</p>
            <p> Somerset flies backwards in the air, bullet exploding into his<br>
              shoulder, just above the bullet-proof vest's opening.</p>
            <p> Somerset hits the ground, crying out, bloody, writhing.</p>
            <p> Mills turns the gun on John Doe.</p>
            <p>151 INT. POLICE HELICOPTER -- EARLY EVENING 151</p>
            <p> The chopper is over the marshland. California is leaning out<br>
              with his rifle. He cringes from the sounds as FROM HIS HEADSET<br>
              is HEARD: BLAM -- BLAM -- BLAM -- BLAM -- BLAM.</p>
            <p> INSERT -- TITLE CARD</p>
            <p> TWO WEEKS LATER</p>
            <p>152 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY 152</p>
            <p> Somerset sits in a wheelchair. He is dressed in a hospital gown.<br>
              His upper chest and shoulder are wrapped in bandages. He stares<br>
              out the window at the city's buildings.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN (o.s)<br>
              Hey there, Somerset.</p>
            <p> Somerset turns to see the captain. Somerset looks weak, older.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Hello.</p>
            <p> The captain walks in, carrying something behind his back.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              How you feeling?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess<br>
              I feel great.</p>
            <p> Somerset musters a lame smile. The captain sits on the bed.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              The guys at the precinct heard you're<br>
              getting out today. Anyway, we all chipped<br>
              in...</p>
            <p> The captain takes a big tool belt full of tools from behind his<br>
              back. He hands it over. Somerset looks at it and lays it on his<br>
              lap. He smiles for real.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Thank you. Tell them, thank you.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              We figure you need all the tools you can<br>
              get to fix up that piece of shit you call a<br>
              house.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Yeah, that's true.</p>
            <p> Somerset continues examining the tools.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              They're hoping you stop and say goodbye<br>
              before you go, but I told them not to<br>
              expect it.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (not looking up)<br>
              It would be too hard.</p>
            <p> The captain stands.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              I have to get going, but... there is one<br>
              more thing.</p>
            <p> Somerset looks up. The captain takes a letter from his pocket.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              I don't know if you're going to want it.<br>
              It was down front. It's from Mills.</p>
            <p> Somerset pauses, then puts out his hand to take it.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              He's being arraigned tomorrow.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I read about it in the paper.</p>
            <p> Somerset just looks at the letter.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              I guess... decide for yourself. I don't<br>
              know what it says. I'm going to go.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I'll see you.</p>

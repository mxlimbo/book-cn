              <br>
              118 INT. READY ROOM -- DAY 118</p>
            <p> Somerset and Mills have their shirts open. A female technician<br>
              tapes a small radio transmitter and microphone to Mills' chest.<br>
              Somerset is already wired up, pressing the adhesive to make sure<br>
              it'll hold.</p>
            <p> The technician finishes prepping Mills. Somerset buttons up his<br>
              shirt. The technician packs up her kit, leaving. The room is<br>
              quiet. Somerset picks up his bullet-proof vest, slides into it.</p>
            <p> Mills looks at his watch. He puts on his own vest, fastening it 
              tight. He looks at Somerset.</p>
            <p> Somerset takes out a roll of antacids and pops a few.</p>
            <p> Mills holds out his hand and waits for an antacid. Somerset looks 
              at him, flicks a few into Mills' palm. Mills chews them.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Stay as cold as ice.</p>
            <p> Somerset picks up his gun off a chair. Mills picks up his gun.<br>
              They both check them out and close them up. They lay the guns in<br>
              holsters at the small of their backs.</p>
            <p> They look at each other. Somerset holds out his hand. Mills<br>
              shakes it.</p>
            <p>119 INT. CITY STREET, PRECINCT HOUSE FRONT -- DAY 119</p>
            <p> The street is full of shadows as the sun is falling low. At the<br>
              front of the precinct house, a throng of reporters shifts anxiously. 
              A line of policemen holds them back.</p>
            <p> Martin Talbot steps out of the precinct house, cops on either<br>
              side of him. The press swarm lurches forward, flashbulbs exploding. 
              Talbot holds out his hands, preparing to speak.</p>
            <p>120 EXT. CITY STREET, PRECINCT HOUSE REAR -- DAY 120</p>
            <p> At the rear of the precinct house, Somerset's car pulls out of<br>
              the fenced in parking lot. The car speeds up on the street and<br>
              turns a corner, heading into the grim city.</p>
            <p>121 EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOFTOP -- DAY 121</p>
            <p> California is dressed in full battle gear, looking through binoculars 
              to the city below. The wind blows hard.</p>
            <p> A PILOT, holding two helmets, comes up behind California. A<br>
              sleek police helicopter sits on the roof's helipad.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              Is this wind going to hurt us?</p>
            <p> PILOT<br>
              Just makes the ride more fun.</p>
            <p> The cocky pilot grins.</p>
            <p>122 INT. SOMERSET'S CAR -- DAY 122</p>
            <p> Somerset is at the wheel. Mills is in the passenger's seat,<br>
              looking back at John Doe through protective wire mesh. Doe's in<br>
              the back seat. His handcuffs are attached to ankle cuffs by a<br>
              length of chain. He is dressed in gray pants and a gray shirt,<br>
              looking out the window, sweaty but placid.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Who are you, John? Who are you really?</p>
            <p> John Doe looks to Somerset's eyes in the rearview mirror.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              What do you mean?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little 
              about yourself?</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              (pause)<br>
              It doesn't matter who I am. Who I am means absolutely nothing.<br>
              (looking out, to Somerset)<br>
              You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Where we headed?</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              You'll see.</p>
            <p> Mills looks at Doe for a long time in silence.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny? 
              That wouldn't be... shocking enough. Wouldn't keep you on the front 
              page of the newspapers.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the 
              shoulder. You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer.<br>
              Then, you have their strict attention.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What makes you so special that people should pay attention?</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              Not me. I'm not special. I'm not exceptional.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              This is, though. What I'm doing.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're 
              especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious 
              murders of yours.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              You know that's not true.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened.</p>
            <p> Doe looks down for a moment, then looks up, almost shyly.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet. Not yet. 
              But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Spit it out.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              It's going to be flawless. People will barely be able to comprehend 
              it. It will seem almost surreal... but it will have a tangible reality, 
              so they won't be able to deny it.</p>
            <p> Doe looks down, licking his lips. He clenches his hands into fists, 
              digging his bandaged fingertips into his sweaty palms.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              I can't wait for you to see. I can't<br>
              wait...<br>
              (pause, looks to Mills)<br>
              It's really going to be something.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Well, I'll be standing beside you the<br>
              whole time, so you be sure to let me know<br>
              when this whole, complete reality thing is<br>
              done. Wouldn't want to miss it.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              Oh, don't worry. You won't...</p>
            <p>123 INT, POLICE HELICOPTER -- DAY 123</p>
            <p> The helicopter is in flight above the city. California is<br>
              strapped in, hanging out the door. He holds a high powered<br>
              automatic rifle, wears goggles and a helmet/headset.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE (v.o.)<br>
              (through headset)<br>
              ... you won't miss a thing.</p>
            <p> Two other armed cops sit in the belly of the chopper. California<br>
              leans in and looks up towards the pilot.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              (into helmet microphone)<br>
              Head over the bridge and keep them in sight. Just keep your distance.</p>
            <p> The pilot looks back and nods.</p>
            <p>124 EXT. CITY SKY -- DAY 124</p>
            <p> The chopper dips, flying like a bullet over the polluted city, 
              heading towards the setting sun.</p>
            <p>125 EXT. CITY STREETS -- DAY 125</p>
            <p> Somerset's car moves along a highway at river's edge. Heading<br>
              for a huge suspension bridge filled with speeding traffic ahead.</p>
            <p>126 INT. SOMERSET'S CAR -- DAY 126</p>
            <p> John Doe has his head against the window, looking up at the<br>
              bridge, excited. He sits back, glances out the back window, then<br>
              faces front, bites his lip, fidgety, like a kid on Christmas Eve.</p>
            <p> Somerset's watching him through the rearview mirror.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              What's so exciting?</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              It's not too far away now.</p>
            <p><br>
              [page 106. missing from script]</p>
            <p><br>
              JOHN DOE<br>
              (long pause)<br>
              I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than...<br>
              Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without 
              windows.<br>
              (looks to Mills)<br>
              Isn't that true? How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (coy mocking)<br>
              Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny. I like you. I 
              like you a lot.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              You wouldn't because you know there are consequences. It's in those 
              eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking<br>
              pleasure in his work.<br>
              (pause, shakes his head)<br>
              I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the 
              sinner. I only took their sins to logical conclusions.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your 
              rocks off. That's all.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny?<br>
              Look at the people I killed. An obese man, a disgusting man who 
              could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street,<br>
              you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you. Who if 
              you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to<br>
              finish your meal. After him I picked the lawyer. And, you both must 
              have been secretly thanking me for that one. This was a man who 
              dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he 
              could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Murderers?</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              (ignoring)<br>
              A woman...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Murderers like you?</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              (ignoring, louder)<br>
              A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on 
              living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside. A drug dealer... 
              a drug dealing pederast, actually. <br>
              (laughs at that one)<br>
              And, don't forget the disease spreading whore. Only in a world this 
              shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and 
              keep a straight face.<br>
              (getting worked up)<br>
              That's the point. You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, 
              and in every home, literally. And we tolerate it. Because it's common, 
              it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and 
              night. Not anymore. I'm setting the example, and it's going to be 
              puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Delusions of grandeur.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              You should be thanking me.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              And, why is that?</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me. And, 
              the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              We would have gotten you eventually.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              Really? Just biding your time, then?<br>
              Toying with me. Is that it? Letting five people die until you finally 
              felt like going out and hauling me in?</p>
            <p> Doe sits forward, slowly getting to Mills.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              (angrily)<br>
              Tell me what it was that gave me away.<br>
              What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me 
              right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the<br>
              air.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I seem to remember knocking on your door.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              And, I remember breaking your nose.<br>
              (leans further forward)<br>
              You're only alive because I didn't kill you.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Sit back.</p>
            <p> John Doe doesn't sit back, staying very close to the wire mesh.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              I spared you, and you're going to have to remember that every time 
              you look in the mirror at that nose on your face for the rest of 
              your life. Or, I should say, for the rest of what life I've allowed 
              you to<br>
              have.</p>
            <p> Mills slams his fist against the mesh, fed up, furious.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I said, sit back, freak. Sit back and shut your fucking mouth!</p>
            <p> Die sits back, taking a deep breath and letting it out.</p>
            <p> In the front seat, Somerset shoots a concerned glance at Mills,<br>
              then looks up into the rearview mirror.</p>
            <p> IN THE MIRROR: Doe, calm, gives Somerset a smile.</p>
            <p> Doe then turns his attention back out the passenger window,<br>
              watching the world pass by, his face pressed to the glass.</p>
            <p> Mills sits forward in his seat, letting his anger come down. Doe<br>
              keeps staring out the window. A long pause.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              Don't ask me to pity the people I killed.<br>
              I don't mourn them anymore than I mourn the thousands who died in 
              Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
            <p> Mills almost lets this pass, but can't. Blunted anger:</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You fuck. You really think what you did<br>
              was God's good work?</p>
            <p> Pause. John Doe is pressing his forefinger into the tip of his<br>
              thumb, causing blood to drip from under the bandage.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              The Lord works in mysterious ways.</p>

              12 INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT -- EARLY MORNING 12</p>
            <p> Somerset lies asleep in bed. It is still dark outside. The PHONE 
              beside the inactive metronome RINGS. Somerset awakens suddenly, 
              startled. He looks towards the phone.</p>
            <p>13 INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING 13</p>
            <p> It is just barely becoming light outside. Mills is wide awake 
              in bed beside the sleeping form of his wife, TRACY, 30. Mills looks<br>
              tired. He listens to passing traffic. He covers his eyes with his 
              forearm.</p>
            <p> He takes his arm away and sits up, frustrated, sits on the edge<br>
              of the bed. The room is a shambles, filled with moving boxes.</p>
            <p> Light coming through the window glows upon a football trophy<br>
              sticking from one box.</p>
            <p> Large and noble, a golden player stands in frozen motion at the<br>
              trophy's pinnacle.</p>
            <p> Mills looks at the trophy and a fond smile forms on his face.<br>
              The PHONE RINGS. Mills looks towards it. Tracy awakens. She<br>
              looks up with half-opened eyes, a beautiful woman.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              What is it?</p>
            <p> Phone rings. Mills reaches to touch Tracy's shoulder.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              It's okay.</p>
            <p> Mills leans to get the phone. Tracy seems frightened.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              Honey... where are we?</p>
            <p>14 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, ALLEYWAY -- EARLY MORNING 14</p>
            <p> Somerset and Mills, both wearing badges, walk with OFFICER DAVIS, 
              a beefy, uniformed cop. They pass police cars and head into a trash 
              strewn alleyway. Davis hands Somerset two flashlights.</p>
            <p> DAVIS<br>
              Everything's like I found it. I didn't touch anything.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              What time did you confirm the death?</p>
            <p> DAVIS<br>
              Like I said, I didn't touch him, but he's had his face in a plate 
              of spaghetti for about forty-five minutes now.</p>
            <p> They reach a rusty, side door, which Davis pulls open.</p>
            <p>15 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- EARLY MORNING 15</p>
            <p> They enter a dark, ugly stairwell.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (to Davis) <br>
              Hold on... you mean you didn't check for vital signs?</p>
            <p> DAVIS<br>
              Did I stutter? Believe me, he ain't breathing, unless he's started 
              breathing spaghetti sauce.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              The point is, whenever you find...</p>
            <p> DAVIS<br>
              Begging your pardon, but the guy's sitting in pile of his own shit 
              and piss. If he ain't dead, he would've stood up by now.</p>
            <p> Mills is angry, about to speak, but Somerset heads him off.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (to Davis)<br>
              Thank you, officer. We'll need to talk to you again, after we've 
              looked around.</p>
            <p> DAVIS<br>
              Yes, sir.</p>
            <p> Davis walks out, eyeing Mills. Mills watches him go. The rusty<br>
              door slams shut behind Davis. It's very dark. Somerset turns on<br>
              his flashlight, hands the other to Mills and starts upstairs.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were 
              about to get into?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead 
              man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it 
              in and eating a donut.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Drop it.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              For now.</p>
            <p>16 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- EARLY MORNING 16</p>
            <p> Somerset comes from the stairwell, looking down the dark hall.<br>
              At the end of the hall, a door is open. The light of a CAMERA<br>
              FLASH spills out from that room every few seconds.</p>
            <p> Mills and Somerset move on. Somerset takes out rubber gloves and<br>
              slips them on, looking at something on the floor ahead. A yellow<br>
              RECYCLING BIN sits just outside the door. It contains many neat,<br>
              string-bound stacks of issues of READER'S DIGEST.</p>
            <p>17 INT. APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- EARLY MORNING 17</p>
            <p> There are lights on in this room. Lamps with dusty shades. A<br>
              few porn mags on a table. Somerset and Mills cross. A couch<br>
              against one wall is piled with yellowed, once white pillows. It<br>
              faces two small televisions, both on with no sound.</p>
            <p>18 INT. APARTMENT, KITCHEN -- EARLY MORNING 18</p>
            <p> Somerset and Mills enter, using their flashlights in the dark.<br>
              Mills takes out a handkerchief, covering his nose. ERIC is<br>
              crouched on the floor, putting camera equipment away.</p>
            <p> He's wearing a medical mask over his face. He hoists his bag and<br>
              moves past the detectives.</p>
            <p> ERIC<br>
              Enjoy.</p>
            <p> Eric leaves. Somerset sweeps the room with his flashlight...</p>
            <p> At the stove, each burner has a used pot or pan on it. Food has<br>
              been slopped there and on the adjoining counter-top and sink.<br>
              Used utensils are everywhere, along with empty tin cans and jars.<br>
              Cockroaches swarm.</p>
            <p> The flashlight beam follows a trail of dripped sauces, soups and<br>
              crumbs of food across the floor from the stove to a kitchen<br>
              table. The kitchen table is covered in soiled paper plates which<br>
              hold bits of half-eaten sandwiches, potatoes, beef stew, donuts<br>
              and many other junk foods.</p>
            <p> The kitchen is tiny; barely enough room for three people. The<br>
              kitchen table is at the center of the room. An OBESE MAN is<br>
              slumped forward in a kitchen chair. He is face down dead in a <br>
              plate of spaghetti.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Christ... somebody phone Guiness. I think<br>
              we've got a World's Record here.</p>
            <p> Mills walks to the dead man, leaning to study, without touching.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Who said this was murder?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              No one yet.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Then, why are we wasting our time? This guy's heart's got to be 
              roughly the size of a canned ham. If this isn't a coronary, I don't 
              know what is.</p>
            <p> Somerset moves his flashlight beam down the obese corpse, stops<br>
              at the man's feet. Somerset kneels.</p>
            <p> At the obese man's pants cuff, there's a tiny bit of rope sticking 
              out. Somerset uses a pen to lift the pants leg. Rope is tied around 
              the swollen, purple ankle.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Or not.</p>
            <p> Somerset stands and steps back. Mills bends to take his place,<br>
              looking under the table and shining his flashlight into the corpse's 
              lap. The obese man's bloated hands are folded there, bound tightly 
              with rope.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Still... he could have tied himself up, to make it look like murder. 
              I saw a guy once... committed suicide, but wanted to make sure his 
              family could collect the life insurance, right?</p>
            <p> Somerset does not listen. He is focused on the corpse, studies<br>
              the back of the man's head and neck. He runs his pen against the<br>
              back of the corpse's neck, combing the hair upwards.</p>
            <p> There are small circular and semi-circular BRUISES on the back 
              of<br>
              the obese man's head and neck, some hidden under the hair.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, 
              so what else could it be but homicide? Except, I finally figured<br>
              out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his 
              own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body 
              backwards...</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (irritated)<br>
              Please be quiet for a while, would you?</p>
            <p> Mills looks up at Somerset from below. Somerset remains focused<br>
              on the bruises.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (sarcastic)<br>
              Oh, yes, sir. Forgive me.</p>
            <p> Mills stands and walks around to the other side of the table, 
              where he gets down again.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              There's a bucket here.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              There's a bucket. Under the table.</p>
            <p> Somerset crouches, pulls up the cheap tablecloth on his side of<br>
              the table. A METAL BUCKET sits under the table.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              What is it?</p>
            <p> Mills slides under with his flashlight, angling in the confined 
              space to look. He is repulsed and pulls back.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              It's vomit.</p>
            <p> Mills stands and backs away, near the refrigerator, not wanting 
              to be anywhere near that bucket.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              It's a bucket of vomit.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Is there any blood in it?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I don't know. Feel free to look for yourself, okay?</p>
            <p> Somerset stands, stares at the obese man. He shakes his head,<br>
              perplexed. There is a KNOCK at the door. The detectives look to<br>
              see DOCTOR THOMAS O'NEILL, 52, the medical examiner, in the<br>
              doorway. O'Neill is looking at the ceiling. He flicks the lighs 
              switch. No light, so he flicks the switch up and down.</p>
            <p> O'NEILL<br>
              Wonderful.</p>
            <p> O'Neill seems a bit gone. He drops his black bag onto the floor<br>
              beside the corpse. he begins to sort through the bag, surgical tools 
              clinking together.</p>
            <p> Mills turns to open the refrigerator. It's nearly empty.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (to Somerset)<br>
              You think it was poison?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Guessing at this point is useless.</p>
            <p> The trash can beside the refrigerator is filled to the brim with 
              empty food containers. Mills begins to poke around with a pen.</p>
            <p> O'NEILL<br>
              You girls have got forensics waiting outside. I don't know if we'll 
              all fit though.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              There's room. Light's the problem.</p>
            <p> Somerset looks at Mills, then at the space limitations.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Still... two is company here. And, three is certainly a crowd.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              Detective Mills, go help the officers question the neighbors.</p>
            <p> Mills looks up, not pleased.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I'd rather stay on this.</p>
            <p> Somerset is looking at the corpse.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Send one of the forensics in on your way out.</p>
            <p> Mills does not move. He lifts his flashlight to shine the light 
              on the side of Somerset's face. A moment. Somerset looks at Mills, 
              the light shining directly in Somerset's eyes. A longer moment. 
              Mills switches off the light and leaves.</p>
            <p> O'Neill places both hands on the dead man's head and lifts the<br>
              swollen visage from the spaghetti.</p>
            <p> O'NEILL<br>
              He is dead.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Thank you, Doctor.</p>
            <p>19 INT. SOMERSET'S CAR -- DAY 19</p>
            <p> Somerset drives with Mills as the passenger. Heavy city traffic.<br>
              Both stare ahead in silence. Mills is a bundle of nerves.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You've seen my files, right? Seen the things I've done?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (looking out window)<br>
              Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat. I 
              did all that shit for a long time.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Good.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              The badge in my pocket says &quot;detective,&quot; same as yours.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the 
              scene. I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time 
              on the playing field.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Yeah, well, all I want is...<br>
              (pause)<br>
              Just, just don't be jerking me off. That's all I ask. Don't jerk 
              me off.</p>
            <p> Mills looks at Somerset. Somerset keeps his eyes on the road,<br>
              but nods slightly. That said, Mills slumps low into his seat.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              We'll be spending every waking hour together till I leave. I'll 
              show you who your friends are, and your enemies. I'll help you cut 
              through the red tape and I will help you &quot;integrate,&quot; 
              as the captain puts it. However...<br>
              (pauses, clears throat)<br>
              No matter how much you beg or plead... <br>
              jerking off is something you'll have to do for yourself.</p>
            <p> This throws Mills. Somerset has a sense of humour?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Is that clear?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Okay... sure... It's just that, with my old partner, you know...</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship. We'd 
              start quarreling over insignificant things.</p>
            <p> Mills lets out a nervous laugh, feels a bit of weight off his 
              shoulders.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Whatever you say, Detective. Beautiful.</p>

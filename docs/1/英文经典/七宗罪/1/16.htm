              114 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, OBSERVATION ROOM -- DAY 114</p>
            <p> Mills holds a fingerprint card. The black ink prints are just<br>
              useless blobs, smeared with blood.</p>
            <p> Mills, Somerset and the Captain stand in darkness. Mills looks<br>
              up from the print card through a two-way mirror into an interrogation 
              room.</p>
            <p> In the interrogation room, John Doe sits, handcuffed to the wall.<br>
              This is not some superhuman serial killer.</p>
            <p> He looks more like an eccentric college professor, not seething<br>
              with anger, but looking around with calm, almost lazy eyes. The<br>
              lawyer, MARK SWARR, sits taking notes and talking with Doe.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              He cuts off the skin if his fingertips.<br>
              That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment. 
              He's been doing it for quite a while. Keeps cutting before the papillary 
              line can grow back.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What about the trace on his bank account and the guns? There must 
              be something to connect him with a past.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              So far it's all dead ends. No credit history. No employment history. 
              His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash. We're 
              even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's 
              independently wealth, well educated and totally insane. We may never<br>
              know how he got that way.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Because he is John Doe, by choice.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              When do we get to question him?</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              You don't. It goes to court now.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              He wouldn't just turn himself in. It doesn't make any sense.</p>
            <p> Somerset moves from the window, crossing the room to sit.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Well, there he sits. It's not supposed to make sense.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              He's not finished.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              You're wound too tight, Mills. Let it go.</p>
            <p> The captain walks. Mills is furious. He presses his fingers<br>
              against the two-way-mirror, pushes to crack his knuckles loudly.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (to Somerset)<br>
              You know he's fucking us.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement. 
              He wouldn't just stop.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Well... what the fuck, man?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right? 
              Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next? I mean, can 
              you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?</p>
            <p> Mills looks in at John Doe. Somerset comes to stand beside.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I can tell you this. I recognize his lawyer. His name's Mark Swarr.</p>
            <p> Mills looks at Somerset.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              He's the one who got Victor out.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              We'll wait for John Doe's plea.</p>
            <p>115 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- DAY 115</p>
            <p> Mills is at the desk, feet up. He stares at the blackboard.</p>
            <p> 1 gluttony (x) 5 wrath<br>
              2 greed (x) 6 pride (x)<br>
              3 sloth (x) 7 lust (x)<br>
              4 envy</p>
            <p> Clock on the wall says 4:45. Somerset is packing books into<br>
              boxes, preparing for his eventual departure.</p>
            <p> The captain steps into the office and clears his throat, looking<br>
              like there is something making him very unhappy.</p>
            <p>116 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- DAY 116</p>
            <p> Mills and Somerset stand together. The captain is behind his<br>
              desk with Martin Talbot, the D.A., seated in front of him. Mark<br>
              Swarr is addressing them all, seems nervous but in control.</p>
            <p> SWARR<br>
              My client says there are two more bodies...<br>
              two more victims, hidden away. He will take Detectives Mills and 
              Somerset to these bodies, but only Detectives Mills and Somerset. 
              Only at six o'clock today.</p>
            <p> Talbot wipes his moist brow with a handkerchief.</p>
            <p> TALBOT<br>
              Oh, Christ.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Why us?</p>
            <p> SWARR<br>
              He says he admires you.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (to captain)<br>
              My client claims that if the detectives do not accept this offer, 
              these two bodies will never be found.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Frankly, counselor, I'm inclined to let them rot.</p>
            <p> TALBOT<br>
              We don't make deals, Mr. Swarr.</p>
            <p> Mills gets in Swarr's face.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              How is it working for a scumbag like this?<br>
              You proud of yourself?</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Ease back, Mills.</p>
            <p> SWARR<br>
              I'm required by law to serve my clients to the best of my ability, 
              and to serve their best interests.</p>
            <p> Mills back off.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Well, we're going to have to pass.</p>
            <p> SWARR<br>
              My client... he also wishes to inform you, if you do not accept, 
              he will plead insanity, across the board.</p>
            <p> TALBOT<br>
              (to no one in particular)<br>
              Let him try! I'd like to see him try!</p>
            <p> SWARR<br>
              Come now, Martin. We all know, with the extreme nature of these 
              crimes, I could get him off with such a plea.</p>
            <p> Talbot considers this, wringing the handkerchief in his hands.<br>
              Mills looks at Somerset. Somerset looks at him.</p>
            <p> TALBOT<br>
              I'm not letting this conviction slide, I can tell you that right 
              here and right now!</p>
            <p> SWARR<br>
              He says, if you accept, under his specific conditions, he will sign 
              a full confession and plead guilty... right here, right now.</p>
            <p> Talbot glares at Swarr.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              (to Mills)<br>
              What do you think?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I'm in.</p>
            <p> SWARR<br>
              It has to be both of you.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              If he were to claim insanity, this conversation is admissible. The 
              fact that he's blackmailing us with his plea...</p>
            <p> SWARR<br>
              And, my client reminds you, two more are dead. The press would have 
              a field day if they found out the police didn't seem too<br>
              concerned about finding them... giving them a proper burial.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              If there REALLY ARE two more dead.</p>
            <p> The captain picks up a sheet from his desk.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              The lab report came up from downtown, They did a quickie on Doe's 
              clothing and fingernails. They found blood from Doe,<br>
              from him cutting his own fingers... there was blood from the woman 
              whose face he cut off, and blood from a third party. As yet unidentified.</p>
            <p> TALBOT<br>
              (to Somerset)<br>
              You would be escorting an unarmed man.</p>
            <p> Somerset thinks it over. He looks to Mills.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Let's finish it.</p>
            <p> Somerset looks at the floor, then at Swarr.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (to the captain)<br>
              Well... get the fucking lawyer out of the room and we can talk about 
              how this whole thing's going to go down.</p>
            <p>117 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, BATHROOM/LOCKER ROOM -- DAY 117</p>
            <p> Somerset's hand reaches to the sink to pick up a razor.</p>
            <p> Somerset and Mills are at the sinks, looking at themselves in<br>
              mirrors, shirtless. They have shaving cream spread across their<br>
              chests. Somerset flicks his cigarette in the sink, then brings<br>
              the razor up to start shaving the hair off his chest. Mills is<br>
              already doing the same.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O.<br>
              flies out, I want you to have expected it.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I will.</p>
            <p> They continue shaving.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              If I were to accidentally cut off one of my nipple, would that be 
              covered by workman's compensation?</p>
            <p> Somerset smiles just slightly.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I suppose so.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              If you were man enough to actually file the claim, I'd buy you a 
              new one out of my own pocket.</p>
            <p> Mills finishes shaving, washes and wipes his chest off with a 
              towel. He turns dead serious.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Listen, Somerset... I uh...</p>
            <p> Mills pauses, sighs. Somerset stops shaving and looks at him.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              What is it?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Well, I have to tell you...<br>
              (pause)<br>
              I think I've fallen in love with you.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (shakes his head)<br>
              Slut.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (laughs, walking out)<br>
              Kiss me on the lips.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (still shaving)<br>
              Give me a break.</p>

              <br>
              127 EXT. SKY -- EARLY EVENING 127</p>
            <p> The helicoper flies over huge, blackened industrial parks, past<br>
              smokestacks spewing soot. The sky is turning crimson.</p>
            <p>128 INT. POLICE HELICOPTER -- EARLY EVENING 128</p>
            <p> California leans way out looking back at the city.</p>
            <p>129 EXT. INDUSTRIAL ROAD -- EARLY EVENING 129</p>
            <p> Somerset's car comes down this rocky, deserted strip, towards 
              the<br>
              industrial parks. The car tosses dirt into the air where it is<br>
              captured on the wind.</p>
            <p>130 EXT. SKY -- EARLY EVENING 130</p>
            <p> The chopper roars, low, close to the stretch of industrial road.<br>
              This is the only road through vast swampy fields. The industrial<br>
              parks are far behind.</p>
            <p>131 INT. POLICE HELICOPTER -- EARLY EVENING 131</p>
            <p> California still leans out, gun poised, looks over the fields.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              There ain't no ambush out here. There ain't no fucking nothing out 
              here.</p>
            <p> PILOT (v.o.)<br>
              (through headset)<br>
              We got about two minutes before they come up behind us.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              Go high. Way up. In sixty seconds, cut to the west.</p>
            <p>132 EXT. SKY -- EARLY EVENING 132</p>
            <p> The chopper climbs, really moving.</p>
            <p>133 EXT. INDUSTRIAL ROAD -- EARLY EVENING 133</p>
            <p> Somerset's car comes down the road, surrounded by marshlands.</p>
            <p> The car slows, then stops. Mills gets out and goes to extract<br>
              Doe. Somerset gets out, looking east to the industrial parks and<br>
              city beyond. The sky is darkening.</p>
            <p> Somerset walks and looks to the west. The sky is red. Very far<br>
              away, a passenger train moves towards the hidden sun.</p>
            <p> Somerset watches the train, walking to the edge of the roadway.<br>
              He looks down and steps back from what he sees.</p>
            <p> A dead dog lies in the weeds, old and moldering.</p>
            <p> Somerset turns to the car, where John Doe stands with Mills. Doe<br>
              points with his cuffed hands to the dog, grins.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              I didn't do that.</p>
            <p>134 EXT. MARSHLANDS -- EARLY EVENING 134</p>
            <p> The wind howls, pounding on John Doe as he walks through the<br>
              swampy field. He walks slowly, encumbered by the deep muck and<br>
              by the short chain between his ankles. Mills is with Doe,<br>
              disgusted by the ooze covering his shoes and pants cuffs. He<br>
              looks ahead, cautious. Somerset walks behind them.</p>
            <p> Doe keeps looking back towards the car on the industrial road.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What are you looking for?</p>
            <p> Doe looks forward.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              What time is it?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Why?</p>
            <p> Somerset looks at his watch. It's one minutes after seven.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              I want to know.</p>
            <p> Mills gives Doe a shove.</p>
            <p> Somerset looks back towards the industrial road, worried.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Just keep leading the way.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              It's close.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Mills!</p>
            <p> Mills and Doe look back at Somerset. Somerset is facing the<br>
              industrial road, pointing. A van is coming, dust flying.</p>
            <p> Somerset looks at Mills. Mills looks at Somerset. They take out<br>
              their guns. Somerset starts towards the road.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Stay with him.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Wait!</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              There's no time to discuss it!</p>
            <p> Somerset runs to head off the van.</p>
            <p> John Doe begins walking to follow Somerset.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              There he goes.</p>
            <p> Mills levels his gun at John Doe's head.</p>
            <p>135 EXT. MARSHLANDS, NEAR INDUSTRIAL ROAD -- EARLY EVENING 135</p>
            <p> Somerset runs, breathing hard, opening the top of his<br>
              bullet-proof vest to speak into his hidden microphone.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              There's a van... coming down the industrial<br>
              road. Coming from the east.</p>
            <p>136 INT. POLICE HELICOPTER -- EARLY EVENING 136</p>
            <p> The chopper is circling in the air, far from the marshlands with<br>
              the sun behind it. Another cop is in the hatchway beside<br>
              California, looking through binoculars.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET (v.o.)<br>
              (from headset)<br>
              The van is coming form the east. I don't<br>
              know what it is. Come around. Come<br>
              around.</p>
            <p>137 EXT. MARSHLANDS, NEAR INDUSTRIAL ROAD -- EARLY EVENING 137</p>
            <p> Somerset continues, charging through the mire.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Just get ready for anything and wait for my signal. Wait for me.</p>
            <p>138 EXT. MARSHLANDS -- EARLY EVENING 138</p>
            <p> Mills keeps the gun on John Doe, watches Somerset far off.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              It's good we have some time to talk.</p>
            <p> Doe starts walking again.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Get down. Get down on your knees!</p>
            <p> Mills grabs Doe and pushes Doe's knees out with his foot, making<br>
              Doe kneel in the brown water.</p>
            <p> Mills positions himself behind Doe so that Doe is between him 
              and<br>
              the road. Now, Mills can keep the gun on Mills and still watch<br>
              Somerset.</p>
            <p>139 EXT. MARSHLANDS, INDUSTRIAL ROAD -- EARLY EVENING 139</p>
            <p> Somerset comes up on the road, near his car. He signals for the<br>
              van to stop, then fires a warning shot in the air. The van is<br>
              about one hundred yards away, still coming.</p>
            <p> Somerset walks towards it, breathless, pointing his gun.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Stop the van! Stop!</p>
            <p> The van brakes, wheels sliding on the loose roadway. Stops.<br>
              Somerset moves up to it, staying about ten feet away.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Get out! Get out with your hands on your<br>
              head! Do it now!</p>
            <p> The driver of the van, a DELIVERYMAN, pushes the door open and<br>
              slides out, slow, takes off his sunglasses.</p>
            <p> DELIVERYMAN<br>
              Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Turn around. Hands on your head!</p>
            <p> DELIVERYMAN<br>
              What the hell's going on?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Who are you? What are you doing out here?</p>
            <p> DELIVERYMAN<br>
              I'm... I'm just delivering a package.</p>
            <p>140 INT. POLICE HELICOPTER -- EARLY EVENING 140</p>
            <p> California listens as the chopper spins over industrial parks.</p>
            <p> DELIVERYMAN (v.o.)<br>
              (through headset)<br>
              It's just a package for this guy... David.<br>
              Detective David Mills.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              Motherfucker.</p>
            <p> The pilot looks back at California.</p>
            <p> PILOT<br>
              Let's do it.</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              No! Wait for Somerset!</p>
            <p>141 EXT. MARSHLANDS -- EARLY EVENING 141</p>
            <p> Mills and Doe can see Somerset keeping his distance from the<br>
              deliveryman. The deliveryman moves to the back of the van and<br>
              opens the van's rear door.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              When I said I admired you... I meant what I said. I do admire you.</p>
            <p> Mills keeps his eyes on the van, but steps up to place his gun 
              at<br>
              the back of Doe's head. Pulls the hammer back.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Shut up.</p>
            <p>142 EXT. MARSHLANDS, INDUSTRIAL ROAD -- EARLY EVENING 142</p>
            <p> The deliveryman takes a brown package, about a foot square, from<br>
              the van.</p>
            <p> DELIVERYMAN<br>
              This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here. He wanted 
              it here at exactly seven o'clock.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Put it down. Put it on the ground.</p>
            <p> DELIVERYMAN<br>
              Okay...</p>
            <p> He puts it on the road and backs away, holding up his hands.</p>
            <p> Somerset glances into the field to see Doe on his knees with<br>
              Mills behins him. Somerset looks at the package. Written on<br>
              top: DETECTIVE DAVID MILLS -- HANDLE WITH CARE.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (to deliveryman)<br>
              Go. Get out of here!</p>
            <p> The deliveryman backs off, then scrambles into the van. Somerset<br>
              pulls back his bullet-proof vest and speaks into the mic.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              There's a package here. It's from John Doe.</p>
            <p> The van tears away. Somerset doesn't know what to do. He walks<br>
              around the package, reholsters his gun.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I don't know... I don't know...</p>
            <p> He looks out towards Doe and Mills.</p>
            <p>143 INT. HELICOPTER -- EARLY EVENING 143</p>
            <p> California waits, listening, looking into the blood-red sky.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET (.o.)<br>
              (through headset)<br>
              I'm going to have to open it.</p>
            <p>144 EXT. MARSHLANDS -- EARLY EVENING 144</p>
            <p> Mills watches Somerset kneel beside the package on the road.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              I wish I could have been a normal man like you. I wish I could have 
              a simple life.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What the fuck is going on here?!</p>
            <p>145 EXT. MARSHLANDS, INDUSTRIAL ROAD -- EARLY EVENING 145</p>
            <p> Somerset pulls his switchblade, clicks it open.</p>
            <p> He cuts across the top of the box, hands shaking, cuts quickly.<br>
              He pulls the box open, pulls at some bubble-wrap inside.</p>
            <p>146 INT. POLICE HELICOPTER -- EARLY EVENING 146</p>
            <p> The pilot grits his teeth.</p>
            <p> PILOT<br>
              (into helmet mic)<br>
              Let's go!</p>
            <p> CALIFORNIA<br>
              We are going to wait!</p>
            <p> California listens.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET (v.o.)<br>
              (through headset)<br>
              Oh, Christ... oh Christ...</p>

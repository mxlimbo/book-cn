              <p>I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER </p>
              <p>PART 9 </p>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p>Man - <br>
              You in some kind of trouble child? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yes, yeah I'm in a lot of trouble. </p>
            <p>The man flips a silver medallion that says &quot;I Love You&quot;. 
            </p>
            <p>Man - <br>
              That's a shame, being it's forth of july and all. Kids like you 
              should be out having fun, drinking, partying, running people over, 
              getting away with murder, things like that. </p>
            <p>A shocked look comes over Julies face, what is going on? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              You? Ben Willis? </p>
            <p>Man - <br>
              Good, I see you've been doing your homework too. </p>
            <p>She runs out the door looking for somewhere to go. He follows her 
              back and forth playing cat and mouse. Ray has gotten up, he is looking 
              at the boat that has started drifting from shore. Julie finds a 
              gun used to signal for help in case of emergancy, he is steering 
              the boat now and jives it sending the signal gun over the edge. 
              They have a state-down then he comes after her. She crawls down 
              a cubbyhole below deck that is covered by a mesh grate, she pulls 
              down on it from below as he is trying to pull it open with his hook. 
              Ray is now climbing over the side of the boat and comes face to 
              face with Ben. </p>
            <p>Ben - <br>
              Welcome aboard Ray. </p>
            <p>He moves his hook through the air tauntint Ray with it then starts 
              swinging it at him. Julie is below deck still looking for a way 
              to get out, she clibs up a ladder and sees Ben and Ray fighting, 
              she screams to Ray, he turns his head and Ben hits him with his 
              hook which sends him flying off the voat into the water, he is dragging 
              along underwater holding onto a net. Julie runs down below again, 
              Ben is following her, she shuts the door and blocks it with a oil 
              drum. </p>
            <p>Ben - <br>
              Open the door Julie. You got no place to hide </p>
            <p>She is looking for somewhere to go, she opens up a shut door, it 
              is hard to open so she uses her shirt, she gets it open and ice 
              spills out, she crawls in and starts pushing more ice down so Ben 
              can't get in. She breaks apart a crate filled with ice, the body 
              of Helen comes falling down with the ice, Julie screams and moves 
              over and feels something, she moves her hand and Barrys frozen face 
              and underneath of it, she screams again. Ray has made his way back 
              onto the boat. Ben opens a trap door and he is looking down at Julie 
              who screams in terror. Ray is watching what Ben does, waiting for 
              the right moment to pounce. <br>
              Ray then swings down a big hook attached to a rope which hits Ben 
              in the face throwing him to the ground. Ray runs over and looks 
              down at Julie. Julie screams expecting it to be Ben. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Come on Julie. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Ray. </p>
            <p>He sticks his hand out and pulls her out of the ice pit. Ben jumps 
              up, Julie screams, Ben knocks Ray to the ground. </p>
            <p>Ben - <br>
              Happy fourth of july Julie. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Please, it was an accident. </p>
            <p>Ben - <br>
              I know all about accidents and let me give you some advice, when 
              you leave a man for dead, make sure he's really dead. </p>
            <p>He then sticks his hand up in the air which is holding the hook, 
              he is ready to slash Julie with it when all of the sudden his hand 
              gets caught in a rope, Ray sees this and hits something which pulls 
              Ben up into the air and hand gets chopped off in the pully, he falls 
              halfway down again and the rope catches which then sends him flying 
              off into the cold ocean. </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - Wharf --- Julie and Ray and a bunch of police and doctors 
              are around. Ray and Julie are hugging. The ordeal is over. </p>
            <p><br>
              Julie - <br>
              We never killed anyone, this whole year was fake. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              I know. The guilt was killing me, I had to know who he was, that's 
              why I went to see Missy. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but I wanted 
              you back, I couldn't lose you again. I love you Julie. No one gets 
              me the way you do. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I understand your pain. </p>
            <p>The sheriff walks over. </p>
            <p>Shreiff - <br>
              Do you have any idea why this man would want you dead? </p>
            <p>Julie and Ray - <br>
              None. </p>
            <p>They have dragged the ocean and are pulling up what they have found. 
            </p>
            <p>Operator - <br>
              Here it comes. </p>
            <p>All that is in the net is Bens hand with the hook still in it. 
            </p>
            <p>Sheriff - <br>
              Ah don't worry, the body will turn up, they usually do. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>ONE YEAR LATER</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - Julies College --- People are walking around outside. </p>
            <p><br>
              INT. - Womens locker room --- Julie is on the phone with Ray. </p>
            <p><br>
              Julie - <br>
              Yeah well I made the deans list. Thank you very much. I know I miss 
              you too but I'm going to see you in a couple weeks, god I can not 
              wait, I love New York. No of course I love you more....Yes I do, 
              I love you and you know that but you know what? I've got to take 
              a shower or I'm gonna be late. </p>
            <p>Julies roommate Deb is outside the showers. </p>
            <p>Deb - <br>
              Hey Julie you got some mail. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Oh thanks Deb. </p>
            <p>Back to the phone </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              ...A towel. Ray don't you start with me, you mister can ravage me 
              in two weeks. Yes I love you too. Okay bye. </p>
            <p>She hangs up the phone and goes out to get her mail, a look of 
              terror crosses her face, a plain envelope with her name written 
              on it in bold letters. She looks around then opens the letter that 
              says &quot;KBR POOL PARTY&quot; She smiles and goes back to the 
              showers, walking through the steam she sees written on the shower 
              door &quot;I STILL KNOW&quot;. She looks around and sees nothing, 
              she turns back to the shower door and something black jumps out 
              at her. </p>

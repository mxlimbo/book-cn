            <p><br>
              EXT. Reapers curve --- Driving along the highway, driving very dangerously. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. SouthPort beach --- The four friends are on the beach. </p>
            <p><br>
              Ray - <br>
              So the boy and girl are making out right? When they hear over the 
              radio that this lunatic killer's escaped from an insane asylum, 
              he gots this long sharp hook for a hand. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              No, you're telling it wrong. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Shut Up! So the girl, she gets all scared right? And the boy, all 
              hot and bothered, he gets pissed and peels out. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              No, no, no no. That's not the way it goes, okay the boy goes for 
              help and the girl stays in the car and she hears this scratching 
              sound... </p>
            <p>Helen (interupting) - <br>
              It's not a scratching sound, it's a drip, drip, drip. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              No. its scartching because the guys been hung from a tree limb and 
              his feet are scratching on the roof of the car. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              No, he's been decapitated and it's the blood for his severed neck 
              that's dripping on the car going drip, drip, drip. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              No he wasn't decapitated, he was gutted with a hook. That's the 
              way I heard it. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              You're all wrong, they get back to the girls house and find the 
              lunatics bloody hook in the car door. Now that's the original story, 
              that's the way it really happened. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Hey, hey none of it really happened, it's a bullshit ghost story 
              to begin with . </p>
            <p><br>
              Ray - <br>
              No it's not, it's true. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Yeah I don't think so Ray </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              I swear it. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Please, it's a fictional story created to warn young girls of the 
              dangers of having premarital sex. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Well actually honey, you know how terrified I am of your IQ but 
              it's an urban legend, american folklore and they all usually originate 
              from some real life incident. </p>
            <p>Ray smiles. </p>
            <p>Some time has passed on the beach and Helen is running around while 
              Barry is laying on the ground. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              So by that time, I will just be finishing my two year contract on 
              Guiding Light, coinciding with your first year as starting quaterback 
              for the steelers... </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Cowboys! </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Whatever. Then we can elope in Europe or the Caymans or wherever 
              where I will let you impregnate me with the first of thrre children, 
              before you head off to rehab and then we can live hapily... </p>
            <p>Another part of the beach. Julie is walking alone on the beach 
              calling out for Ray. </p>
            <p>Ray (running behind her) - <br>
              I'm gonna hook you!! </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Hey Ray you don't really believe all that crap do you? </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              That's true. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Please, it's really a phallic symbol. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Oh really? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah ultimatly castrated. God I'm gonna miss you. </p>
            <p>They sit down on the sand. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              You don't have to, you can always ditch this Boston thing and come 
              to New York with me. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah well we can't all sit in the village coffee house and ramble 
              esoterically on our laptops. There just isn't enough room. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              See, no one gets me the way you do. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I understand your pain </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Precisely. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I hate this. I really hate this. You're gonna go off and fall for 
              some head shaving-black wearing-tattoo covered-body peircing philosophy 
              student. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              That sounds attractive. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              And I'll never see you again. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Hey, did you know the success rate of high school sweetheart realationships 
              is higher than any other type of relationship? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah? Name your source. </p>
            <p>Ray then puts his hand on his heart. Julie begins to remove her 
              jacket. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Are you sure? </p>
            <p>Julie nods yes. Music comes up and the two begin to kiss as they 
              lay on the ground. </p>
            <p>Cut to - Helen and Barry at Barry's car. Barry wan't the keys to

            <p>Helen then grabs the keys from Barry. </p>

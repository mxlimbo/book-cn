            <p>EXT. - Barrys lawn --- Helen and Julie are walking towards the 
              house. </p>
            <p><br>
              Helen - <br>
              Do you ever see Barry at school? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              It's a big campus. Are you sure he came back? </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Saw his car the other day at the gym. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Did you guys break up? </p>
            <p>Barry walks out on to the patio not pleased at seeing the two of 
              them again. </p>
            <p>Barry (not excited to see them)- <br>
              Hey. What are you two doing here? </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Hi Bare. </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - Barrys patio --- they are discussing the letter. </p>
            <p><br>
              Barry - <br>
              This is nothing. I know what you did last summer? Oooh, what a crock 
              of shit. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              We need help. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Yeah I'll say, you know what? You guys should check out a mirror 
              once and a while, you two look like shit run over twice. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              You're a prick. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              We can't just ignore it. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Come one Julie, how do you know this is even related? You did a 
              lot of things last summer. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah well only one murder comes to mind. </p>
            <p>Barry is extremly pissed that she mentions that night again. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              You shut the hell up! We didn't murder anyone. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              He was still alive when we dumped him in the water. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Do we have to rehash this? It was an accident, the guy was in the 
              middle of the road. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              His name was David Egan. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Who? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              David Egan. He was found three weeks after we.... his body was caught 
              in a shrimp net not far from millers dock. It was in the paper, 
              I think the police called it an accidental drowning. You can call 
              it an accident all you want but he died because of us that's certain. 
            </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              What about Ray? Have you showed this letter to him? What does he 
              think? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I haven't seen Ray since last summer, we broke up and last I heard 
              he was working up north. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Okay let's supposed someone was there that night, why send the letter 
              one year later? Probably some crack fucking around....Max. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Max? You think? </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Who else? He was there. </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - Fish Plant --- Julie, Helen and Barry are walking towards 
              the building. </p>
            <p><br>
              Barry - <br>
              You two wait here. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              What are you gonna do? </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              I know what I'm doing. </p>
            <p><br>
              INT. - Fish Plant --- Max is working with some lobster pots. He 
              notices Barry walking in. </p>
            <p><br>
              Max - <br>
              Well go figure, I was just thinking to myself what ever happened 
              to that Barry Cox? </p>
            <p>Barry (being very polite) - <br>
              Hey Max. Hey listen can we talk for a sec? In private? </p>
            <p>Max - <br>
              Oh what this isn't private enough for you? </p>
            <p>Barry smirks and walks out back and Max follows him. </p>
            <p>Max - <br>
              Yeah what? </p>
            <p>Barry then grabs Max and pushes him into a block of ice holding 
              him down. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Look you shit we got your little letter. </p>
            <p>Max - <br>
              What the hell are you talking about? </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Don't fuck with me Max, you saw us that night. </p>
            <p>Max - <br>
              What the fuck are you on huh? </p>
            <p>Barry grabs a large fish hook that was sitting on a block of ice 
              and holds it up to Maxs face. </p>
            <p>Max - <br>
              Jesus Christ. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Listen I'm gonna say this once, I'll fucking kill your ass, I got 
              no problem with that... </p>
            <p>Max - <br>
              Oh get the fuck off me. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              You understand me? </p>
            <p>Max - <br>
              Get off of me. </p>
            <p>Max struggles with Barry and Barry cuts Max's arm with the hook 
              and then walks away putting the hook back where he got it from. 
              Max is laying on the floor wondering what just happened. He gets 
              up and he is angry and grabs the hook yelling at Barry who is leaving. 
            </p>
            <p>Max - <br>
              Mother fucker. Don't you test me mother fucker, I'll call the cops 
              on your college quaterback ass. </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - Back on the street --- Barry is walking out where Julie and 
              Helen have been waiting. </p>
            <p><br>
              Julie - <br>
              So did he admit to the letter? </p>
            <p>Barry keeps walking. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              He won't bother you anymore. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              What did you do? </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              I took care of it okay? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              How? </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              I scared the shit out of him alright? </p>
            <p>Stepping up from out of a boat is Ray. The old group of friends 
              are reunited. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Well I'll be damned. </p>
            <p>Ray (to Julie) - <br>
              Hi. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              So Ray grew up to be a fisherman huh? </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Yeah, almost a year now, I work on that one over there on the end. 
            </p>
            <p>Barry does not look where Ray has just pointed. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              That's nice. Have a nice life guys, I'm out of here. </p>
            <p>Barry leaves. </p>
            <p>Ray (to Julie) - <br>
              You got a minute? </p>
            <p>Helen doesn't want to be intrude. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              I gotta get back to work, call me, we can get togeather. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah okay. </p>
            <p>Helen leaves Ray and Julie alone to talk. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              We need to talk. </p>
            <p><br>
              INT. - Fish Plant --- Ray and Julie are walking in discussing the 
              letter. </p>
            <p><br>
              Ray - <br>
              You think Max sent it? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Barry does. I don't know. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Well, you know how Max feels about you guys, look he's probably 
              just screwing around, he doesn't have much else to do you know? 
            </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah maybe. </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - On the wharf --- Ray and Julie are talking while he is working. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              Ray - <br>
              So, how's school? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              So you're a fisherman? </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Yeah prophecy fullfilled right? I've become my father. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I thought you didn't know your dad? </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Ah he worked the boats, that's all I do know about him. </p>
            <p>Pause. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Look I thought a lot about last summer, I know you hold me responsible 
              for what happened. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I don't hold you responsible, no I'm responsible for my own actions 
              and I don't blame you. But I don't want to know you either. </p>
            <p>She runs away from a confused Ray leaving him there all alone. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              INT. - Fish Plant - Max is cooking lobsters. he burns his finger 
              and goes to get gloves. He sees a shadow through the steam from 
              the boiling water and looks closer to see what it is and sees someone 
              in a black slicker coming towards him and then the hook goes through 
              his throat and dragging him across the table. </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT - SouthPort street --- Barry is pulling up to the South Port 
              Muscle. </p>
            <p><br>
              INT. - Southport Muscle. --- Barry is working out, punching and 
              kickboxing. </p>
            <p><br>
              INT. - Locker Room --- Barry is taking tape off his hands and sees 
              a shadow. </p>
            <p><br>
              Barry - <br>
              Hello?? </p>
            <p>INT. - Shower --- Barry is showering after his workout, he sees 
              a shadow go past the door. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Hello??? </p>
            <p>INT. - Locker Room --- Barry sees a ploaroid picture sticking out 
              of his locker, he looks at it, it's a picture of his car which is 
              parked outside with &quot;I Know&quot; written on the picture. He 
              looks in his locked and his jacket is missing. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              My fucking jacket. </p>
            <p>He quickly gets dressed and runs out into the lobby where an old 
              man working is reading the newspaper. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Who else is here? anybody else working out? </p>
            <p>Worker - <br>
              Just you and me pal. </p>
            <p>Barry runs outdoor to see his car is being backed out of the parking 
              lot, he chases after it. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Hey! Hey! Fucker. </p>
            <p>The car back into the end of the street with Barry chasing it, 
              the car stops, Barry is looking directly at it. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Max, you're fucking dead. </p>
            <p>The headlights of the car come on and starts speeding towards Barry, 
              he starts to run away but the car is right behind him. He is backed 
              up against an old deserted building with nowhere to go, he is looking 
              at the car trying to think of something to do, the car pauses and 
              then rams into Barry who flips up onto the windsheild and the car 
              pushes him through the building. The car stops and someone in a 
              slicker gets out and is looking down at an injured Barry. Barry 
              is screaming for help. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Help me!!! help me!! somebody. What do you want???? </p>
            <p>The slicker-clad madman pulls out a big fishing hook. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I swear we didn't mean it , please don't.

            <p></p>
            <p>INT. - Southport hospital - Julie is getting off the elevator and 
              sees Ray. </p>
            <p><br>
              INT. - Barrys hospital room - the four former friends are all in 
              there talking about what just happened. </p>
            <p><br>
              Barry - <br>
              No for the fortieth fucking time I couldn't see his face. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              We have no choice here okay? Somebody tried to kill you last night, 
              we have to go to the police. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              No he wasn't trying to kill me last night, if he wanted me dead 
              he could've done it, he's just fucking with us. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Who is? </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              I don't know, some guy in a slicker. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Well that narrows it down, this being a quaint little fishing village 
              and all. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Since you bring it up, we all know you have a slicker. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              You are not going to throw this on me. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Come on you guys please don't do this. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              This isn't getting us anywhere. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Look, maybe we should just come clean. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              No. No. We made a pact and we're keep it. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah but this is insane now Barry look at us, this secret's killing 
              us. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              I'm not going to the police and you're not either. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Barry please, we could put an end to it and maybe salvage some small 
              fraction of a life. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              And how do we do that? Huh? There was no accident Julie it was murder, 
              your words remember? Murder. I say we find the fuck who's doing 
              this and have a little one on one. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              What like last night Bare? </p>
            <p>Barry jumps to a sitting position in his bed. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Fuck you man. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              No Barry's right, whosever doing this isn't going to the police, 
              we could this guy, talk to him. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              How do we find him? </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Well it's got to be a friend or a family member of the guy we hit. 
              What was his name?? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              David Egan. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Right...David Egan. </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - Hospital --- Julie, Ray and Helen are walking through the 
              hall ready to leave and they are discussing what they should do. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              Ray - <br>
              Look I don't think we should give up on Max, it could still be him. 
            </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Then find him Ray, prove Barry wrong, that's what you want isn't 
              it? </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              No, no, what I want is for you and me to just... </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Listen to me Ray okay, I want you to get something, there is no 
              you and me. </p>
            <p>Julie takes off down the stairs instead of waiting for the elevator. 
              Ray and Helen look at each other and Helen follows Julie. </p>
            <p><br>
              INT. - Julies house - Julie and Helen are looking up articles about 
              David Egan on the internet. </p>
            <p><br>
              Julie - <br>
              Okay I can access the local library online, I think we can cross-refrence 
              and pull up all we need to know. </p>
            <p>She finds what she is looking for and types in her querey. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Egan, David. </p>
            <p>A bunch of articles pop up on the screen. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              All these articles are about David Egan? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah or at least mention him, it should pull up anything with his 
              name. </p>
            <p>Julie- <br>
              Wait, July 5th two years ago, what's this? </p>
            <p>Julie start reading one outloud. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Susie Willis died of drowning, she was trapped in a car after it 
              skided out of control on the reefs near Dawsons beach, the driver 
              David Egan was unharmed. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              I remember that wreck two summers ago. </p>
            <p>Julie (still reading) - <br>
              Susie was engaged to David, they were gonna be married. Wait a second 
              I remember he had her name tattooed on his arm, I saw it. </p>
            <p>Julie pops up another article. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Survived by his mother Claire and sister Melissa Egan of Marible 
              County. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              They live in the sticks, what do you think? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Whadda we got to lose?? </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - Marible County Road --- Julie and Helen are driving to the 
              Egan house. <br>
              Helen is reading a map. </p>
            <p><br>
              Helen - <br>
              Turn right. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Where?? </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Back there. </p>
            <p>They back the car up to get to the road they are looking for and 
              turn down it. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              What exactly is the plan? I mean are we just gonna ring the doorbell 
              and say we killed your son and we were in the neighborhood so... 
            </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Look I thought we would scope it out then play it by ear. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Don't you think we should have some sort of a plan? Angela Landsbury 
              always had a plan. </p>
            <p>The car stops at a mailbox that has &quot;Egan&quot; written is 
              bold letters. </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - The Egans driveway --- Julie and Helen are walking towards 
              the house. </p>
            <p><br>
              Helen - <br>
              What if they're waiting for us? What if they recognize us? They 
              could have a gun and shoot us dead. </p>
            <p><br>
              Julie - <br>
              It's been a year Helen, they could have done that already. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Yeah, Jodi Foster tried this and a skinner of a serial killer answered 
              the door. </p>
            <p><br>
              They get to the house and knock on the door twice and no one answers. 
            </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Well it was a good try. </p>
            <p>Julie is not satisfied, she walks around the side of the house 
              and looks in a window. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Adding breaking and entering to our crime spree? </p>
            <p>A womans image appears in a old mirror that is sitting next to 
              the house. The woman is Missy Egan. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Can I help you? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Oh, hi, our car stalled down the road and we were just wondering 
              if maybe we could use your phone? </p>

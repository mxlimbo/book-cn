            <p>EXT. - Julies car --- Barry, Helen and Julie are walking towards 
              the car. </p>
            <p><br>
              Barry - <br>
              Are you sure he was dead? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Don't ask me that again, he was dead okay? I saw him with these... 
              with these crabs. </p>
            <p>Julie passes the keys to Barry. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              You do it. </p>
            <p>Barry opens the trunk and sees that it is empty and very clean 
              looking. Julie is upset. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              No don't, don't even, he was there god dammit and he was wearing 
              your jacket Barry. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Where'd he go? Did the crabs carry him away? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I swear to god. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              I believe you Julie. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              He took the body, he came and he took the body. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Why would he do that? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I don't know Barry okay? Why would he try to run you over? Why'd 
              he make coleslaw in Helens head? He's fucking with us. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Come on Julie let's go back to the house? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Where's your jacket Barry? Don't you see? He's got us now, okay 
              this is exactly what he wants, we can't go to the police, not now, 
              he's made sure of that. He's just out there and he's watching us 
              and waiting. </p>
            <p>She turns and looks around and starts screaming... </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              What are you waiting for huh? What are you waiting for???? </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - Helens house --- The three are walking towards the house 
              and Ray is walking towards them. </p>
            <p><br>
              Julie - <br>
              What are you doing here? </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              I've been looking everywhere for you guys. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              You're gonna die. </p>
            <p>Barry walks up and punches Ray in the face with his fist which 
              is still in a cast. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Hey, hey stop it. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              What are you going? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Stop it. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              I didn't do anything. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              You're fucking lying. He's lying. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Leave him alone Barry, get a grip. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              No wake up Julie, he's behind this. How many fucked up fishermen 
              are out there? </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Look, he's after me too. I got a letter. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Oh you got a letter? I got run over. Helen gets her hair chopped 
              off. Julie gets a body in a trunk and you get a letter?? That's 
              balanced? </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              What body? What are you talking about? </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Drop the act. You killed Max, you took my jacket. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Max is dead? </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              What is it with you Ray? You were dogging us from the start weren't 
              you? Always wanting to be our friend, always wanting to be one of 
              us but you were too fucking jealous to handle it </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Fuck you! </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Stop it! Look, we have to stick togeather alright? We have to help 
              each other. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Okay so if it's not fisherboy here then who is it and how do we 
              find him? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              We think his name is Billy Blue. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              How do you know that? </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Missy, said there was a friend named Billy Blue. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Who probably went to school with David Egan so according to sis 
              that would make him class of '92. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Elsa was class of '92. Maybe there's something in her yearbook. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              INT. - Helens bedroom --- They are all looking through the yearbook 
              at David Egans picture. </p>
            <p><br>
              Ray - <br>
              So that's him huh? Hard to believe that's the guy. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Yeah his face isn't splattered all over the road dumbass. Maybe 
              Blue's not his real name. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              That's right, he could have easily lied to Missy, we did. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Maybe we should bring the yearbook to Missy, if she had it in front 
              of her... </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              ...She could point him out. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              I'm not going anywhere. High school mugshots, what??? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I'll go, you've got that parade today. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Forget it. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              No you need to be there in case he shows up. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              I don't want him to show up. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Helen this could be our chance, we could catch him. I'll go to Missys, 
              Barry you go to the parade with Helen and don't let her out of your 
              sight, if he shows up... </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              I'll pound his ass. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Listen to yourselves, you sound like a bunch of vigulanties. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              It's july 4th Ray. Okay? This is his day. Whatever he's planned 
              in going to happend today unless we stop him. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Come on Julie, don't you see? It's that moment where we have to 
              make a decision, let's make the right one this time. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I'm not interested in what's right anymore Ray I wanna do what's 
              smart. </p>
            <p>Ray - Then let's get the hell out of here, we can leave town, disapear. 
            </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I've already disapeared, okay? Now I want my life back. Look we 
              have to face this, what's it gonna be Ray? </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - The parade --- Helen is riding the float and Barry is sitting 
              on the side. Both of them are looking all over the place for the 
              man in the slicker. Helen sees a man in a black slicker and yells 
              to Barry. </p>
            <p><br>
              Helen - <br>
              Barry. Barry! Over there.! </p>
            <p>Barry looks over and sees the man in the slicker walking away. 
              Barry chases him screaming at people to move and get out of the 
              way untill he finally tackles the man to the ground and removes 
              the hat. It's an old man who looks like Barry has given him a heartattack. 
            </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Shit! Where the hell is he? </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - Missys house - Julie is just pulling into the driveway. she 
              gets out and knocks on the door. </p>
            <p><br>
              Julie - <br>
              Missy???? Hello???? </p>
            <p>She starts to walk around the house to look for Missy when she 
              sees Missy coming at her with a knife. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Please! Missy? Missy do you remember me from the other day? You 
              know the car trouble? </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              What are you doing here? </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - The parade --- Helen is on her float looking around trying 
              to find Barry, she looks up and sees a man standing on a building 
              looking at her, he is wearing a slicker and he pulls his big hook, 
              it's the killer. Helen is scared. </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - Missys house --- Missy and Julie are talking out by an old 
              shed. Missy is cutting up some rotten looking fish. </p>
            <p><br>
              Julie - Please we need to talk. I need to find your brothers friend 
              Billy Blue, I need to talk to him and I was thinking that maybe 
              you could look through this yearbook? </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Now what's this all about? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Well it's too crazy to explain but it has to do with your brother 
              and last july 4th. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              What about it? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              What happened to your brother wasn't an acident, there's more to 
              it than that. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              I know. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              You know what? </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Well he killed himself. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              He what? </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Yeah he went up there to die that night that's where Susie died. 
              See the whole town blammed him for her death so he blammed himself. 
            </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              But how do you know it was a suicide? </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              He left a note. </p>
            <p>Missy walks over to the decaying tool shed and gets out the note. 
            </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              I had to keep this hidden from the insurance company cause they 
              wouldn't pay me the money if it was suicide. That don't much matter 
              anymore cause the money's been spent. That's it. </p>
            <p>She passes the note to Julie which says &quot;I WILL NEVER FORGET 
              LAST SUMMER&quot;. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              This isn't a suicide note. This is a death threat. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              What are you... What are you talking about? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Your brother didn't kill himself Missy, I saw him, I was there and 
              whoever sent this was there too. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              What do you mean you saw him? Where? Where did you see him? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              He was crossing the road, we hit him, it was an accident. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              No! My brother drowned. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I saw him, he has Susie tattooed on his arm. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Tattoo? He doesn't have a tattoo on his arm. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I saw it on his right forearm. </p>
            <p>Missy is getting upset at what Julie is saying. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              You didn't seeanything, get out of here. Get out of my house. </p>
            <p>Missy puts the letter away and disapears. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Oh my god, it wasn't your brother. </p>

            <p>　　Soul Mountain Gao Xingjian </p>
            <p>　　Translation by Mabel Lee 　 　　 </p>
            <p>　　Chapter One </p>
            <p>　　The old bus is a city reject. After shaking in it for twelve 
              hours on the potholed highway since early morning you arrive in 
              this mountain county town in the South. </p>
            <p>　　In the bus station littered with ice-lollipop papers and sugar 
              cane scraps, you stand with your backpack and a bag and look around 
              for a while. </p>
            <p>　　People are getting off the bus or walking past, men humping sacks 
              and women carrying babies. A crowd of youths, unhampered by sacks 
              or baskets, have their hands free. They take sunflower seeds out 
              of their pockets, toss them one at a time into their mouths and 
              spit out the shells. With a loud crack the kernels are expertly 
              eaten. To be leisurely and carefree is endemic to the place. They 
              are locals and life has made them like this, they have been here 
              for many generations and you wouldn't need to go looking anywhere 
              else for them. The earliest to leave the place, of course at the 
              time this bus station didn't exist and probably there weren't any 
              buses, travelled by river in the black canopy boats and overland 
              in hired carts or by foot if they didn't have the money. Nowadays, 
              as long as they are still able to travel they flock back home, even 
              from the other side of the Pacific, arriving in cars or big air-conditioned 
              coaches. The rich, the famous, and the nothing in particular all 
              hurry back because they are getting old. After all, who doesn't 
              love the home of their ancestors? Of course they don't intend to 
              stay so they walk around looking relaxed, talking and laughing loudly, 
              and effusing fondness and affection for the place. Here, when friends 
              meet they don't just give a nod or a handshake in the meaningless 
              ritual of city people, they shout the person's name or thump him 
              on the back. Hugging is also common but not for women, who don't 
              do this. By the cement trough where the buses are washed, two young 
              women hold hands as they chat. The women here have lovely voices 
              and you can't help taking a second look. The one with her back to 
              you is wearing an indigo-print head scarf. This type of scarf, and 
              how it's tied, dates back many generations but is seldom seen nowadays. 
              You find yourself walking towards them. The scarf is tied under 
              her chin and the two ends point up. She has a beautiful face. Her 
              features are delicate, so is her slim body. You pass close by them. 
              They have been holding hands all this time, both have red coarse 
              hands and strong fingers. Both are probably recent brides back seeing 
              relatives and friends, or visiting parents. Here, the word xifu 
              means one's own daughter-in-law and using it like rustic Northerners 
              to refer to any young married woman will immediately incur angry 
              abuse. On the other hand, a married woman calls her own husband 
              laogong yet your laogong, and my laogong are also used. People here 
              speak with a unique intonation even though they are descendants 
              of the same legendary emperors and are of the same culture and race. 
            </p>
            <p>　　You yourself can't explain why you're here. It happened that 
              you were on a train and this person mentioned a place called Lingshan. 
              He was sitting opposite and your cup was next to his. As the train 
              moved, the lids on the cups clattered against one another. If the 
              lids kept on clattering or clattered and then stopped, that would 
              have been the end of it. However, whenever you and he were about 
              to separate the cups, the clattering would stop, and as soon as 
              you and he looked away the clattering would start again. He and 
              you reached out, but again the clattering stopped. The two of you 
              laughed at the same instant, put the cups well apart, and started 
              a conversation. You ask him where he is going. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Lingshan.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;What?&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Lingshan, ling meaning spirit or soul, and shan meaning 
              mountain.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　You've been to lots of places, visited lots of famous mountains, 
              but have never heard of this place. </p>
            <p>　　Your friend opposite has closed his eyes and is dozing. Like 
              anyone else, you can't help being curious and naturally want to 
              know which famous places you've missed on your travels. Also, you 
              like doing things properly and it's annoying that there's a place 
              you haven't even heard about. You ask him about the location of 
              Lingshan. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;At the source of the You River,&quot; he says opening his 
              eyes. </p>
            <p>　　You don't know this You River, either, but are embarrassed about 
              asking and give an ambiguous nod which can mean either &quot;I see, 
              thanks&quot; or &quot;Oh, I know the place.&quot; This satisfies 
              your desire for superiority but not your curiosity. After a while 
              you ask how to get there and the route up the mountain. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Take the train to Wuyizhen, then go upstream by boat on 
              the You River.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;What's there? Scenery? Temples? Historic sites?&quot; you 
              ask, trying to be casual. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's all virgin wilderness.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ancient forests?&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Of course, but not just ancient forests.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;What about Wild Men?&quot; you say, joking. </p>
            <p>　　He laughs but without any sarcasm, and he doesn't seem to be 
              making fun of himself which intrigues you even more. You have to 
              find out more about him. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Are you an ecologist? A biologist? An anthropologist? An 
              archaeologist?&quot; </p>
            <p>　　He shakes his head each time then says, &quot;I'm more interested 
              in living people.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;So you're doing research on folk customs? You're a sociologist? 
              An ethnographer? An ethnologist? A journalist, perhaps? An adventurer?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm an amateur in all of these.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　The two of you start laughing. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm an expert amateur in all of these!&quot; </p>
            <p>　　The laughing makes you and him cheerful. He lights a cigarette 
              and can't stop as he tells you about the wonders of Lingshan. Afterwards, 
              at your request, he tears up his empty cigarette box and draws a 
              map of the route up Lingshan. </p>
            <p>　　In the North, it is already late autumn. Here, however, the summer 
              heat hasn't completely subsided. Before sunset, it is still quite 
              hot in the sun and sweat starts running down your back. You leave 
              the station to look around. There's nothing nearby except for the 
              little inn across the road. It's an old style building with a wooden 
              shopfront and an upstairs. Upstairs the floorboards creak badly 
              but worse still is the grime on the pillow and sleeping mat. To 
              wash, you'd have to wait till it was dark to strip off and pour 
              water over yourself in the damp narrow courtyard. This is a stopover 
              for the village peddlers and craftsmen. </p>
            <p>　　It's well before dark, so there's plenty of time to find somewhere 
              clean. You walk down the road with your backpack to look over the 
              little town, hoping to find some indication, a billboard or a poster, 
              or just the name &quot;Lingshan&quot; to tell you you're on the 
              right track and haven't been tricked into making this long excursion. 
              You look everywhere but don't find anything. There were no tourists 
              like you amongst the other passengers who got off the bus. Of course 
              you're not that sort of tourist, it's just what you're wearing: 
              strong sensible sports shoes and a backpack with shoulder straps, 
              no-one else is dressed like you. Of course, this isn't one of the 
              tourist spots frequented by newlyweds and retirees. Those places 
              have been transformed by tourism, coaches are parked everywhere 
              and tourist maps are on sale. Tourist hats, tourist T-shirts, tourist 
              singlets and tourist handkerchiefs bearing the name of the place 
              are in all the little shops and stalls, and the name of the place 
              is used in the trade names of all the &quot;foreign exchange currency 
              only&quot; hotels for foreigners, the &quot;locals with references 
              only&quot; hostels and sanatoriums, and of course the small private 
              hotels competing for customers. You haven't come to enjoy yourself 
              in one of those places on the sunny side of a mountain where people 
              congregate just to look at and jostle one another, and to add to 
              the litter of melon rind, fruit peel, soft drink bottles, cans, 
              cartons, sandwich wrappings and cigarette butts. Sooner or later 
              this place will also boom but you're here before they put up the 
              gaudy pavilions and terraces, before the reporters come with their 
              cameras, and before the celebrities come to put up plaques with 
              their calligraphy. You can 't help feeling rather pleased with yourself 
              yet you're anxious. There's no sign of anything here for tourists, 
              have you made a blunder? You're only going by the map on the cigarette 
              box in your shirt pocket, what if the expert amateur you met on 
              the train had only heard about the place on his travels? How do 
              you know he wasn't just making it all up? You haven't ever seen 
              the place mentioned in travel accounts and it's not listed in the 
              most up to date travel manuals. Of course, it isn't hard to find 
              places like Lingtai, Lingqiu, Lingyan and even Lingshan on provincial 
              maps and you know very well that in the histories and classics, 
              Lingshan appears in works dating back to the ancient shamanistic 
              work Classic of the Mountains and Seas, and the old geographical 
              gazetteer Annotated Water Classic. It was also at Lingshan that 
              Buddha enlightened the Venerable Mahakashyapa. You're not stupid, 
              so just use your brains, first find this place Wuyizhen on the cigarette 
              box, for this is how you'll get to Lingshan.</p>

            <p>　　You return to the bus station and go into the waiting room. The 
              busiest place in this small town is now deserted. The ticket window 
              and the parcel window are boarded up from the inside so knocking 
              is useless. There's nowhere to ask so you can only go through the 
              lists of stops above the ticket window: Zhang Village, Sandy Flat, 
              Cement Factory, Old Hut, Golden Horse, Good Harvest, Flood Waters, 
              Dragon Bay, Peach Blossom Hollow…the names keep getting better, 
              but the place you want isn't there. This is just a small town but 
              there are several routes and quite a few buses go through. The busiest 
              route, with five or six buses a day, is to Cement Factory but that's 
              definitely not a tourist route. The route with the fewest buses, 
              one a day, is sure to go to the furthest destination: it turns out 
              that Wuyizhen is the last stop. There's nothing special about the 
              name, it's just like any other place name and there's nothing magical 
              about it. Still, you seem to have found one end of a hopeless tangle, 
              you may not be ecstatic but you're certainly relieved. You'll need 
              to buy a ticket in the morning an hour before departure and you 
              know from experience that with mountain buses like this, which run 
              once a day, just to get on will be a fight. Unless you're prepared 
              to do battle, you'll just have to get into the queue early. </p>
            <p>　　But, right now, you've got lots of time, although your backpack's 
              a nuisance. As you amble along the road timber trucks go by noisily 
              sounding their horns. In the town the noise is worse still as trucks, 
              some with trailers, blast on their horns and conductors hang out 
              of windows loudly banging the sides of the buses to get pedestrians 
              off the road. </p>
            <p>　　The old buildings on both sides stand flush with the road and 
              all have wooden shopfronts. The downstairs is for business and upstairs, 
              washing hung out to dry-nappies, bras, underpants with patched crotches, 
              floral-print bedspreads -like flags of all the nations, flap in 
              the noise and dust of the traffic. The concrete telegraph poles 
              along the street are pasted at eye level with all sorts of posters. 
              One for curing body odour catches your attention. This is not because 
              you've got body odour but because of the fancy language and the 
              words in brackets after &quot;body odour&quot;. </p>
            <p>　　Body odour (known also as scent of the immortals) is a disgusting 
              condition with an awful, nauseating smell. It often affects social 
              relationships and can delay life's major event: marriage. It disadvantages 
              young men and women at job interviews or when they try to enlist, 
              therefore inflicting much suffering and anguish. By using a new 
              total treatment, we can instantly eradicate the odour with a rate 
              of up to 97.53% success. For joy in life and future happiness, we 
              welcome you to come and rid yourself of it… </p>
            <p>　　After that you come to a stone bridge: no body odour here and 
              there's a cool, refreshing breeze. The bridge spanning the broad 
              river has a bitumen surface but the carved monkeys on the worn stone 
              posts testify to its long history. You lean on the concrete railing 
              and survey the township alongside the bridge. On both banks, black 
              roof-tops overlapping like fish-scales stretch endlessly into the 
              distance. The valley opens out between two mountains where the upper 
              areas of gold paddy fields are inlaid with clusters of green bamboos. 
              The river is blue and clear as it leisurely trickles over the sandy 
              shores but close to the granite pylons dividing the current it becomes 
              inky green and deep. Just past the hump of the bridge the rushing 
              water churns loudly and white foam surfaces from whirlpools. The 
              ten-metre high stone embankment is stained with water levels: the 
              new greyish-yellow lines were probably left by the recent summer 
              floods. Can this be the You River? And does it flow down from Lingshan? 
            </p>
            <p>　　The sun is about to set. The bright orange disc is infused with 
              light but there's no glare. You gaze into the distance at the hazy 
              layers of jagged peaks where the two sides of the valley join. This 
              ominous black image nibbles at the lower edges of the glowing sun 
              which seems to be revolving. The sun turns a dark red, gentler, 
              and projects brilliant gold reflections onto the entire bend of 
              the river: the dark blue of the water fusing with the dazzling sunlight 
              throbs and pulsates. As the red disc seats itself in the valley 
              it becomes serene, awesomely beautiful, and there are sounds. You 
              hear sounds, elusive, distinctly reverberating from deep in your 
              heart and radiating outwards until the sun seems to prop itself 
              up on its toes, stumble, then sink into the black shadows of the 
              mountains, scattering glowing colours throughout the sky. An evening 
              wind blows noisily by your ears and cars drive past, as usual sounding 
              their deafening horns. You cross the bridge and see there a new 
              stone with engraved characters painted in red: &quot;Yongning Bridge. 
              Built in the third year of the Kaiyuan reign period of the Song 
              Dynasty and repaired in 1962. This stone was laid in 1983.&quot; 
              It no doubt marks the beginning of the tourist industry here. </p>
            <p>　　Two food stalls stand at the end of the bridge. In the one on 
              the left you eat a bowl of beancurd, the smooth and tasty kind with 
              all the right ingredients. Hawkers used to sell it in the streets 
              and lanes; it completely disappeared some time ago but has now revived 
              as family enterprises. In the stall on the right you eat two delicious 
              sesame-coated shallot pancakes, straight off the stove and piping-hot. 
              Then at one of the stalls, you can't remember which one, you eat 
              a bowl of sweet yuanxiao dumplings broiled in rice wine: they are 
              the size of large pearls. Of course, you're not as academic about 
              food as Mr Ma the Second who toured West Lake but you do have a 
              hefty appetite. You savour this food of your ancestors and listen 
              to customers chatting with the proprietors. They're mostly locals 
              and all know one another. You try using the mellifluous local accent 
              to be friendly, you want to be one of them. You've lived in the 
              city for a long time and need to feel that you have a hometown. 
              You want a hometown so that you'll be able return to your childhood 
              to recollect long lost memories.</p>
            <p>　　On this side of the bridge you eventually find an inn on an old 
              cobblestone street. The wooden floors have been mopped and it's 
              clean enough. You get a small single room which has a plank bed 
              with a bamboo mat on it. The cotton blanket is a suspicious grey, 
              either it hasn't been washed properly or that's the original colour. 
              You throw aside the greasy pillow from under the bamboo mat and 
              luckily it's hot so you can do without the bedding. What you need 
              right now is to off-load your luggage which has become quite heavy, 
              wash off the dust and sweat, strip, and stretch yourself out on 
              the bed. There's shouting and yelling next door. They're gambling 
              and you can hear them picking up and throwing down the cards. A 
              timber partition separates you and, through the holes poked into 
              the paper covering the cracks, you make out the blurred figures 
              of some bare-chested men. You're not so tired that you can drop 
              off to sleep just like that. You tap on the wall and instantly there 
              's loud shouting next door. They're not shouting at you but amongst 
              themselves: there are always winners and losers and the loser is 
              trying to get out of paying. They're openly gambling in the inn 
              despite the Public Security Office notice on the wall prohibiting 
              gambling and prostitution: you decide to check whether the law has 
              any effect. You put on some clothes, go down the corridor and knock 
              on the half-closed door. Your knocking makes no difference, they 
              keep shouting and yelling inside and nobody takes notice. So you 
              push open the door and go in. The four men sitting around the bed 
              in the middle of the room all turn to look at you. But it's you 
              and not they who gets a rude shock. The men all have bits of paper 
              stuck on their faces, on the forehead, lips, nose and cheeks, and 
              they look ugly and ridiculous. They aren't laughing and are glaring 
              at you. You've butted in and they're clearly annoyed.</p>

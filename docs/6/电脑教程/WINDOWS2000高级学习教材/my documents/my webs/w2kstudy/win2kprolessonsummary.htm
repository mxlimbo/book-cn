<b><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">一、<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt">Windows 2000 
Professional</span></b></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Windows 2000 Professional improves 
the capabilities of previous versions of Windows in five main areas: ease of 
use, simplified management, increased hardware support, enhanced file 
management, and enhanced security features.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Some of the ease-of-use 
improvements include enhancements to the user interface, such as a customized 
Start menu that presents only the programs that you use most often, and improved 
Log On and Shut Down dialog boxes. Windows 2000 Professional includes support 
for the latest laptop technologies based on APM and ACPI, and provides a Network 
Connection wizard and VPN support. It provides Offline Folders that allow you to 
copy documents stored on the network to your local computer for access when you 
are offline; and it provides Synchronization Manager</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Courier New">―</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">which 
compares items on the network to items that you opened or updated while working 
offline</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Courier New">―</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">and 
synchronizes them.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Printing in Windows 2000 
Professional has also been improved. IPP allows users to print to a URL over an 
intranet or the Internet, view printer and job- related information in HTML 
format from any browser, and download and install printer drivers over the 
Internet. The Windows 2000 Add Printer wizard simplifies the process of 
connecting to local and network printers from within a program, and Image Color 
Management 2 allows you to send high-quality color documents to a printer or 
another computer with greater speed and reliability than ever before.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Windows 2000 also simplifies the 
process of setting up a computer. The Windows 2000 System Preparation tool 
allows you to create an image of a computer's hard disk so that you can use a 
third-party tool to duplicate the hard disk on similarly configured computers. 
The Setup Manager wizard guides you through the process of creating answer files 
for unattended installation scripts.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
now supports more than 7,000 hardware devices, such as infrared devices, 
scanners, digital cameras, and advanced multimedia devices. Other enhancements 
to hardware support include the following: an Add/Remove Hardware wizard that 
allows you to add, remove, troubleshoot, and upgrade computer peripherals; a 
Win32 Driver Model that allows device drivers written to the WDM to work in both 
Windows 98 and Windows 2000; enhanced Plug and Play support; power options that 
prevent unnecessary power drains on your system by directing power to devices as 
they need it; and support for DirectX 7. Windows 2000 Professional also supports 
symmetric multiprocessing, which means it is capable of running on computers 
containing more than one processor.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Windows 2000 Professional 
enhancements to file management capabilities include a disk defragmenter utility 
and an NTFS file system that supports file encryption, distributed link 
tracking, and per-user disk quotas to monitor and limit disk space use. A Backup 
utility allows you to back up data to a wide variety of storage media: tape 
drives, external hard disks, zip disks, recordable CD-ROMs, and logical drives.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Windows 2000 Professional is the 
most secure Windows desktop operating system for either a stand-alone computer 
or any type of public or private network. Security features and enhancements in 
Windows 2000 Professional include support for Kerberos 5; Encrypting File 
System, which strengthens security by encrypting files on your hard disk; and 
IPSec, which encrypts TCP/IP traffic and provides the highest levels of security 
for VPN traffic across the Internet.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt">Windows 2000 
Workgroups and Domains</span></b></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">A Windows 2000 workgroup is a 
logical grouping of networked computers that share resources, such as files and 
printers. Workgroups are referred to as peer-to-peer networks because all 
computers in the workgroup can share resources as equals (peers), without a 
dedicated server. Security and administration aren't centralized in a workgroup 
because each computer maintains a list of user accounts and resource security 
information for that computer.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">A Windows 2000 domain is a logical 
grouping of network computers that share a central directory database that 
contains user accounts and security information for the domain. This directory 
database is known as the Directory and is the database portion of Active 
Directory directory services, which is the Windows 2000 directory service. In a 
domain, security and administration are centralized because the Directory 
resides on domain controllers, which manage all security-related aspects of 
user/domain interactions. To create a domain, at least one computer must be 
running a Windows 2000 server product and must have Active Directory directory 
services installed on it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -21.0pt; margin-left: 21.0pt; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<b><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">三、<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt">Getting Started</span></b></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">This lesson identified the 
preinstallation tasks you must understand and complete before you install 
Windows 2000. The first task is to identify the hardware requirements for 
installing Windows 2000 Professional and to ensure that your hardware meets 
these requirements. You learned about the Windows 2000 hardware compatibility 
list and that your hardware should be on the HCL so that it's compatible with 
Windows 2000.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">After you have determined that your 
hardware is on the HCL, you must decide how you want to partition the hard disk 
on which you are going to install Windows 2000. You must also determine whether 
you are going to format the partition as NTFS so that you can have better 
security and a richer feature set, or as FAT or FAT32 so that other operating 
systems can access the data on the installation partition.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">In addition, you learned about 
Client Access Licenses (CALs) and that a CAL gives client computers</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Courier New">―</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">for 
example, a computer running Windows 2000 Professional</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Courier New">―</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">the 
right to connect to computers running Windows 2000 Server. You learned that you 
must select Per Seat or Per Server licensing on the server. With Per Seat 
licensing mode, a separate CAL is required for each client computer that 
accesses a Windows 2000 Server. When a client computer has a CAL, it can be used 
to access any computer running Windows 2000 Server on the enterprise network. 
With Per Server licensing, CALs are assigned to a particular server. Each CAL 
allows one connection per client computer to the server, and you must have at 
least as many CALs that are dedicated to the server as the maximum number of 
client computers that will be used to concurrently connect to that server at any 
time.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">You also learned that during 
installation, your computer must join a domain or a workgroup. If your computer 
is the first one installed on the network, or if for some other reason no domain 
is available for your computer to join, you can have the computer join a 
workgroup and then have the computer join a domain after the installation. This 
lesson also provided a checklist of preinstallation tasks that you can complete 
to help ensure a successful installation of Windows 2000.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -21.0pt; margin-left: 21.0pt; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<b><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">四、<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt">Introducing the 
Microsoft Management Console</span></b></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">In this lesson, you learned that 
one of the primary administrative tools that you use to manage Windows 2000 is 
the Microsoft Management Console. The MMC provides a standardized method to 
create, save, and open administrative tools, which are called consoles. Consoles 
hold one or more applications called snap-ins, which you use to perform 
administrative tasks and troubleshoot problems locally and on remote computers. 
By default, Windows 2000 saves custom console files (with an .MSC extension) in 
the Administrative Tools folder of the user who created it.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">You learned that every console has 
a console tree. The console tree displays the hierarchical organization of the 
snap-ins that are contained within that console. This allows you to easily 
locate a specific snap-in. The details pane lists the contents of the active 
snap-in. You also learned about the two types of snap-ins: stand-alone snap-ins 
and extension snap-ins. A stand-alone snap-in is usually referred to simply as a 
snap-in and provides one function or a related set of functions. An extension 
snap-in is usually referred to as an extension, and it provides additional 
administrative functionality to a snap-in. An extension is designed to work with 
one or more stand-alone snap-ins, based on the function of the stand-alone 
snap-in.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Finally, in this lesson you learned 
about console options. You use console options to determine how each console 
operates by selecting the appropriate console mode. The two available console 
modes are Author mode and User mode. When you save a console in Author mode, you 
enable full access to all MMC functionality, which includes modifying the 
console. You save the console using Author mode to allow those using it to add 
or remove snap-ins, create new windows, view all portions of the console tree, 
and save consoles. Usually, if you plan to distribute a console to other 
administrators, save the console in User mode. When you set a console to User 
mode, users can't add snap-ins to, remove snap-ins from, or save the console.</span></p>

<b><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">五、<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

System Settings</span></b></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Enhancing Performance</span></b></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">You can enhance your system's 
performance in several ways. First, if your computer has multiple hard disks, 
you can create a paging file for each disk. Distributing information across 
multiple paging files improves performance because the hard disk controller can 
read from and write to multiple hard disks simultaneously. When attempting to 
write to the paging file, VMM tries to write the page data to the paging file on 
the disk that is the least busy.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Second, you can enhance your 
system's performance by moving the paging file off the drive that contains the 
Windows 2000 <i>systemroot</i> folder (by default, the Winnt folder). Moving the 
paging file off the drive containing the boot partition avoids competition 
between the various reading and writing requests. If you place a paging file on 
the Windows 2000 system partition to facilitate recovery, you can still increase 
performance by creating multiple paging files. Because the VMM alternates write 
operations between paging files, the paging file on the boot partition is 
accessed less frequently.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Third, you can enhance your 
system's performance by setting the initial size of the paging file to the value 
displayed in the Virtual Memory dialog box's Maximum Size box. This eliminates 
the time required to enlarge the file from the initial size to the maximum size.</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 5 0cm"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">How 
Windows 2000 Sets Environment Variables</span></h3>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Windows 2000 sets the environment 
by first searching the Autoexec.bat file, if it exists, and setting any 
environment variables. Next the system environment variables are set. If any 
conflicts exist with the environment variables set from the search of the 
Autoexec.bat file, the system environment variables override them. Finally the 
user environment variables are set. If any conflicts exist with environment 
variables set from the search of the Autoexec.bat file or from the system 
environment variables, the user environment variables override them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -21.0pt; margin-left: 21.0pt; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<b><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">六、<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt">Introduction to Disk 
Management</span></b></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">In this lesson, you learned that 
before you can store data on a new hard disk, you must use the Disk Management 
snap-in to initialize the disk with a storage type. Windows 2000 supports basic 
storage and dynamic storage. A basic disk can contain primary partitions, 
extended partitions, and logical drives. All versions of Microsoft Windows, 
MS-DOS, and Windows 2000 support basic storage. For Windows 2000, basic storage 
is the default, so all disks are basic disks until you convert them to dynamic 
storage.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">You also learned that dynamic 
storage creates a single partition that includes the entire disk. You divide 
dynamic disks into volumes, which can consist of a portion, or portions, of one 
or more physical disks. A dynamic disk can contain simple volumes, spanned 
volumes, and striped volumes. Dynamic storage doesn't have the restrictions of 
basic storage; for example, you can size and resize a dynamic disk without 
restarting Windows 2000.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then you learned that after you 
create partitions on a basic disk or create volumes on a dynamic disk, you must 
format the partition or volume with a specific file system such as NTFS, FAT, or 
FAT32. The file system that you choose affects disk operations. This includes 
how you control user access to data, how data is stored, how much hard disk 
capacity you have, and which operating systems can gain access to the data on 
the hard disk. You use the Disk Management snap-in to configure and manage your 
network storage space.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt">Understanding Active 
Directory Directory Services</span></b></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Active Directory directory services 
are the directory services included in the Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
products. Active Directory directory services are not included in Windows 2000 
Professional, but if your Windows 2000 Professional clients are in a Windows 
2000 domain, the features and benefits provided by Active Directory directory 
services are also available on the clients.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">A directory service is a network 
service that identifies all resources on a network and makes them accessible to 
users and applications. Active Directory directory services include the 
Directory, which stores information about network resources, such as user data, 
printers, servers, databases, groups, computers, and security policies. The 
Directory can scale from a small installation with a few hundred objects to a 
huge installation with millions of objects.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Active Directory directory services 
use DNS as their domain naming and location service. Therefore, Windows 2000 
domain names are also DNS names. Windows 2000 Server uses DDNS, so clients with 
dynamically assigned addresses can register directly with a server running the 
DNS Service and dynamically update the DNS table. In a homogeneous environment, 
DDNS eliminates the need for other Internet naming services, such as WINS.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">In this lesson, you learned that 
when you copy or move files and folders, the permissions you set on the files or 
folders might change. Rules control how and when permissions change. For 
example, when you copy files or folders from one folder to another folder, or 
from one volume to another volume, permissions change. Windows 2000 treats the 
file or folder as a new file or folder, and therefore, it takes on the 
permissions of the destination folder.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">You also learned that you must have 
Write permission for the destination folder to copy files and folders. When you 
copy a file, you become the CREATOR OWNER of the file. When you move a file or 
folder within a single NTFS volume, the file or folder retains the original 
permissions. However, when you move a file or folder between NTFS volumes, the 
file or folder inherits the permissions of the destination folder.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">An effective backup strategy is 
likely to combine different backup types. Some backup types require more time to 
back up data but less time to restore data. Conversely, other backup types 
require less time to back up data but more time to restore data. If you combine 
backup types, markers are critical. Incremental and differential backup types 
check for and rely on the markers.</span></p>

Monday a normal backup is performed, and on Tuesday through Friday, differential 
backups are performed. Differential backups don't clear markers, which means 
that each backup includes all changes since Monday. If data becomes corrupt on 
Friday, you need to restore only the normal backup from Monday and the 
differential backup from Thursday. This strategy takes more time to back up but 
less time to restore. </span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">In this lesson, you learned that 
monitoring network resources helps you to determine whether the network resource 
is still needed and whether it is secure. Monitoring resources also helps you to 
plan for future growth. Windows 2000 includes the Computer Management and Shared 
Folders snap-ins so that you can easily monitor access to network resources. You 
can monitor resources on the local computer or on a remote computer. To monitor 
resources on a remote computer, you specify the computer on which you want to 
monitor resources when you add either the Computer Management or Shared Folders 
snap-in to a custom console.</span></p>

<h2 style="margin: 5 0cm"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">The Layer 
Two Tunneling Protocol</span></h2>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol 
(L2TP) is similar to PPTP in that its primary purpose is to create an encrypted 
tunnel through an untrusted network. L2TP differs from PPTP in that it provides 
tunneling but not encryption. L2TP provides a secure tunnel by cooperating with 
other encryption technologies such as IPSec. IPSec doesn't require L2TP, but its 
encryption functions complement L2TP to create a secure VPN solution.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Both PPTP and L2TP use PPP to 
provide an initial envelope for the data and then append additional headers for 
transport through the transit internetwork. Some of the key differences between 
PPTP and L2TP are as follows:</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: -18.0pt; margin-left: 36.0pt; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">

</span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">PPTP requires an 
IP-based transit internetwork. L2TP requires only that the tunnel media provide 
packet-oriented, point-to-point connectivity. L2TP can use User Datagram 
Protocol (UDP), Frame Relay permanent virtual circuits (PVCs), X.25 VCs, or 
asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) VCs to operate over an IP network. </span></p>

  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><span lang="EN-US">L2TP supports

<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">In this lesson, you learned that 
Windows NT version 4 included support for several authentication protocols used 
to verify the credentials of users connecting to the network. These protocols 
included the following: PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP, SPAP, and PPTP, which provides 
tunneling capabilities.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">You also learned that Windows 2000 
includes support for these and several additional protocols that drastically 
increase your authentication, encryption, and multilinking options. These 
include EAP, an extension to PPP that works with dial-up, PPTP, and L2TP 
clients; RADIUS, which allows user authentication to be vendor-independent and 
provides highly scaleable authentication designs for performance and 
fault-tolerant designs for reliability; IPSec, a framework of open standards for 
ensuring secure private communications over IP networks by using cryptographic 
security services; L2TP, which is similar to PPTP in that its primary purpose is 
to create an encrypted tunnel through an untrusted network, but different from 
PPTP in that it provides tunneling but not encryption; and BAP and BACP, which 
enhance multilinked devices by dynamically adding or dropping links on demand.</span></p>

control set contains configuration data used to control the system, such as a 
list of which device drivers and services to load and which to start. Control 
sets are stored as subkeys of the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM, and a 
typical Windows 2000 installation contains the following control sets: Clone, 
ControlSet001, ControlSet002, and CurrentControlSet. The registry might contain 
several other control sets, depending on how often you have changed or had 
problems with system settings.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">You also learned that if you make 
incorrect changes to a computer's configuration, you might have problems 
restarting your computer. If you can't restart your computer because of a 
configuration change, Windows 2000 provides the last known good process so that 
you don't have to reinstall your Windows 2000 software to restart your computer. 
You can boot your computer using the LastKnownGood control set. The 
LastKnownGood control set contains the configuration settings from the last 
successful restart and logon to your computer. After restarting your computer 
using the LastKnownGood control set, you can reconfigure the computer. The last 
known good process uses the LastKnownGood control set, stored in the registry, 
to restart Windows 2000.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">In this lesson, you learned that 
the advanced boot options available in Windows 2000 include Safe Mode, Safe Mode 
With Networking, and Safe Mode With Command Prompt; Enable Boot Logging; Enable 
VGA Mode; Last Known Good Configuration; Directory Services Restore Mode; and 
Debugging Mode. These options allow you to attempt to restart your computer when 
a problem occurs with a normal boot. The Directory Services Restore Mode and 
Debugging Mode options aren't available for Windows 2000 Professional. The Boot 
Normally advanced boot option allows you to bypass these options and proceed 
with a normal boot.</span></p>

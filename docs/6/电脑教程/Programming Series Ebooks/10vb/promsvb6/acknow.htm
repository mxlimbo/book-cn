<H1>Acknowledgments</H1>

<P>Several people have helped me make this book, and it's such a joy to have an 
opportunity to publicly thank them all.

<P>I'd like to especially mention four of my best friends, who dedicated some 
of their evenings and nights to reviewing the manuscript while I was writing it. 
Marco Losavio is a great Visual Basic programmer and was precious help in refining all 
the chapters about VBA, classes, and controls. Luigi Intonti has that special intuition 
that makes a developer a great developer and used it to help me enrich the book 
with some tricky techniques and tips. Giuseppe Dimauro, simply the finest C++ 
programmer I have ever met on this side of the Atlantic Ocean, revealed to me many 
intriguing details about Windows architecture. Finally, the sections about database 
and Internet programming wouldn't have been complete and accurate without the 
support of Francesco Albano, who has amazed me by always having the correct 
answers to all my questions about Jet, SQL Server, and Windows DNA architecture. 
Marco, Luigi, Giuseppe, and Francesco are well-known Italian technical writers, and I 
hope you'll read some of their works in English on my 
<A HREF="http://www.vb2themax.com" target="_window2"><I>www.vb2themax.com</I></A> Web site.

<P>The book also contains many traces of my conversations with two other 
renowned Italian authors. Giovanni Librando has shared with me his knowledge of 
ADO and COM, while Dino Esposito has given me much good advice and made many 
suggestions. Also, I'm very grateful to Matt Curland, who on several occasions helped 
me understand what happens behind the Visual Basic 
scenes.
<P>When writing a technical book, acquiring knowledge is only half the story. 
The other half consists in putting this knowledge in a form that other people can 
easily understand, especially when you're writing in a language that isn't your own 
mother tongue. In recent years, many people have devoted time teaching me how to 
write better English. They include the editors at the 
<I>Visual Basic Programmer's Journal</I> magazine, especially Lee Th&eacute; and Patrick Meader. I also want to thank 
editor-in-chief Jeff Hadfield for permission to mention a couple of interesting tips that 
originally appeared in the magazine's Tech Tips supplement, and of course, publisher 
Jim Fawcette for the opportunity to write for VBPJ in the first place.

<P>I was so excited to write this book with Microsoft Press, and I was even 
happier when I finally met the people I had worked with for these nine months. 
Kathleen Atkins, Marzena Makuta, and Sally Stickney are among the best editors an author 
can hope to work with. In spite of all the text they had to revert from italics to 
roman, and vice versa, they often found the time to explain to me all the subtle dos and 
don'ts of the editing black art. And big thanks to Eric Stroo, the one who started it all 
and gave me the chance to write the book that I always wanted to write.

<P>Finally, I am grateful to Dave Sanborn, Keith Jarrett, Pat Metheny, and 
Jan Garbarek, a few of the many great musicians who provided the soundtrack for 
this book. Their music kept me company for many nights and helped even more 
than the one thousand cups of espresso coffee I drank during these months.

<P>I still haven't mentioned the two people who have helped me more 
than anyone else. It's not a coincidence that they are also the ones I love most.

<P>Thank you, Andrea, for always strolling in my room and insisting on 
playing on my knees with those weird widgets called mouse and keyboard. In the end, I 
had to give up my Windows NT Server system for your experiments with Paint and 
WordArt, but in return you continuously reminded me of how exciting being the dad of a 
lively two-year-old baby is.

<P>Thank you, Adriana, for convincing me to write this book and for helping 
me be in the right humor and find the concentration to be at my best to write it. 
Living together is more and more like a fascinating, never-ending journey. What else can 
I say? You're simply the best wife I could dream of.

<P>This book is dedicated to you both.

<A NAME="68"><h1>Intrinsic Controls</h1></A>

<p>In Microsoft Visual Basic jargon, <I>intrinsic controls 
</I>(or <I>built-in </I>controls) are those controls visible in the Toolbox window when you launch the environment. 
This important group includes controls, such as Label, TFextbox, and 
CommandButton controls, that are used in nearly every application. As you know, Visual Basic can 
be extended using additional Microsoft ActiveX Controls (formerly known as OCX 
controls, or OLE custom controls) either provided in the Visual Basic package or 
available as commercial, shareware, or even freeware third-party products. Even if 
such external controls are often more powerful than built-in controls, intrinsic controls 
have a few advantages that you should always take into account:</p>
<UL>

<p><li> Support for intrinsic controls is included in the MSVBVM60.DLL, the 
runtime file that's distributed with every Visual Basic application. This 
means that if a program exclusively uses intrinsic controls, you don't need 
to distribute any additional OCX files, which greatly simplifies the 
installation process and reduces disk requirements.</li></p>

<p><li> In general, Visual Basic can create and display intrinsic controls faster 
than it can external ActiveX controls because the code for their 
management is already in the Visual Basic runtime module and doesn't have to 
be loaded when a form references an intrinsic control for the first time. 
Also, applications based on intrinsic controls usually perform faster on 
machines with less memory; no extra memory is needed by additional OCX modules.</li></p>

<p><li> Because programs based exclusively on intrinsic controls require 
fewer ancillary files, they can be downloaded faster through the Internet. 
Moreover, if end users previously installed any other Visual Basic 
application, Visual Basic runtime files are already installed on the target machine, 
which reduces download times to the minimum.</li></p>
</UL>
 
<p>For all these reasons, it's important to learn how to make the best of 
intrinsic controls. In this chapter, I focus on their most important properties, methods, 
and events, and I also show how to address some common programming issues 
using intrinsic controls exclusively.</p>

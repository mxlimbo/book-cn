<a name="ch04_01">1.</a>     You won't find a reference to the 
<I>CopyMemory</I> API function in the Windows API or in Visual 
Basic's API Viewer. This term was first introduced by Bruce McKinney in the first edition of his 
<I>Hardcore Visual Basic</I> (Microsoft Press, 1995) as an alias for the 
<I>hmemcopy</I> API function when working with 16-bit platforms and for 
<I>RtlMoveMemory</I> when working with 32-bit platforms. The 
<I>CopyMemory</I> name describes so closely what those functions do that it rapidly became widely used by 
Visual Basic programmers, who, in most cases, didn't even know where the term originated. This 
short note should help refresh everyone's memory and give Bruce his due.

<A NAME="460"><H1>Introduction</H1></A>

<P>This book is for database developers who want to use Microsoft Access 
2000 to build custom applications. It covers the features that make Access a 
perennial favorite with developers, as well as the innovations in Access 2000 that you 
are most likely to use in your programming projects. Numerous 
programming samples demonstrate the core development techniques and rapid 
application development tools. The sample designs have been kept simple so you 
can easily adapt them for your custom applications or apply the techniques in 
your development work. The book's companion CD contains all the samples in 
the book as well as many others.</P>

<P>Access is a popular development platform in large measure because it 
is part of the Microsoft Office suite. Many clients want their Access systems 
to interoperate with the rest of Office, and they want systems that are 
transparent and easy to maintain without developer assistance. The techniques described 
in this book will help you meet these expectations. (For additional support, you 
can consult two Microsoft World Wide Web sites: www.microsoft.com/office/, 
which covers Access capabilities in general, and 
www.microsoft.com/officedev/, which covers the product's developer features.)</P>

<P>This book was written to meet the needs of a variety of readers. 
Longtime Access developers will find the essential information on the advances 
introduced in Access 2000. Another target readership is developers who primarily use 
non-Microsoft technologies, such as dBASE or Paradox. They know all of the 
development concepts, but they do not necessarily know how to implement 
those concepts with Access. Finally, this book is for highly motivated power users 
who want to graduate to developing solutions for others and want to ramp up quickly.</P>

<P>The book's presentation style has the aim of making you productive 
as a developer, and productive in using the new features in Access 2000. 
The presentation style is <I>look, see, do!</I> The many code samples throughout the 
book illustrate concepts that you can readily put to use in your applications. 
Think of them as recipes for performing specific development tasks. Try them &quot;as 
is&quot; from the book's CD. Then, modify them to work with your data and in 
the context of your custom application requirements. The samples are 
purposefully uncomplicated, easy to understand, and easy to reuse, so that you will 
be motivated to apply them in your own applications.</P>

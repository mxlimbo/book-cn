<A NAME="553"><H1>Uniform Data Transfer&#151;Clipboard Transfer and OLE Drag and Drop</H1></A>
<P>ActiveX technology includes a powerful mechanism for transferring data within and among Microsoft Windows-based applications. The COM <I>IDataObject</I> interface is the key element of what is known as <U>Uniform</U> <U>Data</U> <U>Transfer</U>. As you'll see, Uniform Data Transfer (UDT) gives you all sorts of options for the formatting and storage of your transferred data, going well beyond standard clipboard transfers.

<P>Microsoft Foundation Class support is available for Uniform Data Transfer, but MFC's support for UDT is not so high-level as to obscure what's going on at the COM interface level. One of the useful applications of UDT is OLE Drag and Drop. Many developers want to use drag-and-drop capabilities in 
their applications, and drag-and-drop support means that programs now have a standard for information interchange. The MFC library supports drag-and-drop operations, and that, together with clipboard transfer, is the main focus of this chapter.

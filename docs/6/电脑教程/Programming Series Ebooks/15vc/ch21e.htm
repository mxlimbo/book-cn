<A NAME="457"><H1><B>The MAKEHELP Process</B></H1></A>
<P>The process of building the application's HLP file is complex. Part of the complexity results from the Help Compiler's nonacceptance of statements such as

<p><pre>
HID_MAINFRAME = ID_MAINFRAME + 0x20000
</pre>

<P>Because of the Help Compiler's nonacceptance, a special preprocessing program named makehm.exe must read the resource.h file to produce a help map file that defines the help context ID values. Below is a diagram of the entire MAKEHELP process.

<P>AppWizard generates the application's help project file (HPJ) and the help contents file (CNT). In the project file, the <I>[FILES]</I> section brings in RTF files and the <I>[MAP]</I> section contains <I>#include</I> statements for the generic and the application-specific help map (HM) files. The Help Workshop (HCRTF) processes the project file to produce the help file that WinHelp reads.

<A NAME="296"><H1>A Reusable Frame Window Base Class</H1></A>
<P>C++ promises programmers the ability to produce &quot;software Lego blocks&quot; that can be taken &quot;off the shelf&quot; and fitted easily into an application. The Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library version 6.0 classes are a good example of this kind of reusable software. This chapter shows you how to build your own reusable base class by taking advantage of what the MFC library already provides.
<P>In the process of building the reusable class, you'll learn a few more things about Microsoft Windows and the MFC library. In particular, you'll see how the application framework allows access to the Windows Registry, you'll learn more about the mechanics of the <I>CFrameWnd</I> class, and you'll get more exposure to static class variables and the <I>CString</I> class.

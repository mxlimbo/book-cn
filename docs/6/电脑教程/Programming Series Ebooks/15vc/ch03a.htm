<A NAME="35"><H1>Getting Started with AppWizard&#151;&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</H1></A><P><A HREF="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</A> sketched the MFC library version 6.0 document-view 
architecture. This hands-on chapter shows you how to build a functioning MFC 
library application, but it insulates you from the complexities of the class hierarchy 
and object interrelationships. You'll work with only one document-view 
program element, the &quot;view class&quot; that is closely associated with a window. For the 
time being, you can ignore elements such as the application class, the frame 
window, and the document. Of course, your application won't be able to save its 
data on disk, and it won't support multiple views, but Part III of this book 
provides plenty of opportunity to exploit those features.
<P>Because resources are so important in Microsoft Windows-based 
applications, you'll use ResourceView to visually explore the resources of 
your new program. You'll also get some hints for setting up your Windows 
environment for maximum build speed and optimal debugging output.

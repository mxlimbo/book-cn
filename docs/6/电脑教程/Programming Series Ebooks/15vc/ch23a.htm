<A NAME="495"><H1>MFC Programs Without Document or View Classes</H1></A>
<P>The document-view architecture is useful for many applications, but 
sometimes a simpler program structure is sufficient. This chapter illustrates three applications: a dialog-based program, a Single Document Interface (SDI) program, and a Multiple Document Interface (MDI) program. None of these programs uses document, view, or document-template classes, but they all use command routing and some other Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library features. In Visual C++ 6.0, you can create all three types of applications using AppWizard.

<P>In each example, we'll look at how AppWizard generates code that 
doesn't rely on the document-view architecture and show you how to add your 
own code to each example.

<A NAME="130"><H1>The Modal Dialog and Windows Common Controls</H1></A>
<P>Almost every Windows-based program uses a dialog window to interact with the user. The dialog might be a simple OK message box, or it might be a complex data entry form. Calling this powerful element a dialog &quot;box&quot; is an 
injustice. A dialog is truly a window that receives messages, that can be 
moved and closed, and that can even accept drawing instructions in its client area.
<P>The two kinds of dialogs are <U>modal</U> and <U>modeless</U>. This chapter explores the most common type, the modal dialog. In the first of this chapter's 
two examples, you'll use all the familiar &quot;old&quot; controls, such as the edit control and the list box, inherited from Win16. In the second example, you'll use the Windows common controls, which Microsoft Windows 95 introduced. In <A HREF="ch07a.htm">Chapter 7</A> we'll take a look at the modeless dialog and the special-purpose 
Windows common dialogs for opening files, selecting fonts, and so forth. In <A HREF="ch08a.htm">Chapter 8</A> we'll examine ActiveX Controls. Then <A HREF="ch09a.htm">Chapter 9</A> discusses the new Internet Explorer control classes, introduced in MFC 6.0

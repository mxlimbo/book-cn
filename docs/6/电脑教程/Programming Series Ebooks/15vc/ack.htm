<A NAME="1"><H1>Acknowledgments</H1></A><P>I first met David Kruglinski at a software development conference. I had just quit my job and started a new company, and I approached David at an author signing for an earlier edition of this book. Our new company was going to focus on Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC)/Microsoft Visual C++ class libraries. I hoped that David would listen to our ideas and maybe provide some feedback on our products and their usefulness to the Visual C++ development community&#151;a community that he had both helped to build and understood like the back of his own hand.
<P>Much to my surprise, David was very excited about the product ideas 
and asked if I could send him evaluation copies of our products. I did, and 
we started a long e-mail conversation about our products and ideas for 
improvements. David gave his time, expertise, and great opinions freely, without ever asking for any compensation&#151;he genuinely wanted to help us make products for the Visual C++ developer that would make MFC/Visual C++ better.
<P>I first heard about David's fatal paragliding accident via a posting on 
a newsgroup and initially thought it was some kind of cruel hoax. I called 
David's agent, who checked into the story, and much to my shock it was 
true. With David's passing, the Visual C++ community has lost one of its 
brightest and most giving stars. Talk to any Visual 
C++ developers about how they first learned Visual 
C++ and invariably they will say, &quot;the Kruglinski book!&quot; 
The Visual C++ community owes David greatly for what he gave us and taught 
us about Visual C++ over the years. It goes without saying that he should 
receive special acknowledgment for this book, and our thoughts go out to 
his family and friends for their loss.
<P>It is a great honor to carry on the Kruglinski tradition with this fifth 
edition of <I>Inside Visual C++</I> (now called 
<I>Programming Microsoft Visual C++, Fifth 
Edition</I>). We have done our best to stay true to David's vision of this 
book, following his format and style as closely as possible.
<P>Thanks to my wife Kris and to my son, Sean, for putting up with all 
of the late nights and weekends of writing. Many thanks also go to my 
coauthor, George Shepherd, who always helps me get motivated for a late night of 
book writing with his upbeat, wacky, and great personality. Thanks to Claire 
Horne, our agent, for helping us get on board with the project.
<P>Visual C++, and therefore this book, wouldn't exist if not for the 
many members of the Visual C++ team. Special thanks to Mike Blaszczak, 
Walter Sullivan, Dean McCrory, Rick Laplante, Marie Huwe, Christian Gross, and 
Jim Springfield for all of the help they have provided over the years.
<P>Finally, but not least, thanks to the folks at Microsoft Press who 
worked on this project&#151;especially Kathleen Atkins, Jim Fuchs, Becka McKay, 
John Pierce, Jean Ross, Eric Stroo, and the entire production team who 
worked extremely hard to get this large book out and into your hands with the 
highest quality possible.

<P>Much work goes into writing books&#151;even revisions of existing work. I'd 
like to acknowledge the following people for helping me get this work out the 
door: First I'd like to thank my wife Sandy for sticking with me while I worked to 
get the pages and chapters out. Sandy has been an invaluable source of 
encouragement throughout my software endeavors. Thanks to my son, Teddy, for 
being patient with me as I bowed out on various activities every once in a while. I 
wish to thank my mother Betsy for engendering in me a desire to write and my 
twin brother Patrick for being a great Java foil for me&#151;and for arguing cogently 
with me about various hardware and software platform issues.
<P>Thanks to Claire Horne of the Moore Literary Agency for helping to 
get this project rolling with Microsoft Press.
<P>To Scot Wingo, thanks for taking on another writing project with me. 
And thanks to the folks at Stingray&#151;you all are a great bunch to work with. 
Thanks to all the folks at DevelopMentor for providing a great training and 
learning environment. And thanks to Don Box for continuing to explain COM in a 
way that makes sense.
<P>Getting a book out involves more than just authors. I wish to thank 
everyone at Microsoft Press who helped kick <I>Programming Microsoft Visual 
C++, 
Fifth Edition</I> out the door, especially Eric Stroo for his kindness and 
patience, Kathleen Atkins and Becka McKay for sifting through our text and making 
it ever more readable, Jean Ross for balancing out the technical review to 
catch even the most minute error, and John Pierce for keeping everything on track.
<P>Finally, thanks to David Kruglinski for starting this project. While I 
never had the opportunity to meet David, his writing had a measuable impact on 
me when first learning MFC. I hope Scot and I did justice to the work you began.
<P>&#151;<I>George Shepherd</I>

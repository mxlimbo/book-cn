<A NAME="921"><H1>Programming the Microsoft Internet Information Server</H1></A><P>In <A HREF="ch34a.htm">Chapter 34</A>, you used a &quot;homemade&quot; Web based on the Winsock APIs. 
In this chapter, you'll learn how to use and extend Microsoft Internet 
Information Server (IIS) 4.0, which is bundled with Microsoft Windows NT Server 
4.0. IIS is actually three separate servers&#151;one for 
HTTP (for the World Wide Web), one for FTP, and one for gopher. This chapter tells you how to write 
HTTP server extensions using the Microsoft IIS application programming 
interface (ISAPI) that is part of Microsoft ActiveX technology. You'll examine two 
kinds of extensions: an ISAPI server extension and an ISAPI filter, both of which 
are DLLs. An <U>ISAPI</U> <U>server</U> 
<U>extension</U> can perform Internet business 
transactions such as order entry. An <U>ISAPI</U> 
<U>filter</U> intercepts data traveling to and from 
the server and thus can perform specialized logging and other tasks.

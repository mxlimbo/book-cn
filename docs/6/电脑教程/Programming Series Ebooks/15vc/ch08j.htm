<A NAME="188"><H1>The EX08C Example&#151;A Complete Dual-Window Web Browser</H1></A>
<P>I deliberately kept the EX08B example simple to clearly illustrate the use of the Web Browser control. However, I couldn't resist upgrading the program so that I could use it as my primary Internet browser. The result is EX08C, which uses MFC features described in later chapters of this book&#151;in particular the features below.
<UL>
<LI>A splitter window with moveable vertical bar browser windows
<LI>Use of the Registry to &quot;remember&quot; the search and target pages
<LI>Printing of both search and target pages
<LI>Support for multiple search engines
<LI>Toolbar buttons for navigation, printing, and search engine selection
<LI>Status bar display of activity and the selected URL
</UL>
<P>If EX08B runs, \vcpp32\Debug\ex08c should run also. I'm sure you'll have your own ideas for further customization. Once you've studied the rest of the book, you'll be able to take control of this project from the CD-ROM.

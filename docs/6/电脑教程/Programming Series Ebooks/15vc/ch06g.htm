<A NAME="143"><H1>Identifying Controls: <I>CWnd</I> Pointers and Control IDs</H1></A>
<P>When you lay out a dialog resource in the dialog editor, you identify each 
control by an ID such as <I>IDC<B>_</B>SSN</I>. In your program code, however, you often need access to a control's underlying window object. The MFC library provides the <I>CWnd::GetDlgItem</I> function for converting an ID to a 
<I>CWnd</I> pointer. You've seen this already in the <I>OnInitDialog</I> member function of class <I>CEx06aDialog</I>. The application framework &quot;manufactured&quot; this returned <I>CWnd</I> pointer because there never was a constructor call for the control objects. This pointer is temporary and should not be stored for later use.<P>

If you need to convert a <I>CWnd</I> pointer to a control ID, use the MFC library <I>GetDlgCtrlID</I> member function of class<I>CWnd.</I>

<A NAME="157"><H1>The Modeless Dialog and Windows Common Dialogs</H1></A><P>In <A HREF="ch06a.htm">Chapter 6</A>, you saw the ordinary modal dialog and most of the controls 
for Microsoft Windows. Now you'll move on to the modeless dialog and to 
the common dialogs for Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows NT 
versions 4.0 and later. Modeless dialogs, as you'll remember, allow the user to 
work elsewhere in the application while the dialog is active. The common dialog 
classes are the C++ programming interface to the group of Windows utility dialogs 
that include File Open, Page Setup, Color, and so forth and that are supported 
by the dynamic link library COMDLG32.DLL.
<P>In this chapter's first example, you'll build a simple modeless dialog 
that is controlled from a view. In the second example, you'll derive from 
the COMDLG32 <I>CFileDialog</I> class a class that allows file deletion.

<A NAME="1000"><H1>MFC Library Runtime Class Identification and Dynamic Object Creation</H1></A><P>Long before runtime type information (RTTI) was added to the 
C++ language specification, the MFC library designers realized that they needed runtime 
access to an object's class name and to the position of the class in the 
hierarchy. Also, the document-view architecture (and, later, COM class factories) 
demanded that objects be constructed from a class specified at runtime. So 
the MFC team created an integrated macro-based class identification and 
dynamic creation system that depends on the universal 
<I>CObject</I> base class. And in spite of the fact that the Visual 
C++ version 6.0 compiler supports the ANSI RTTI syntax, the MFC library continues to use the original system, which actually 

has more features.
<P>This appendix explains how the MFC library implements the class 
identification and dynamic creation features. You'll see how the 
<I>DECLARE_DYNAMIC</I>, <I>DECLARE_DYNCREATE</I>, and associated macros work, and you'll 
learn about the <I>RUNTIME_CLASS</I> macro and the 
<I>CRuntimeClass</I> structure.

<P>Structured storage has a dark side. Like the disk drive itself, compound files can become fragmented with frequent use. If a disk drive becomes fragmented, however, you still have the same amount of free space. With a compound file, space from deleted elements isn't always recovered. This means that compound files can keep growing even if you delete data.

<P>Fortunately, there is a way to recover unused space in a compound file. You simply create a new file and copy the contents. The <I>IStorage::CopyTo</I> function can do the whole job in one call if you use it to copy the root storage. You can either write a stand-alone utility or build a file regeneration capability into your application.

<A NAME="795"><H1><B>DAO Table-Type Recordsets</B></H1></A>
<p>DAO introduces a new type of recordset unknown in the ODBC universe. A <U>table-type</U> recordset (supported by the <I>CDaoRecordset</I> class) is a direct view of an entire database table. You can use a table-type recordset 
<U>only</U> with a table in an Access database. Table-type recordsets have the following characteristics that distinguish them from snapshots and dynasets:

<UL>
<P><LI>The <I>CDaoRecordset::GetRecordCount</I> function returns an approximate record count that reflects records added or deleted by other users.
<P><LI>You <U>can't</U> use the <I>CDaoRecordset</I> functions that access a record's absolute position or percent position.
<P><LI>The <I>CDaoRecordset::Seek</I> function lets you position to a record 
by key value. You first call the <I>CDaoRecordset::SetCurrentIndex</I> function to select the index.
<P><LI>If you add a record to a table-type recordset, the record is added in its proper place using the sort order that is determined by the current index.
</UL>

<p>The table-type recordset is a significant departure from ODBC and SQL. You can now select an individual record without first issuing a query. You can find a record with one index and then move sequentially using a different index. It's like dBASE or FoxPro programming!

<A NAME="856"><H1>To COM or Not to COM</H1></A><P>Surely you've read about ActiveX Controls for the Internet. You've 
probably encountered concepts such as composite monikers and anti-monikers, which 
are part of the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM). If you were 
overwhelmed, don't worry&#151;it's possible to program for the Internet without 
COM, and that's a good place to start. This chapter and the <A HREF="ch35a.htm">next chapter</A> are 
mostly COM-free. In <A HREF="ch36a.htm">Chapter 36</A>, you'll be writing a COM-based ActiveX 
document server, but MFC effectively hides the COM details so you can concentrate 
on Winsock and WinInet programming. It's not that ActiveX controls aren't 
important, but we can't do them justice in this book. We'll defer to 
Adam Denning's book on this subject, <I>ActiveX Controls Inside 
Out</I> (Microsoft Press, 1997). Your study of this book's COM material and Internet material will 
prepare you well for Adam's book.

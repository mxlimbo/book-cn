<A NAME="355"><H1>Two Exercises for the Reader</H1></A><P>You might have noticed the absence of a Modify button on the toolbar. 
Without such a button, you can't modify an existing student record. Can you 
add the necessary toolbar button and message handlers? The most difficult task 
might be designing a graphic for the button's tile.
<P>Recall that the <I>CStudentView</I> class is just about ready to be a 
general-purpose base class. Try separating the 
<I>CStudent</I>-specific virtual functions into a derived class. After that, make another derived class that uses a new element class other than <I>CStudent</I>.

<A NAME="600"><h1>Text and Fonts</h1></A>
<p>Displaying text was one of the first jobs we tackled in this book. Now it's time to explore the use of different fonts and font sizes available in Microsoft Windows and to learn how to justify text.

<p>The introduction of TrueType in Windows 3.1 greatly enhanced the ability of programmers and users to work with text in a flexible manner. TrueType is an outline font technology that was developed by Apple Computer, Inc., and Microsoft Corporation and is supported by many font manufacturers. Because TrueType fonts are continuously scaleable and can be used on both video displays and printers, true WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) is now possible under Windows. TrueType also lends itself well to doing &quot;fancy&quot; font manipulation, such as rotating characters, filling the interiors with patterns, or using them for clipping regions, all of which I'll demonstrate in this chapter.

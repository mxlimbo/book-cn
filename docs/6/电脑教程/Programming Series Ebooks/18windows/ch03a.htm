<A NAME="38"><h1>Windows and Messages</h1></A>
<p>In the first two chapters, the sample programs used the <I>MessageBox</I> function to deliver text output to the user. The <I>MessageBox</I> function creates a &quot;window.&quot; In Windows, the word &quot;window&quot; has a precise meaning. A window is a rectangular area on the screen that receives user input and displays output in the form of text and graphics.

<p>The <I>MessageBox</I> function creates a window, but it is a special-purpose window of limited flexibility. The message box window has a title bar with a close button, an optional icon, one or more lines of text, and up to four buttons. However, the icons and buttons must be chosen from a small collection that Windows provides for you.


<p>The <I>MessageBox</I> function is certainly useful, but we're not going to get very far with it. We can't display graphics in a message box, and we can't add a menu to a message box. For that we need to create our own windows, and now is the time.

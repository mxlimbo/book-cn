<h1>About the Author</h1>
<P>
Charles Petzold has been writing about personal computer programming since 1984 and has been programming for Microsoft Windows since 1985. He wrote the first magazine article about Windows programming in the December 1986 issue of <I>Microsoft Systems Journal</I>. Between 1986 and 1995, he wrote the Environments column for <I>PC Magazine</I>, which introduced his readers to many facets of Windows and OS/2 programming. 
<P>
<I>Programming Windows</I> was first published by Microsoft Press in 1988 and has since become regarded as the best introductory text on the subject. In May 1994, Petzold was one of only seven people (and the only writer) to be given a Windows Pioneer Award from <I>Windows Magazine</I> and Microsoft Corporation for his contribution to the success of Microsoft Windows.
<P>
In the fall of 1999, Microsoft Press will publish Charles Petzold’s first book for a general audience. Tentatively entitled <I>Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</I>, this book is a unique introduction to the nature of digital information and how computers work with that information

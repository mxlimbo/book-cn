<A NAME="473"><h1>The Device-Independent Bitmap</h1></A><P>In the last chapter, we saw how the Windows GDI bitmap object (also known as the 
device-<I>dependent</I> bitmap, or DDB) is useful for a variety of programming chores. 
However, I did not demonstrate how to save these bitmaps to disk files or load them back 
into memory. This is something that was done back in the old days of Windows but is 
never done today. The DDB is inadequate for the purpose of image interchange because 
the format of the bitmap bits is highly device-dependent. There is no color table in a DDB 
that specifies a correspondence between the bitmap bits and color. The DDB makes sense 
only when it is created and destroyed within the lifetime of a Windows session.
<P>The device-independent bitmap (or DIB) was introduced in Windows 3.0 to 
provide a sorely needed image file format suitable for interchange. As you may know, other 
image file formats, such as .GIF or .JPEG, are much more common than DIB files on the 
Internet. This is mostly because the .GIF and .JPEG formats implement compression 
schemes that significantly reduce downloading time. Although there is a compression scheme 
defined for DIBs, it is rarely used. The bitmap bits in most DIBs are almost always 
uncompressed. This is actually a major advantage if you want to manipulate the bitmap bits 
in your program. Unlike .GIF and .JPEG files, the DIB is directly supported by the 
Windows API. If you have a DIB in memory, you can supply pointers to that DIB as arguments 
to several functions that let you display the DIB or convert it into a DDB.

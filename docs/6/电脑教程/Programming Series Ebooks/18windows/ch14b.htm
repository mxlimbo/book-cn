<A NAME="427"><h1>Bitmap Basics</h1></A><P>Both bitmaps and metafiles have their place in computer graphics. Bitmaps are often 
used for very complex images originating in the real world, such as digitized photographs 
or video captures. Metafiles are more suitable for human-generated or 
machine-generated images, such as architectural drawings. Both bitmaps and metafiles can exist in 
memory or be stored on a disk as files, and both can be transferred among Windows 
applications through the clipboard.
<P>The difference between bitmaps and metafiles is the difference between raster 
graphics and vector graphics. Raster graphics treats output devices in terms of discrete 
pixels; vector graphics treats the output device as a Cartesian coordinate system upon which 
lines and filled objects can be drawn. Most graphics output devices these days are raster 
devices. These include video displays, dot-matrix printers, laser printers, and ink-jet printers. A 
pen plotter, however, is a vector output device.
<P>Bitmaps have two major drawbacks. First, they are susceptible to problems 
involving device dependence. The most obvious device dependency is color. Displaying a 
color bitmap on a monochrome device is often unsatisfactory. Another problem is that a 
bitmap often implies a particular resolution and aspect ratio of an image. Although bitmaps 
can be stretched or compressed, this process generally involves duplicating or dropping 
rows or columns of pixels, and this can lead to distortion in the scaled image. A metafile 
can be scaled to almost any size without distortion.
<P>The second major drawback of bitmaps is that they require a large amount of 
storage space. For instance, a bitmap representation of an entire 640-by-480-pixel, 16-color 
Video Graphics Array (VGA) screen requires more than 150 KB; a 1024-by-768 image with 24 
bits per pixel requires more than 2 MB. Metafiles usually require much less storage space 
than bitmaps. The storage space for a bitmap is governed by the size of the image and 
number of colors it contains, whereas the storage space for a metafile is governed by the 
complexity of the image and the number of individual GDI instructions it contains.
<P>One advantage of bitmaps over metafiles, however, is speed. Copying a bitmap to 
a video display is usually much faster than rendering a metafile. In recent years, 
compression techniques have allowed the shrinking of bitmaps to a size where they can be 
effectively transmitted over telephone lines and used extensively in World Wide Web pages 
on the Internet.

<A NAME="428"><h3>Where Do Bitmaps Come From?</h3></A><P>Bitmap images can be created &quot;manually,&quot; for example, by using the Paint program 
included with Windows 98. Someone using a raster &quot;paint&quot; program rather than a vector 
&quot;draw&quot; program is working under the assumption that the eventual image will be too complex 
to be rendered with lines and filled areas.
<P>Bitmap images can also be created algorithmically by computer code. Although 
most algorithmically generated images can be stored in a vector graphics metafile, highly 
detailed surfaces or fractals usually require bitmaps.
<P>These days, bitmaps are often used for images from the real world, and 
various hardware devices let you move images from the real world into the computer. This 
hardware generally uses something called a <I>charge-coupled 
device</I> (CCD), which releases an electrical charge when exposed to light. Sometimes these CCD cells are arranged in an 
array, one CCD per pixel; to keep costs down, a single row of CCDs can be used to scan an image.
<P>The <I>scanner</I> is the oldest of these computer-based CCD devices. It uses a row of 
CCDs that sweep along the surface of a printed image, such as a photograph. The CCDs 
generate electrical charges based on the intensity of light. Analog-to-digital converters 
(ADCs) convert the charges into numbers, which then can be arranged in a bitmap.
<P>Video camcorders also use arrays of CCD cells to capture images. Generally 
these images are recorded on videotape. However, the video output can be fed directly into 
a video <I>frame grabber</I>, which converts an analog video signal into an array of pixel 
values. These frame grabbers can be used with any compatible video source, such as that from 
a VCR or a laserdisc or DVD player, or even directly from a cable decoding box.
<P>Most recently, digital cameras have become financially viable for the home user. 
These often look very much like normal cameras. But instead of film, an array of CCDs is 
used to capture an image, and an internal ADC allows the digital image to be stored directly 
in memory within the camera. Generally, the camera interfaces to the computer through 
the serial port.

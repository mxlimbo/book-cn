<A NAME="736"><h1>Dynamic-Link Libraries</h1></A><P>Dynamic-link libraries (also called DLLs, dynamic libraries, &quot;dynalink&quot; libraries, or 
library modules) are one of the most important structural elements of Microsoft Windows. Most of the 
disk files associated with Windows are either program modules or dynamic-link library 
modules. So far we've been writing Windows programs; now it's time to take a stab at 

writing dynamic-link libraries. Many of the principles you've learned in writing programs are 
also applicable to writing these libraries, but there are some important differences.

<A NAME="299"><h1>The CmnHdr.h Header File</h1></A>
<p>All the sample programs include the CmnHdr.h header file before any other header file. I wrote CmnHdr.h, shown in Listing A-1 at the end of this appendix, to make my life a little easier. The file contains macros, linker directives, and other code that is common across all the sample applications. When I want to try something different, all I do is modify CmnHdr.h and rebuild all the sample applications. CmnHdr.h is in the root directory on the companion CD.</p>

<p>The remainder of this appendix discusses each section of the CmnHdr.h header file. I'll explain the rationale for each section and describe how and why you might want to make changes before rebuilding the sample applications.</p>

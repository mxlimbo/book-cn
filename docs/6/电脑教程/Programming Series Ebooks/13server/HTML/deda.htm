<p>To Kristin,<br>
Nothing means more to me than our journey together. Your support and lovis are the most valuable gifts you share with me. Thanks for accompanying me on my sky car as we head for the highest GPS satellites orbiting above. Nessum will stand between us.<br>

<p>Dearest Annette,<br>
Thank you for filling in the spaces and keeping me
well rounded, refreshed, encouraged, and happy
while undertaking this enormous task. 
Thank you for giving me your understanding,
your flexibility, your help, and most of all,
thank you for giving me your love.
Because of you, I feel complete,<br>
&#8212;Jason</p>

<A NAME="3"><h1>The Discipline of Service Development</h1></A>

<p>We all agree that good programming requires a great deal of talent. 
Implementing proper error checking, anticipating the resources available on a 
system, predicting all the potential inputs from various users&#8212;this is the work that 
makes programming an art form. Writing services requires total mastery of this art form.</p>


<p>Neglecting to handle every nuance is not catastrophic for application 
software; failures usually affect a single user, not the entire enterprise. But 
<i>server </i>software <i>is </i>mission critical and therefore requires strict attention to all 
details. The disciplined developer of servers writes code to address these details. 
The following sections describe some of the disciplines that a server designer 
must pay strict attention to.</p>


<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>Throughout this book, I frequently use the terms &quot;server&quot; and 
&quot;service.&quot; When I use the term &quot;server,&quot; I am referring to a machine or an 
application that performs duties for a client. When I use the term 
&quot;service,&quot; I am referring to a special Microsoft Windows application that 
performs duties for a client but also contains additional infrastructure that 
enables it to receive special treatment by the operating system. 
These terms obviously overlap, and I sometime use them interchangeably, but if I 
am specifically discussing a Windows service, I will use the term &quot;service.&quot;</blockquote>

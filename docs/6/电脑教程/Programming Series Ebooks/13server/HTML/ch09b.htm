<A NAME="172"><h1>What Is a Trustee?</h1></A>
<p>When you log on to a machine running Windows, you typically type in your username and a password. This username identifies an account that represents you to the system. Accounts such as this are generally referred to as <i>user accounts</i>.</p>

<p>User accounts maintain a set of information about a user, such as name, password (or credentials), comments, and address. Two critical items stored with a user account are a list of the user's privileges on the system and a digital identity&#8212;referred to as a security identifier, or SID (pronounced &quot;sid&quot;)&#8212;that the system uses to identify the account when securing objects and private data. A SID is a variable-length binary structure that identifies a trustee account. (Privileges and SIDs will be discussed in detail later in this chapter.) A third and similarly important piece of information associated with a user account is a list of groups of which the user is a member.</p>

<p>The developers of Windows implemented group accounts in an effort to manage complexity. A <i>group account</i> contains a set of members that can be user accounts or global group accounts. A group account maintains similar information to a user account, such as system privileges and a SID. By simply assigning the user accounts to a group account, the security for a set of users can be managed in one place without having to make adjustments for each user.</p>

<p>User accounts and group accounts are trustees of a system. A <i>trustee</i> is an entity to which access can be denied or allowed in Windows. Some trustees exist implicitly in the system (such as the built-in group Everyone), others are created dynamically by the system (such as the logon SID discussed in more detail in <a href="ch10a.htm">Chapters 10</a> and <a href="ch11a.htm">11</a>), and still other trustees exist because accounts have been created for them. Users, groups, and computers are all trustees of Windows that have associated <i>trustee accounts</i>. All trustees share common functionality throughout the system, especially when dealing with access control (which is covered in the <a href="ch10a.htm">next chapter</a>).</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
User accounts and group accounts are members of a broader category called <i>trustees</i>. Because we are dealing primarily with user and group accounts in this chapter, unless otherwise specified, the terms <i>trustee</i> and <i>trustee account</i> are used to represent user and group accounts.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>When access or ownership to a file or some other system object is granted by the system, it is granted via a trustee account. When a privileged function is performed by the system, it is allowed because the privilege was granted to a trustee account. When a user is identified to the system, the user is identified by his or her trustee account and by the trustee accounts of the groups of which the user is a member. So as you can see, the trustee account is a key part of Windows security.</p>

<p>Before we jump into our discussion on programmatically administering user and group accounts, let's take a moment to look at the user interface for administering trustees of the system.</p>

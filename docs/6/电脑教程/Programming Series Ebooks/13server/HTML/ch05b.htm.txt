<A NAME="73"><h1>The System Registry Structure</h1></A>
<p>The registry is a limited, shared system resource. With it come some rules of etiquette (or convention) as well as some rules that are strictly enforced by the system. Before we go on, I want to briefly cover the structure of the registry in more detail.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, the system registry is laid out in a hierarchy consisting of keys and values. Keys can contain an arbitrary number of keys (orÁàèubkeys) and values. Subkeys are equal citizens and can contain an arbitrary number of subkeys and values of their own. Key names must be unique among their siblings and cannot contain a backslash. Figure 5-1 shows the registry's structure.</p>

<p>The registry has a logical structure and a physical structure. Programmers usually concern themselves only with the logical structure. Logically, the registry contains a number of root keys similar to how drive A: and drive C: are considered root directories. A registry's root keys identify the tops of registry trees.</p>

<p>Physically, however, the registry is maintained in multiple files, called hives, on the user's hard drive. Programmers need only to think about the path to a key in the registry. Internally, the operating system determines which hive contains this key, and the system accesses the proper file.</p>

<A NAME="298"><h1>Appendix A -- The Build Environment</h1></A>
<p>To build the sample applications in this book, you must deal with compiler and linker switch settings. I tried to isolate these setting details from the sample applications by placing almost all of them in a single header file named CmnHdr.h. It is included in all the sample application source code files.</p>

<p>Since I wasn't able to place all the settings in CmnHdr.h, I made some changes to each sample application's project settings in the Project Settings dialog box:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>On the General tab, I set the Output Files directory so that all final .exe and .dll files go to a single directory.</li></p>

<p><li>On the C/C++ tab, I selected the Code Generation category and selected Multithreaded DLL for the Use Run-Time Library field.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>That's it. These are the only settings that I explicitly changed; I accepted the default settings for everything else. Note that I made the two changes for both the debug and release builds of each project. I was able to set all other compiler and linker settings in the source code, so these settings will be in effect if you use any of my source code modules in your projects.</p>

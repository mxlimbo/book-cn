<A NAME="74"><h1>Registry Conventions</h1></A>
<p>This section discusses conventions for registry usage, focusing on the portions specifically applicable to server software designed for Windows.</p>

<p>The integrity of the registry is maintained through the marriage of system-enforced rules and convention. Convention keeps the registry from becoming a general-purpose database engine for a piece of software, and also helps avoid undue clutter and traffic in this shared system resource.</p>

<p>The first decision you should make regarding storing configuration information for your software is whether the information applies to the machine (or all users) or to a specific user of the system. Said another way, if the information maps to a feature of your software, do you want the feature's configuration to be the same regardless of the user involved, or do you want the information to be configured differently for each user?</p>

<p>In the typical case, information stored in the registry when software is installed applies to all users of the system. This process is much like hardware being installed on the system. In contrast, user settings and configuration changes made at software run time are commonly stored for a specific user.</p>

<P>The Helpdesk Reporting solution is a mixture of HTML and ASP pages. To run 
this solution, you must open the Default.htm page using an http:// URL, meaning that 
you cannot simply double-click the files on the companion CD. The easiest way to 
set up the solution is to follow these steps:</P>

<OL>
<P><LI>If you are using a Microsoft Windows NT Server machine with 
Microsoft Internet Information Server, use the IIS manager to add a virtual 
directory to your root web. Copy the Chap06 and Scripts directories on the 
companion CD to your machine's hard drive and specify these directories 
as the sources for peer virtual directories. Make sure you enable scripting 
support, and make sure you have designated the Chap06 folder as an 
application by choosing the Create button in the Application Settings 
section of the Folder Properties dialog box.</LI></P>

<P><LI>If you are running Personal Web 
Server (say on Windows 98 or Windows NT 
Workstation), use the Personal Web Manager to add a virtual 
directory as described in Step 1, but make sure that you check 
the Execute option in the Access section of the Add Directory dialog box.</LI></P>

<P><LI>Type the URL for the directory into your browser&#8212;for example, 
<I>http://MyServer/Chap06</I>. The Default.htm page should load unless 
you have configured your web site to use another default filename. If you 
have, simply type /<I>Default.htm</I> at the end of the URL.</LI></P>
</OL>


<P>Note that this solution does have a Global.asa file. If you do not set up 
the directory as a web application, the Global.asa file will never be invoked. If you 
forget to designate the directory as an application, you'll notice a large number of 
temporary files generated in the directory. That's because the Global.asa file is set up 
to delete the temporary GIF images produced by the server-side chart example 
when the session times out. If no application is defined, no session timeout occurs and 
the Global.asa file is never called.</p>

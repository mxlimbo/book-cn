<P>Microsoft Office 2000 includes a new set of controls called the Office Web 
Components (OWC). Using these components, you can build many useful data 
analysis and reporting solutions, both in the web browser and in traditional 
programming environments. In this chapter, I will explain why the Office Web Components 
were created, what they are, and where you can use them. I will also give you a few 
initial ideas for their use in business solutions. Part II of the book will provide 
some common, practical uses of the components and will take you on a step-by-step 
tour of the techniques used in those solutions.</P>

<P>If you don't know anything about these controls, read on, as this chapter 
will serve as the foundation for the rest of the book. If you are already familiar with 
the components and just want to see how to use them in business solutions, skip 
ahead to <A HREF="ch06a.htm">Chapter 6</A>.</P>

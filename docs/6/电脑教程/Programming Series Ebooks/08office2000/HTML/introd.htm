<P>The companion CD for this book contains numerous code samples, as well as 
the complete source code to all the solutions discussed in Part II. I highly encourage 
you to examine and run these samples and solutions while you read the chapters, as 
this will help illustrate the concepts you are learning. Feel free to reuse the sample 
code in your own applications.</P>
<P>To run the code samples from Part I, browse the files on the companion 
CD and double-click them. These files were designed to run directly from the CD, so 
they use relative paths for finding databases and style sheets. If you copy the CD 
folders to your hard disk, make sure to copy all the folders and keep them in the same 
relative locations. This will happen automatically if you run the Setup program on the CD.</P>
<P>Most of the solutions in Part II require a web server capable of executing 
ASP scripts. Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) and Microsoft Personal Web 
Server are both capable of executing ASP scripts, so you can use either product. 
Determining how to install these products can be challenging, so refer to the 
following table to ascertain the appropriate place from which to install them given 
your operating system.</P>

<P>Enabling rich, web-based data analysis and reporting systems was one of our 
team's key goals when we designed the Microsoft Office Web Components. In this 
chapter, I will describe my implementation of such a system and show you how to 
combine a number of the techniques presented in Part I to build a sales analysis and 
reporting system for your company. Although the solution in this chapter focuses on 
sales information, the techniques used here are applicable to any type of data.</P>

<P>This chapter showed you how to build a solution that displays business metrics 
using server-generated charts, interactive client-side charts, and real-time data 
charts. The basic techniques illustrated in this chapter apply to a vast array of solutions 
involving the Chart component, and we will see some of these same techniques 
used in later chapters.</P>
 
<p><A HREF="ch07a.htm">Chapter 7</A> involves both the Chart control and the PivotTable control. The 
solution presented in that chapter is a sales 
analysis and reporting system that uses OLAP 
(multidimensional) and tabular data sources&#8212;which is, along with charting 
business metrics, one of the main scenarios for using the Office Web Components.</p>

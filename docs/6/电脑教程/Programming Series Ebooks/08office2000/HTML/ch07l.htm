<P>Although the source code in this solution is quite long, it merely scratches the 
surface of what you can do in a sales analysis and reporting system. The 
combination of the Chart and PivotTable components provides a powerful analysis surface, 
and the ability to save and reload reports gives the user the power to create custom 
slices of data and recall them later. </P>

<P>You can implement a number of other ideas in this kind of system. For 
example, you can offer standard reports that are built on the server and returned as GIF 
images. You can also use more advanced MDX functions to filter for members with sales 
that were 10 percent greater than or less than they were during the same period the 
year before. And you can enable users to double-click an aggregate value and drill 
through to a transactional system, viewing the detailed invoices that comprise the aggregate. </P>

<P>This chapter focused on decision support systems and OLAP data 
sources. <A HREF="ch08a.htm">Chapter 8</A> will show you how to use the Office Web Components in a 
ubiquitous transactional system: timesheet tracking.</P>

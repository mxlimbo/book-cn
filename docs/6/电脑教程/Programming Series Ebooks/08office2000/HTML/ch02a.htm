<A NAME="15"><H1>The Spreadsheet Component</H1></A>

<P>This chapter will delve into the functionality and the programming model of 
the Microsoft Office Spreadsheet component. Since this book focuses on building 
real solutions, I'll present a few interesting uses of each component feature along with 
its description. In Part II of the book, you'll see many of these ideas actually implemented.</P>
<P>This chapter will give you an understanding of what the Spreadsheet 
component can and cannot do, suggest clever ways you can use your own code to 
add functionality to the component, and show the key elements of the programming 
model that will get you started.</P>

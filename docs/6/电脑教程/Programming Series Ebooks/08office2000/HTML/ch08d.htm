<p>The Timesheet solution is a mixture of HTML and ASP. To 
run this solution, you must open the Default.htm page using an http:// URL, 
meaning that you cannot simply double-click the files on the companion CD. The easiest way to set up this 
solution is to follow these steps:</p>

<OL>

<p><LI>If you are using a Windows NT Server machine with Microsoft Internet 
Information Server, use the IIS manager to add a virtual directory to your 
root web. Copy the Chap08 directory on the companion CD to your 
machine's hard drive, and specify that directory as the source for a virtual 
directory. Make sure to enable scripting support.</li></p>

<p><LI>If you are running Personal Web Server (say on Windows 98 or 
Windows NT Workstation), use the Personal Web Manager to add a virtual 
directory as described in Step 1.</li></p>

<p><LI>Type the URL for the directory into your browser (for example, 
<I>http://MyServer/Chap08</I>). The Default.asp page should load unless you 
have configured your web site to use some other default filename. If you 
have, simply add <I>/Default.asp</I> to the end of the URL.</li></p>
</OL>

<p>For tips on how to create virtual directories for ASP applications under 
Personal Web Server, see the sidebar in the section &quot;<A HREF="ch06e.htm#145">Creating Server-Side Charts on Demand</A>&quot; of Chapter 6. Note that this solution 
does not use a Global.asa file and therefore does not need to be set up as an application.</p>

<p>The ASP scripts in this solution will use the LOGON_USER server variable 
for the current user name when saving reports. By default, IIS leaves the &quot;Allow 
Anonymous Access&quot; authentication method on and when it is enabled, LOGON_USER 
returns a blank string. If you want to enable the solution to save reports based on 
the actual user name, disable anonymous access by editing the virtual directory's 
security settings.</p>

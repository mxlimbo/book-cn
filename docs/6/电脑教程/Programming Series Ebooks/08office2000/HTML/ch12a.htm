<P>Now that you know how to build complex business solutions involving the 
Microsoft Office Web Components, the last topic I want to discuss is how to deploy the 
components to the people using your solutions. Although the Office Web 
Components are COM controls, the way you deploy them and the manner in which they 
are installed is slightly different than for most COM controls. This chapter will 
explain your options for deployment, give you step-by-step instructions on how to 
configure a page to automatically download and install the components, show you 
how to detect whether the components are already installed, and provide you with 
a complete list of files required by the Office Web Components and Microsoft 
Data Access Components (MDAC) version 2.1.</P>

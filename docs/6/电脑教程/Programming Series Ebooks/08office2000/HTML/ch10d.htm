<P>This solution requires no explicit setup. You can run this solution directly from 
the companion CD by opening the Default.htm file in the Chap10 folder. To install 
this solution on a web server, copy the Default.htm and Ticker.cab files from the 
Chap10 folder to your web site.</P>

<P>The first time you run the solution, you might see a prompt asking you 
to confirm the installation of the Ticker.cab file, which contains the StockTicker.ocx 
file. You might also receive a prompt to install the WinInet control, which is used by 
the Stock Ticker control to access web sites. Both of the controls should 
automatically install and initialize if you give your approval. If you do not allow the 
installation, the solution will not function. Note that if you run the files directly from your 
file system, you will not see a prompt because that scenario is considered safe by 
Internet Explorer, meaning a page can load and install any content without warning.</P>

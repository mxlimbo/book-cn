<P>During the last few years, OLAP and data warehousing technology have 
exploded in popularity and practicality. OLAP has been around for quite some time, but it 
did not achieve a critical mass in the business world until recently. Today, you can 
hardly pick up a computer or information systems trade journal that does not mention 
OLAP or data warehousing. (For those of you not familiar with OLAP, see &quot;<A HREF="ch04c.htm#92">A Brief Overview of OLAP</A>.&quot;)</P>

<P>In many ways, the OLAP explosion is not a surprise. During the last four 
decades, corporations have become extremely adept at capturing large amounts of 
transactional and research data in order to run their core business systems and develop new 
products. Once that information has been captured, it's a valuable resource just 
waiting to be tapped&#8212;most businesspeople want to see summaries to help them make 
decisions about marketing campaigns, sales efforts, production processes, and so on. 
Unfortunately for the business decision makers in these corporations, this resource often 
is locked safely in that impenetrable vault known as the centralized IT department. 
The IT employees have their hands full keeping the core business systems running 
and usually do not have the time to generate the myriad desired reports, the requests 
for which are often vaguely phrased and poorly defined. If and when the IT 
department <I>does </I>produce these reports, the reports tend to be inflexible. In fact, requesting 
a simple change such as grouping data by a different field might require the IT 
department to generate a new report&#8212;unfortunately, with a painfully slow turnaround.</P>

<P>OLAP and data warehousing promise to alleviate some of these problems 
by letting IT groups concentrate on what they do best and by putting simple yet 
powerful tools in the hands of those with questions about the data, enabling them to 
generate any slice of data needed. The IT group can spend its time extracting, 
consolidating, and cleaning the data; designing a cube structure that matches the business's 
mental model; and developing batch programs to load daily transactional data into the 
OLAP servers. Users can &quot;slice and dice&quot; to find answers to their particular 
questions&#8212;for instance, &quot;How much did we sell per capita for each state in my region?&quot; or, &quot;How 
much have the sales of my product increased or decreased compared to this time last year?&quot;</P>

<P>The PivotTable component is one of those simple yet powerful client tools 
often categorized as &quot;business intelligence&quot; tools. While those who read the comic 
strip Dilbert on a regular basis might consider &quot;business intelligence&quot; an oxymoron, it's 
a good description of what these tools aim to deliver. The mass of data stored in 
an OLAP system is useless until it is translated into information presented in a 
report, which hopefully becomes useful knowledge to someone making a business 
decision. You can use the PivotTable component to build powerful, web-based data 
analysis systems that allow your users to sort, filter, and regroup data within the web 
browser. Many corporations are discovering that web browsers and intranet sites provide 
an easy way to convey information to employees. However, static representations of 
data are as limiting as those obsolete printed reports. Not only does the PivotTable 
control deliver interactive data analysis, but it also offers easy installation and upgrading. 
Much of the ease of deployment can be attributed to Microsoft Internet Explorer's 
automatic code download mechanism, which is used for all COM components on a web 
page. (We'll discuss deployment in greater detail in <A HREF="ch12a.htm">Chapter 12</A>.)</P>


<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>
Despite all this talk of HTML and web pages, you should realize 
that the PivotTable control runs in Microsoft Visual Basic forms and the other 
control containers listed in <A HREF="ch01a.htm">Chapter 1</A> as well as it runs in web pages. However, most 
of the discussions in this chapter focus on using the PivotTable control on a 
web page simply because many developers find this immensely appealing.
</blockquote></div></p>


<P>This chapter will discuss the conceptual details of the PivotTable 
component, starting with an explanation of why a PivotTable report is useful. Next, you will 
see the various types of data that the PivotTable control can consume. Plus, you'll get 
a brief overview of OLAP technology, one of the key data sources for the 
PivotTable component. After that, you will learn about the terminology of the elements in 
the PivotTable control and see how they map to the underlying elements in each 
type of data source. Finally, you'll discover how to use the PivotTable control to 
add analysis features to your solution.</P>

<P>This chapter will not explicitly cover creating a PivotTable interactively in a 
designer. The PivotTable control's help file covers this topic quite thoroughly; you 
can view it by clicking the control's Help toolbar button. For information on 
publishing Microsoft Excel 2000 PivotTable reports to the PivotTable control, see the Excel 
help topic entitled, &quot;About displaying Microsoft Excel PivotTable reports on the Web.&quot;</P>

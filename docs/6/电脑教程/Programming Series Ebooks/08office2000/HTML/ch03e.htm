<p>Although the Chart component might look rather simple on the surface, there is 
quite a bit of complexity hiding in it. We've covered much of the functionality of the 
Chart control in this chapter. However, you'll find more information on using the Chart 
component in Part II of this book where I discuss several solutions you can build 
using it. Also, spend some time looking at this chapter's example files on the 
companion CD as they will help you get started writing code against the Chart control.</p>

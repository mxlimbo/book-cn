<A NAME="2"><H1>Dave  Stearns</H1></A>

<P>Dave Stearns started his career as a software developer in Microsoft's Information 
Technology group, building internal systems. 
Coincidentally (or maybe ironically), his first project involved building a client/server 
sales analysis and reporting system for Microsoft Press using Microsoft SQL Server 1.1 
and Microsoft OS/2 (when it was still 
<I>Microsoft</I> OS/2) on the server and PowerBuilder 
1.0 on the client (Windows 3.0). Dave eventually became a development lead in the 
IT group, heading the team that built the C++-based client application for Microsoft's 
central customer and product registration database. Dave then became a program 
manager in Microsoft's Visual Basic group, 
designing the database features in the Enterprise Editions of Visual Basic 4.0 and 
5.0. After a brief stint designing the ADO programming interfaces, Dave joined 
a newly formed team in the Microsoft Office organization to help design and 
build the first version of the Office Web Components. Dave is currently working 
on the next version of the Office Web Components.</P>
<P>Dave lives in Seattle with his wonderful wife Chelle. When he's not 
working, he makes a vain attempt at playing his saxophones and other 
miscellaneous woodwinds. He aspires to one day play the only woodwind instrument 
louder than the saxophone&#8212;the bagpipes.</P>

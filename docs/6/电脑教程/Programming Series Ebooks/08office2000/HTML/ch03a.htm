<p>Now that you have an understanding of the Spreadsheet component, let's 
examine the functionality and programming model of the Chart component. As in the <a href="ch02a.htm">previous chapter</a>, after describing a given feature, I will present a few interesting uses 
for it. In Part II of the book, you will see many of these ideas actually implemented.</p>

<p>This chapter will also show you some clever ways to add functionality to 
the Chart component using your own code. The Chart component might seem a bit 
less complex than the Spreadsheet or PivotTable components at first, but it has 
some powerful features that you can use in your solutions. Plus, it offers many &quot;knobs&quot; 
that you can adjust to customize a chart to your liking.</p>

<P>When building custom solutions with the Office Web Components, you typically 
do not need to write code that directly uses the DSC. However, the DSC offers a 
number of useful techniques that you can use to enhance your solutions.</P>

<P>This is the last chapter in Part I of the book, the conceptual overview of 
the Office Web Components. Part II contains a number of useful and exciting 
solutions you can build with the Office Web Components and explains the various 
techniques used to build them. Now that you know how to perform the basic 
programming tasks with each of the controls, it's time to start putting them together and 
integrating them with other technologies to build real-world business solutions.</P>

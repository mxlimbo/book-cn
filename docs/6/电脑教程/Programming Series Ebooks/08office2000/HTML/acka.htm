<A NAME="1"><H1>Acknowledgments</H1></A>

<P>This book is not solely the product of my own work. A number of people 
contributed information, helpful tips, review comments, and even some source code. 
Although the full list of people I would like to thank is longer than this book, I do want to 
recognize the following people and their contributions to its creation.</P>
<P>My coworkers on the Office Web Components program management 
team&#8212;Jason Cahill, Mark Igra, Kent Lowry, Jay Massena, Peter Hussey, Paul Davies, 
and George Snelling&#8212;all provided volumes of information and review comments. 
Jason also developed some of the scriptlets and ancillary controls used in Part II of the book.</P>
<P>I can't thank the OWC development team enough, both for their hard work 
in creating the Office Web Components and for the constant technical and 
debugging help they provided while I developed the solutions. Amit Dekate, Andy 
Milton, David Wortendyke, Eric Matteson, Jason Allen, Jeff Couckuyt, Kevin Grealish, 
Matt Reynolds, Matt Androski, Mike Coulson, Randy Davis, Wes Cherry, Anatoly 
Grabar, Matt Bellew, Chris Brown, Will Pugh, Andrew Miller, Less Wright, and Cesar 
Alvarez made up this team, and they are by far the best developers on the face of the Earth.</P>
<P>Special thanks goes to Erik Christensen for his explanation of how 
Microsoft Visual Basic implements IPropertyNotifySink, as well as all the other great help 
he's given me over the years. Erik is the brainchild behind most of Visual Basic's 
most successful features.</P>
<P>I would also like to thank the OWC testers that assisted me in reviewing 
the chapters: Chad Foley, Dan Ricker, and our esteemed and ever-capable test 
lead Aaron Bregel.</P>
<P>Thanks also to Corey Salka, Amir Netz, Ariel Netz, Eric Jacobsen, and the 
whole SQL Server OLAP Services team for their assistance and for their permission to 
include the Foodmart sample cube on the book's companion CD. The OLAP 
Services team is one of the best at Microsoft (second to the OWC team of 
course&#8230;<img src="images/smile.jpg" width=19 height=17 alt="" border="0">).</P>
<P>Special thanks to George Snelling, Richard McAnnif, and Steve Sinofsky 
for giving me permission to work on the book. It didn't affect my job 
performance&#8212;I promise.</P>
<P>Many thanks to Jen Hoffey for taking my picture for the book.</P>
<P>Of course, many thanks have to go to Eric Stroo, Michelle Goodman, 
Linda Harmony, and Steve Perry, my editors at Microsoft Press. Without them, this 
project would certainly never have come to fruition.</P>
<P>Lastly, no amount of thanks to my wife Chelle and all my friends could 
be enough. Without their support and encouragement, I would have never 
embarked on this hefty endeavor, nor ever completed it. Luckily, my wife and friends are 
the most patient people in the universe and don't hate me for the many times I 
ignored them while finishing a chapter!</P>

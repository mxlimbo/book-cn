<P>Most businesses sell something, whether it is a physical product or a service. 
Information about these sales is commonly captured in a core business system for 
invoicing and shipping purposes; however, that information also has a critical influence 
on marketing, sales, and product development decisions. The IT groups in such 
companies are often called on to provide summary reports of sales information. 
Typically users want these reports in an electronic format so that they can perform 
further analysis or reporting. OLAP and web technologies provide an extremely 
attractive mechanism for responding to these requests.</P>

<P>The solution in this chapter is a preliminary version of a web-based sales 
analysis and reporting system. I call it a &quot;preliminary&quot; version because you will probably 
want to enable many other features in your solution. However, the techniques 
illustrated by this solution are the ones developers commonly ask me about, and they are 
often the key to knowing how to implement other features as well. This solution 
allows users to quickly analyze data stored in a multidimensional data source, save 
reports they create and reload them later, and view their data in either the PivotTable 
control or the Chart control. Users can choose to use an online OLAP server or an 
offline cube file, and they can reload reports in either case. This solution also shows 
how to implement a useful feature not built in to the first release of the PivotTable 
component: top/bottom <I>N</I> filtering.</P>

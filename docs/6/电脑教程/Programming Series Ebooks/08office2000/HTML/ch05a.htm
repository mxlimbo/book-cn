<P>The final character in the cast of the Microsoft Office Web Components is the 
Data Source component (DSC). The DSC does not get much credit because it is 
largely invisible. However, it has the difficult job of connecting to data sources, building 
and executing commands, and retrieving results. The DSC is also the workhorse 
behind Microsoft Access 2000 data access pages.</P>

<P>When building custom solutions with the other Office Web Components, 
you generally use only a small set of the DSC's functionality&#8212;so you do not need to 
know much about the DSC. However, this chapter will give you a quick overview of 
what the DSC can do, discuss how it implements security, describe an easy way to 
make it use the Microsoft Remote Data Services (RDS) provider, and conclude by 
demonstrating how to perform the most common DSC programming tasks.</P>

<P>The DSC has much more functionality than this chapter can cover. The 
functionality not discussed here involves supporting Access 2000's data access 
pages, which is beyond the scope of this book. Instead, this chapter will concentrate on 
the DSC features you will need when building custom solutions that use the other 
Office Web Components.</P>

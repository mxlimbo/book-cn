<A NAME="4"><H1>Why Were the Office Web Components Created?</H1></A>

<P>The technologies developed for the World Wide Web are taking both large and 
small businesses by storm. Companies now see the Internet and the Web as key 
mechanisms for reaching their customers and for distributing information among 
customers, suppliers, and vendors. Companies are also realizing that the same technologies 
used internally on their LANs or WANs (known as intranets) provide scalable, flexible, 
easy-to-use mechanisms for sharing information and for developing and deploying 
tools to run their businesses.</P>
<P>Not so long ago, setting up and managing content on an intranet was a 
black art relegated to &quot;webmasters.&quot; With the advent of site management and content 
creation tools such as Microsoft FrontPage, ordinary mortals could create 
web-ready documents and manage them much like they managed files on their local 
computers. Tools such as these made it possible for semitechnical individuals to set up web 
sites and share information with their coworkers.</P>
<P>Documents full of text lend themselves well to HTML and web browser 
technologies, but not all documents are useful when viewed as static text only. 
Authors who create spreadsheets, databases, and database reports encounter special 
problems and opportunities when sharing these on their corporate intranets. 
Much of the value of sharing a spreadsheet or database report lies in letting other users 
interact with it and tailor the model to their own needs. For example, if you create a 
spreadsheet to analyze a product's profitability given various input costs, an important 
aspect of sharing that spreadsheet is enabling other users to change or enter new 
assumptions and view the recalculated results. Likewise, if you create a Microsoft 
Excel PivotTable report (more commonly known as a 
<I>crosstab report</I>), allowing other people to sort, filter, group, reorganize, or drill down to more detail is an essential part 
of sharing these documents. In other words, publishing a spreadsheet or 
database document on a web is only half the story. The other half is enabling others to 
interact with the published document and garner information that's meaningful to 
them, not just to the publisher.</P>
<P>Corporate information technology (IT) groups are also realizing the benefits 
of web and Internet technologies. Many information systems are much easier to 
develop, deploy, use, and support when created with web technologies on the 
corporation's intranet. Two such classes of systems exist: 
<I>decision support systems (DSS), </I>also known as 
<I>executive information systems (EIS)</I> or the more recent name 
<I>online analytical processing (OLAP),</I> and 
<I>transactional systems,</I> which are used infrequently or by 
large audiences. The Sales Analysis and Reporting solution in <A HREF="ch07a.htm">Chapter 7</A> gives an 
example of OLAP in a web browser, and the Timesheet solution described in <A HREF="ch08a.htm">Chapter 8</A> 
shows an example of a transactional tool commonly used by a large audience.</P>
<P>Decision support systems lend themselves incredibly well to the 
technologies and user metaphors of the web. Want to know how many units of your product 
were sold last month? Open your web browser, and click a particular hyperlink. Need 
to see a list of customers in your district? Again, it's just a click away from your 
team's intranet home page. Technologies such as Common Gateway Interface (CGI) 
and Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) have made it possible for IT groups to 
deliver live reports on demand in a format that can be viewed, printed, or imported into 
a variety of analysis tools.</P>
<P>However, often the person viewing the report wants to see it in a slightly 
different way, sort it by a different value, group the data in a different order, drill 
down and see more detail about a number, or see the data organized into a chart. 
When any of these scenarios occurs, IT groups return to the same problem they have 
always had to deal with: how do they build a flexible, robust, and easy-to-use 
reporting system that satisfies everyone's needs?</P>
<P>The second class of systems&#8212;transactional systems&#8212;also benefits from the 
technologies of the web. Need to change your 401(k) contribution? Just follow a 
hyperlink on the human resources home page, enter the new value, and click the Submit 
button. Need help fixing your computer? Navigate to the helpdesk site, fill out the 
form describing your problem, and click Submit. There's no install program to run, 
no complex application to execute, and little to no client-side disk space needed.</P>
<P>Sometimes these applications demand a richer client interface, one that 
will provide gridlike data entry, recalculation, updates to charts showing the impact 
of the current value, and so on. To keep the deployment benefits, an IT group 
would need to use an active component in the page; however, they often lack the 
resources to develop such components themselves.</P>


<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<B>The Subtler Side of Buzzwords</B>
<P>To be precise, the terms &quot;decision support systems,&quot; &quot;executive 
information systems,&quot; and &quot;OLAP&quot; are not quite synonymous&#8212;each has a slant that 
makes it a little unique. The term &quot;executive information systems&quot; is hardly used 
today since information systems aren't used only by executives anymore; 
however, once upon a time the phrase described information systems that delivered 
critical, high-level business information to executives who were monitoring the 
health of the company. The term &quot;decision support systems&quot; is more 
encompassing and applies to systems that aid in decision making, often focusing on delivering 
ad hoc data analysis. &quot;OLAP&quot; is a hot buzzword today, and it's more often used 
to describe a class of technologies than the solutions built around them. Alas, 
our friends in the trade press often use all these terms interchangeably.</P>
</blockquote></div></p>


<P>So how do you deliver an interactive experience on the corporate intranet? 
How do you make a spreadsheet or database report come to life in the web browser? 
How can you develop and deploy solutions that provide rich data analysis and data 
visualization capabilities? How can you build transactional solutions with richer 
client interfaces? The answer is the Office Web Components.</P>

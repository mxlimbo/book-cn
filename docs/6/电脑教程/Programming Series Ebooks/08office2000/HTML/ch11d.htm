<P>The Custom Function Library solution is entirely based in Microsoft Visual Basic 
6. Although all the previous solutions ran in web pages, I wanted to show you in 
this last solution how to use the Microsoft Office Web Components in a Visual 
Basic application. This also makes it easy to test the function add-in DLL by stepping 
through each function as the Spreadsheet component evaluates it.</P>

<P>To run this solution, open the FuncLibTestGrp.vbg project group in 
Visual Basic 6 or a later version. The project group consists of two projects: the analysis 
function library DLL project and the function library test EXE project. If you like, you can 
set breakpoints and run the application to step through the custom functions line by line.</P>

<P>Alternatively, you can run the prebuilt executables on the companion CD 
by following these steps:</P>

<OL>
<P><LI>Copy the AnalysisFuncLib.dll file from the Chap11 folder to your hard 
disk and register it by running Regsvr32.exe, passing the DLL name as 
the command-line parameter.</LI></P>

<P><LI>Run the FuncLibTest.exe program from the Chap11\Test folder.</LI></P>

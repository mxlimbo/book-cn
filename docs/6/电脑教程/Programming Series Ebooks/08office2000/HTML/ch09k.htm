<P>This chapter demonstrated how you can use existing spreadsheet models as a 
part of your solution via the Spreadsheet component. Although the Loan 
Calculation solution used the model in the context of an ASP script, you can just as easily 
use models in Visual Basic or C++ applications that utilize the Spreadsheet 
component. For example, if your product discount model exists in a spreadsheet, you can use 
that spreadsheet in an order entry application to determine the discount rate for a 
certain customer ordering a certain quantity of product.</P>

<P>The <a href="ch10a.htm">next chapter</a> will also discuss the Spreadsheet component but will focus 
on getting real-time data into the component using its property-binding feature.</P>

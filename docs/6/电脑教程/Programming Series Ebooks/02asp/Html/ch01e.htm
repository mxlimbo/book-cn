<P>With the release of the latest version of Visual Basic, developers 
acquired another set of tools for creating dynamic content. Visual Basic 5.0 supports 
the creation of ActiveX controls as well as a new project type known as 
ActiveX documents. ActiveX documents are software objects that 
can be downloaded and run inside an ActiveX container such as Internet Explorer. 
ActiveX documents allow Visual Basic developers to immediately 
leverage their expertise in Visual Basic to create applications for the Internet. 
Essentially, ActiveX documents provide access to most of the key features of 
Visual Basic in a downloadable format.

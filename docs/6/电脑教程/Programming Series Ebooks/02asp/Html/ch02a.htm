<P>The heart and soul of any good Web site is the back-end server. The Web 
server can provide static Web pages in the form of HTML documents, but it can 
also execute applications that significantly enhance the content of a site. The 
idea of executing content on a Web server is not new. In past implementations, 
a Web server used the Common Gateway Interface, or CGI, to execute 
content. CGI is a technology that allows a Web server to start an executable and use 
that process to accomplish tasks such as sending e-mail. CGI applications add 
much-needed functionality to Web sites, but they are typically slow because a 
CGI application runs as a separate process. Since the Web server and the CGI 
application must exchange data across processes, communication between 
them is slowed down considerably.

<P>And don't forget about Java! This language has gained popularity quickly 
and is supported by both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. Applets 
created in Java with a tool such as Microsoft Visual 
J++ are very similar to ActiveX components: they are self-contained, downloadable chunks of content that 
can be rendered in a Web page. And like ActiveX components, applets get 
their own special tag. The &lt;APPLET&gt; tag tells a browser to download Java code 
and run it. The following code runs an applet in a Web page:
<PRE WIDTH="0">&lt;APPLET&#160;CODE=&quot;DBLBULB.CLASS&quot;&#160;HEIGHT=35&#160;WIDTH=26&gt;
&lt;/APPLET&gt;
</PRE>
<P>The CODE attribute of the &lt;APPLET&gt; tag identifies the source code 
of the Java applet in much the same way that the CODEBASE attribute 
identifies the source for an ActiveX component. Applets can also have &lt;PARAM&gt; 
tags that specify initial values. In many ways, applets are the functional 
equivalent of ActiveX controls. In fact, scripting languages can access the public 
functions in applets just as they can access the methods of ActiveX components.

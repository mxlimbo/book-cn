<H1>Part I: Setting Up a New Web Project</H1>
<H2>
<B>Step 1</B>
</H2>
<P>To begin a new Web project, start Visual InterDev. Choose New from the 
File menu. When the New dialog box appears (Figure 7-1), click the Projects 
tab and choose the Web Project wizard. Specify a location for your project files 
in the Location text box, give your project the name Catalog, and click OK.

<I>The New dialog box.</I>
<P>The Web Project wizard will ask you for the name of the Web server 
on which the new project will be created. If this text box contains an entry, you 
can accept it; if the box is empty, type the name of the machine that is 
running Internet Information Server (or Personal Web Server). (If you don't know 
the correct name of your Web server, look up the Identification information 
by using the Network applet in the Control Panel.) Click Next.
<P>The Web Project wizard (Figure 7-2) will contact the selected Web 
server and present the step 2 dialog box. Choose the option Create A New Web. 
Make sure the name of the web is Catalog. Check the option to enable full-text 
searching of the site. Click Finish. The Web Project wizard will create your new 
web and open the project.

<H2>
<B>Step 2</B>
</H2>
<P>When the Web Project wizard creates your project, several elements are 
provided by default. You can examine these elements by clicking the FileView 
tab, which lists files named GLOBAL.ASA and SEARCH.HTM and a 
directory named IMAGES. These filenames might appear gray because they exist on 
the Web server but not in your working directory. Choose Web Project/Get 
Working Copy from the Project menu to update your working files.
<P>Double-click GLOBAL.ASA. This is a special file that Visual InterDev 
uses to track the beginning and end of user sessions. Visual InterDev will use 
this file later to initialize a data connection.
<H2>
<B>Step 3</B>
</H2>
<P>This project utilizes a Microsoft Access database named HOME.MDB to 
provide the online database of catalog items. In order to access this database, 
you must establish an ODBC data source on your machine.
<P>Minimize Visual InterDev. You will now be working with the ODBC 
Data Source Administrator (Figure 7-3) to create your new data source. Open 
the Control Panel by choosing Settings/Control Panel from the Start menu. 
Locate the icon labeled ODBC. Double-click this icon to open the ODBC Data 
Source Administrator.

<I>The ODBC Data Source Administrator.</I>
<P>The ODBC Data Source Administrator creates ODBC data sources 
from existing databases. Data sources that you use with Visual InterDev must 
be System DSN or File DSN sources. Click the System DSN tab, and then click 
the Add button.
<P>In the Create New Data Source dialog box, select Microsoft Access 
Driver and click Finish. The ODBC Data Source Administrator will display the 
setup dialog box for Access data sources.
<P>In the Data Source Name text box, type 
<I>HomePage</I>. This is the ODBC alias you will use to access the database. Click the Select button, and locate the 
file HOME.MDB. This will associate the database with the ODBC alias 
HomePage. Click OK. The data source is now established, and you can exit the ODBC 
Data Source Administrator.
<H2>
<B>Step 4</B>
</H2>
<P>Maximize Visual InterDev again. Now you will add the data source to your 
Web project. On the FileView tab, click the project title and choose Add To 
Project/Data Connection from the Project menu. When the Select Data Source 
dialog box appears, click the Machine Data Source tab, choose the HomePage 
data source, and click OK. Visual InterDev will add a new data connection to 
your Web project based on the HomePage data source. This is the database that 
you will use to display items for sale on the site.
<P>Note that Visual Interdev has added a new tab to your project window, 
the Data View tab. Click this tab to view the database structure. The database 
contains three tables&#151;Categories, Products, and Orders&#151;which store all the 
data for the online catalog.
<P>Double-click the Categories table. The table, shown in Figure 7-4, 
consists of three fields: CategoryID, CategoryName, and 
CategoryDescription. Each category will appear on the home page. If you want to add or remove 
categories, you can simply change the data by using the Visual InterDev data 
tools, and all changes will be reflected immediately on the home page. You need 
not rewrite the Web site.

<P>Double-click the Products table, which stores all the product 
information for the catalog categories. The Products table, shown in Figure 7-5, 
contains the following fields: ProductID, CategoryID, ProductName, 
ProductDescription, ProductPrice, and ProductImage. Any single product is associated 
with a category through the CategoryID field. You can easily add a new product 
to the database by entering new information and associating it with an 
existing CategoryID.
<P>The ProductImage field holds the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) 
for the image of the product. Normally, an image is downloaded rather than 
stored in the database directly. The site uses the ProductImage data to 
dynamically load an &lt;IMG&gt; tag with an image.

<P>Double-click the Orders table, which is used to capture order 
information from customers. (See Figure 7-6.) In this project, you will build an 
order form that populates the database with a new record for each order. You 
can then examine the contents to fill orders.

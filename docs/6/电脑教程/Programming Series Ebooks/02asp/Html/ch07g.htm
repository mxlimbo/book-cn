<P>When a customer places an order, your Web page displays a message box 
as confirmation. Try changing the confirmation to show some Dynamic 
HTML on the ORDERS.ASP page. You will need to add some HTML to the page to 
 affect the display when the order is made. Try using the Visibility argument 
of the STYLE attribute to show and hide the confirmation.

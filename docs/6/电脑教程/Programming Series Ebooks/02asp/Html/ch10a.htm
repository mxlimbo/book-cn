<H1>Microsoft Transaction Server</H1>
<P>Although stand-alone Web applications are gaining significant 
momentum as a business solution, browser-based products are also likely to appear as 
additions to existing enterprise systems. For many businesses, browser access 
to business systems represents a powerful new way to provide information to 
remote locations. These remote sites might consist of customers who need 
technical support, other offices within the same company that are not part of an 
existing wide-area network (WAN), or even employees who are 
telecommuting across a modem. Demand for access can easily strain existing enterprise 
hardware that was not originally selected with external connection in mind.
<P>As an application begins to scale into hundreds or even thousands 
of users, system resources become the limiting factor. Internet lore is full of 
stories about sites that were unprepared for a high level of demand and had 
to be shut down the same day they debuted. That is where Microsoft 
Transaction Server (MTS) enters the picture.
<P>MTS is designed to provide all the features necessary to efficiently use 
the resources of machines hosting business systems. In particular, MTS 
provides pooling for three key system resources: threads, objects, and ODBC 
connections. MTS also includes features such as transaction management, but 
this chapter will focus only on using MTS to scale your site.
<P>MTS relies heavily on the creation of COM business objects to 
efficiently manage middle tier functionality. These COM objects can be created in 
any visual development tool that supports them, including Microsoft Visual 
Basic, Microsoft Visual C++, Microsoft Visual J++, and Microsoft Visual FoxPro, 
but all the business objects created in this chapter will be built in Visual Basic. 
The chapter does not attempt to teach the fundamentals of constructing 
Visual Basic business objects but focuses instead on special techniques required to 
use these components under MTS. Therefore, you should be familiar with 
the process of creating ActiveX DLL projects in Visual Basic 5.0 prior to using 
these techniques on your Web site.

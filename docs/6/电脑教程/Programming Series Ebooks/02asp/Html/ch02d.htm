<P>FrontPage server extensions play a valuable role when you develop 
content using Visual InterDev and Microsoft FrontPage. FrontPage server 
extensions are a set of programs and scripts that allow Visual InterDev and FrontPage 
to communicate with your Web server. This is important because these tools 
use the extensions to create new projects or to load existing ones. Normally, 
the extensions are installed when the server is installed, but this might not be 
true for all servers. Therefore, FrontPage ships with a utility called FrontPage 
Server Administrator, which allows you to manually install and maintain the 
extensions on a server. (See Figure 2-15.)
<P>In this utility, you can specify which server receives the extensions 
and you can provide additional information such as the port for installation. 
Generally, all you need to do is select the server and click the Install 
button&#151;the administrator takes care of the rest. If you later encounter difficulties 
locating your server with either Visual InterDev or FrontPage, you can use 
FrontPage Server Administrator to verify that the server extensions are properly 
installed on your Web server.

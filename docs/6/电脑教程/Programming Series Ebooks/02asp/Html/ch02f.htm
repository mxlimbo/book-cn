<H1>Using ODBC Data Sources</H1>

<P>Because the Web server plays a key role in database publishing, it must be 
able to access a variety of data. All the tools used by IIS to publish data rely on 
Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) data sources. ODBC is a 
database-independent technology for accessing data. ODBC is particularly useful in Web 
applications and simplifies development by allowing Web pages to utilize standard 
Structured Query Language (SQL) syntax to interact with a database.
<P>Before you can access a database with ODBC, you must set up an 
ODBC data source. Data sources are established using ODBC Data Source 
Administrator, an applet identified as the ODBC icon in the Control Panel. The 
administrator window is shown in Figure 2-16.

<P>Once inside ODBC Data Source Administrator, you can set up a new 
data source or modify an existing one. ODBC version 3.0 supports three 
different types of data sources: User, System, and File. A User data source is 
available only to the user who creates it and can be run only from the machine 
where it is defined. A System data source is available to all users of, and services 
running on, the current machine. A File data source is available to users across 
the enterprise, provided they have the necessary ODBC drivers installed on 
their machines.
<P>ODBC drivers are middleware that is able to convert SQL syntax to 
proprietary formats required by individual database engines. ODBC drivers 
are the primary component in ODBC that provides the database 
independence. Each driver is responsible for mapping the common functionality of SQL 
to the specific functionality of any database engine.
<P>Establishing an ODBC data source is an important first step in any 
Web development effort. The data source you set up should be appropriate for 
its intended use. You select a User, System, or File source based on the degree 
of availability you require for the data source. Typically, you would use a 
System data source for most Internet applications. 
<P>When you establish an ODBC data source, you are required to 
provide key information that allows the ODBC driver to access the data source. In 
all cases, you must first provide a name for the data source. The name is 
arbitrary and can be anything you want; it will be used by your script code to access 
the data source through ODBC. Depending on the driver, you might also have 
to provide additional information. For example, if you set up a SQL Server 
data source, you must tell the driver which machine on the enterprise has the 
SQL Server data and the name of the database on the machine that you want 
to connect with. The setup dialog box is shown in Figure 2-17.

<P>Once the required information is entered, you can close the dialog 
box and the data source is available for use. In most Web applications you 
create, you will want to make the ODBC connection available to your site 
through Visual InterDev. Adding an ODBC data source to Visual InterDev is 
accomplished by choosing Add To Project/Data Connection from the Project 
menu. A data connection allows Visual InterDev to recognize an ODBC data 
source and to help you manage it. When a data connection is added to a 
Visual InterDev project, a new tab, Data View, appears in the project window. 
(See Figure 2-18.) This tab gives you access to some sophisticated data tools that 
allow you to add, edit, update, and delete database records. You can even change 
the table structure directly in Visual InterDev. Throughout your projects, you 
will make extensive use of these tools. In many ways, they are superior to some 
of the tools that actually ship with many databases!

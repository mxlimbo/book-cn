<H1>An Online Bookstore</h1>
<P>This project creates a virtual bookstore using Microsoft Active Server 
Pages (ASP) technology. You will construct several pages that advertise books 
and take orders. The primary component of the project is the Connection 
component, which uses ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) to access ODBC data sources.

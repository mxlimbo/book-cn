<P>Internet Explorer (IE) version&#160;4.0 is Microsoft's latest Web browser. This 
version comes packed with enhancements that greatly improve the Internet 
experience. Many of these features, such as Active Desktop, are targeted at 
the end user, but other features are specifically placed to assist content 
developers. In order to create great content for sites that will host IE&#160;4.0, designers 
and programmers must understand the full impact of the client-side features.

<P>Active Desktop is the name given to the complete integration of the 
operating system shell with Internet Explorer&#160;4.0. This integration allows you to 
customize the desktop with elements from any Web page. Essentially, the 
Web page replaces your wallpaper and gives you a constant view of the 
Internet. (See Figure&#160;3-1.)
<P>Active Desktop is controlled through the Display Properties dialog 
box, which is accessed by clicking the desktop with the right mouse button 
and choosing Properties. This is the same action you would take to alter the 
desktop under the normal Microsoft Windows shell. When the dialog box 
appears, however, you'll notice that a Web tab has been added. (See Figure&#160;3-2 on 
the following page.)
<P>The Web tab provides new ways of customizing the desktop. First, you 
can add new individual Web sites to your desktop. These sites can contain 
any component that can be rendered in IE&#160;4.0, including ActiveX controls, 
Java applets, and HTML pages. To add a new site, simply click the New button 
and enter the site's URL in the New Active Desktop Item dialog box. Each new 
site you add appears on the desktop as a scrolling frame. Second, you can 
specify a local HTML page to use as your desktop. This is a great feature for 
network administrators who want to provide hyperlink access to network 
facilities through corporate intranets. A complete intranet site directory can be 
established as a local HTML page that gives users single-click access to forms,


information requests, databases, and schedules. Finally, if you don't like 
any of the displays, you can return to the standard desktop by simply checking
Disable All Web-Related Content In My Desktop in the Display Properties dialog box.

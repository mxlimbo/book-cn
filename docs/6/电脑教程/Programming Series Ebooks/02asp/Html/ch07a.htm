<H1>An Online Catalog</H1>
<P>This project creates an online catalog named 
<I>The Home Page,</I> an imaginary store that offers household goods for purchase on the Web. With a few 
small exceptions, this project is designed completely with client-side 
technologies, including Dynamic HTML and current-record data binding.

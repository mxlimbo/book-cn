<P>What a difference one product cycle can make! Not long ago, 
conventional wisdom had Microsoft dead at the hands of the Internet. Today it isn't news 
to anyone that Microsoft has successfully recast itself as an ally of the 
Internet. But what continues to amaze is the magnitude of the consequences for 
developers. When Microsoft first responded to the demand for Internet 
development tools, products were primitive by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, 
Web developers joked that their favorite development tool was &quot;Visual 
Notepad.&quot; Now, however, no one is joking. The suite of tools released in Microsoft 
Visual Studio 97 represents a firm commitment to the Internet, and the next 
generation of tools is on its way. This is a great time to be a Web developer.

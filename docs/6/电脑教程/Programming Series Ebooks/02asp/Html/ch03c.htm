<P>Internet Explorer&#160;4.0 now supports server 
<I>push,</I> or Internet broadcasting to a Web client. A Web site that offers content push as a service can broadcast 
Web content through a channel created through a Channel Definition File, or 
CDF. A CDF contains key information about the site and its content, including 
content use and update frequency.
<P>When a channel is available to the Web client, it appears on the 
desktop as a logo icon in the Channel Bar. The Channel Bar contains a list of all 
Web sites connected to CDFs, enabling you to switch easily between the sites. 
Once a channel is established, IE&#160;4.0 automatically monitors the site and 
downloads new content as necessary. The broadcast is enhanced by a television-style 
view of the site (shown in Figure 3-3), which is created by running IE&#160;4.0 in 
full-screen mode.

<H1>An Online Magazine</h1>
<P>This project creates an online magazine using the Content Linking 
component of Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP). The Content Linking 
component allows you to treat a series of Web pages as a linked set of pages in a 
magazine, newspaper, or book. You will also use a database to provide the content to 
the site dynamically, rather than hard-coding each new page.

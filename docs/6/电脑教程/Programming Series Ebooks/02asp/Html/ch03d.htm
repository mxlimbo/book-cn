<P>For any site, even one that does not accommodate channels, Internet 
Explorer&#160;4.0 will support a 
<I>subscription.</I> A subscription sets up an automatic 
download of a site on a periodic basis. A subscription is fundamentally different 
from a channel because the browser checks the site as opposed to the site 
broadcasting to the browser. This means that you can ask IE&#160;4.0 to check a given site 
for new content and download at regular intervals. If the computer must use 
dial-up networking, a subscription can be established so that the modem is 
used automatically.

<H1>Part I: Setting Up the ODBC Data Source</H1>
<P>Before you can use the ODBC API, you must set up an ODBC data source. 
In this exercise, you will interact with the Microsoft Access database 
NORTHWIND.MDB, which ships with Visual Basic and which is included on the 
companion CD-ROM.
<P>Establishing the data source is not a development tool function, but 
rather an operating system function. Setup is accomplished using the ODBC 
Data Source Administrator utility found in Microsoft Windows.
<H2>
<B>Step 1</B>
</H2>
<P>In the Control Panel, locate an icon labeled ODBC. Double-click this icon 
to start the ODBC Data Source Administrator.
<H2>
<B>Step 2</B>
</H2>
<P>In order to create a new data source, click the System DSN tab and then 
click the Add button.
<H2>
<B>Step 3</B>
</H2>
<P>The Create New Data Source dialog box will appear, listing all the ODBC 
drivers available on your machine. For this exercise, you will need the 
Microsoft Access driver. Choose this driver from the list, and click Finish.
<H2>
<B>Step 4</B>
</H2>
<P>When the ODBC Setup dialog box appears, you can define the new data 
source. First, you must provide a name. This can be any name, but for this 
exercise, type <I>NorthWind.</I>
<P>Next, click the Select button and navigate the file system until you 
find the NORTHWIND.MDB file. Select this database file.
<P>Click the OK button, and back out of the ODBC Data Source 
Administrator. You have now defined the data source.

<A NAME="38"><H1>Network Security</H1></A>

<p>Now that we've briefly explained how security is enforced on a local machine, you are ready to look at security when accessing secured objects over a network. As we saw earlier, the MSNP redirector is responsible for accessing resources among computers. The MSNP redirector is also responsible for establishing a secure link between a client and a server by creating user session credentials.</p>

<A NAME="39"><H2>Session Credentials</H2></A>

<p>There are two types of user credentials: primary login and session credentials. When a user sitting in front of a workstation logs on to the machine, the user name and the password presented by the user become the primary set of credentials and are stored in an access token. Only one set of primary credentials exists at any given time. When a user attempts to establish a connection (either mapping a drive or connecting through UNC names) to a remote resource, the user's primary credentials are used to validate access to the remote resource. Note that with Windows NT and Windows 2000, the user has the option of supplying a different set of credentials to be used in validating with the remote resource. If the user's credentials are valid, the MSNP redirector forms a session between the user's computer and the remote resource. The redirector associates the session with session credentials, which consist of a copy of the credentials the user's computer used to validate the connection with the remote resource. Only one set of session credentials can be established at a time between a user's computer and a remote server. If machine B has two share points, \Hack and \Slash, and if the user of machine A maps \Hack to G and \Slash to H, both sessions share the same session credentials because they both refer to the same remote server.</p>

<p>The MSNP redirector server service handles security access control on a remote server. When the MSNP redirector server attempts to access a secured object, it uses the session credentials to create a remote access token. From there, security is managed as if the access were made locally. Figure 2-3 demonstrates how the MSNP redirector establishes security credentials using Windows NT domain security.</p>

<p>There are plenty of times when an update attempt fails for reasons
other than optimistic updating conflicts. A database that preserves
referential integrity might reject a user's attempt to delete a
record from the Customers table for a customer who has open orders. An
error will also occur if the user tries to place more data into a field
than the database can store. The user could also violate a field
constraint in the database by trying to set a customer's balance
due to a negative number.</p>

<p>The ADO Cursor Engine doesn't consider these types of failed
updates to be conflicts. Your best bet is to anticipate which changes
your users might request that would fail because of such problems, and
then develop error-handling code that can detect and resolve such
problems appropriately.</p>

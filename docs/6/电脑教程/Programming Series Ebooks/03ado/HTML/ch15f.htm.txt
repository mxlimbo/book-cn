<p><b>Q. <i>I remember someone telling me once
that ADO marshaled large Recordsets asynchronously. Is that
true?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> That was true for a brief period of time. In version 2.0,
ADO marshaled large (8 KB or larger) client-side Recordsets
asynchronously. You could turn off this feature by setting a key in the
Registry. The ADO development team later decided that this
feature's drawbacks outweighed its benefits. Starting with version
2.1, large Recordsets are once again marshaled synchronously by
default. For more information on this feature, see Microsoft's
Knowledge Base.</p>

<p><b>Q.<i> I'm using client-side Recordsets
with batch optimistic locking in a three-tiered application. I can
modify a record in the Recordset object in my client application and
successfully submit that change to the database by passing the
Recordset object to my business object, reconnecting it to the
database, and calling the</i> UpdateBatch <i>method. But if I try to
modify that same record again in my client Recordset object, the update
fails when I try to submit that change to the database. I get an error
saying, &quot;The specified row could not be located for
updating.&quot; Why am I having this problem?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> You're running into one of the minor drawbacks of
passing your Recordset to the business object by value. Let's look
at the changes you're making to the Recordset object in your client
application. Suppose you change a customer's balance due from $75
to $125 in your client-side Recordset. When you send that Recordset to
the business object to submit the update, ADO generates the following
action query:</p>

<p>As if passing a Recordset object and all of its contents across
process boundaries using DCOM weren't impressive enough, the ADO
Cursor Engine also helps you pass Recordsets across the Internet by
means of HTTP (or HTTPS), using a set of libraries called Remote Data
Service (RDS).</p>

<p>You can use RDS with any Microsoft Visual Studio language to develop
applications that communicate over the Internet almost as easily as you
can develop applications that communicate over your intranet. We'll
cover RDS in more detail in <A HREF="ch16a.htm">Chapter 16</A>.</p>

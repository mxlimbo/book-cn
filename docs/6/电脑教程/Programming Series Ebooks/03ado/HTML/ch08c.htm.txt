<p>Updatable Recordset objects are definitely a RAD concept. Forget
about having to fetch data from a Recordset object and into your own
data structures, such as Variant arrays, collections, business objects,
user-defined types (UDTs), and eXtensible Markup Language (XML) tags!
No longer do you have to create and call stored procedures or generate
your own action queries! Say goodbye to writing a bunch of code!
Decrease the amount of time required to build the database connectivity
layer of your application! Why, you can even leverage a plethora of
data-bound controls, which can reduce the time you spend developing the
user interface layer!</p>

<p>I intentionally worded the previous paragraph to make updatable
Recordsets sound as sensational as an infomercial would. (What scares
me is that the spelling checker didn't blink at my use of
&quot;infomercial.&quot;) You might be wondering whether updatable
Recordsets will let you scramble an egg while it's still inside its
shell. Used properly, updatable Recordsets can save you more time than
anything sold in an infomercial. Plus, there's no shipping or
handling costs. And just look how this code can cut a tin can in half
and still remain sharp enough to slice a tomato!</p>

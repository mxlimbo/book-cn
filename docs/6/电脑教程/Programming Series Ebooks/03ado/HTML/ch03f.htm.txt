<A NAME="70"><H1>Managing Your Transactions</H1></A>

<p>There are times when you want to make a batch of changes to your
database and you require that either all or none of the changes are
made to the database; you can't allow partial transactions to
complete. For example, imagine that you want to transfer money from
your savings account to your checking account. The bank won't be
happy if the withdrawal from your savings account fails but the deposit
into your checking account succeeds. Similarly, you'll be less than
thrilled if the converse occurs. If either task does not complete
successfully, the other task should be canceled. In transactional
programming, this all-or-nothing trait is called atomicity.</p>

<p>ADO offers a number of features to help you use transactions in your
application.</p>

<p>You can use ADO's transactional methods to manage atomic units
of work. Let's say that you're writing the software for an ATM
machine. You could create code such as the following that makes use of
ADO's transactional methods:</p>

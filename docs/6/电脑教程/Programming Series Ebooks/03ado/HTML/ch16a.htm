<p>Since its initial release, Microsoft has touted ADO as the data
access model of choice for Internet programmers. In the 1.0 release,
ADO was a server-side technology designed for programmers of Active
Server Pages (ASP). Shortly after the initial release of ADO, Microsoft
released a technology called Advanced Data Connector (ADC), which has
since been renamed Remote Data Service (RDS). In this chapter,
we'll cover the RDS object model and look at how RDS can help you
build applications designed to work over the Internet.</p>

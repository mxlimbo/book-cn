<p><b>Q. <i>Should I avoid using a Connection
object if I'm not planning to use any of its properties and
methods?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> There's no definite answer to this question, but I use
a Connection object unless I'm going to open only a single
Recordset in my application. My recommendation is to use a Connection
object until you have your application working the way you'd like.
If you then want to try opening your Recordsets without a Connection
object, give it a shot and see if you've improved performance. Also
check that you aren't creating additional physical connections to
your database. Just be sure to back up your application before making
such changes. There's nothing worse than breaking an application
that was working fine, and then not being able to easily revert back to
the working version.</p>

<p><b>Q. <i>Then should I generally use all of
the other objects in the ADO object model as well?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> Let's not jump to conclusions. If I give you all the
answers in the second chapter, what kind of book would this be?
We'll talk about ADO objects in more detail in Chapters 3 through
6. You'll learn about the features available in each object, and
you should end up with a good idea of when to use each one.</p>

<A NAME="25"><H1>New Objects in ADO 2.5</H1></A>

<p>ADO 2.5 extends the concept of universal data access into new areas
with the Record and Stream objects.</p>

<A NAME="26"><H2> Record Object</H2></A>

<p>Not all data is rectangular like that in a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet. The Record object is designed primarily for interacting
with document-based data-like file and directory structures. The Record
object makes it possible for ADO to interact with data that resembles a
hierarchical tree, such as the directories and files on a hard drive. A
Record object can correspond to a row in a Recordset object, or it can
represent an object in a hierarchy such as a file directory.</p>

<p>None of the &quot;traditional&quot; database providers or drivers
included with Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 2.5 support the
Record object. In <A HREF="ch06a.htm">Chapter 6</A>, we'll cover the Record object in more
depth and show some examples of using the object with a couple of the
providers that support it.</p>

<A NAME="27"><H2> Stream Object</H2></A>

<p>While the Record object can help you work with hierarchical
directory structures, the Stream object lets you access the data stored
in the hierarchy. For example, you can use the Record object to
traverse through a file and directory structure on a hard drive via the
OLE DB provider for Microsoft Active Directory Services. Then you can
use the Stream object to retrieve the contents of the files that the
Record object refers to.</p>

<p>However, it's not necessary to use the Record object and the Stream
object together. The Record object is limited to a few nondatabase OLE
DB providers with the release of MDAC 2.5, but you can use the Stream
object with more traditional database applications. The Stream object
exposes methods that make working with binary large object (BLOB) data
such as SQL Server text and image fields much simpler than do the Field
object's <i>GetChunk</i> and <i>AppendChunk</i> methods. (See
<A HREF="ch04a.htm">Chapter 4</A> for more on these methods.) You can also use the Stream
object to store Recordset objects rather than having to write them to
your hard drive.</p>

<p>We'll discuss the Stream object in more depth in <A HREF="ch06a.htm"><A HREF="ch06a.htm">Chapter 6</A>.</A></p>

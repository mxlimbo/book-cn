<p><b>Q.<i> How does the StayInSync property on the Recordset object
work? I can never make it work the way I want.</i></b> </p>

<p><b>A.</b> The StayInSync property controls whether a reference to a child
level of a hierarchy will remain synchronized with the current position
of its parent level. Say you open a customers and orders hierarchy with
the customer data as the parent and obtain a reference to the orders
level of the hierarchy. By default, as you navigate through the
customer data, the orders Recordset object variable will always contain
the orders for the current customer. Suppose you want to reference
orders for a customer without the contents of the orders object
variable changing when you move to another customer. You can set the
StayInSync property on the customers Recordset to False before
obtaining a reference to the orders level of the hierarchy, as shown
here:</p>

<A NAME="2"><H1>David Sceppa</H1></A>

<p>David Sceppa grew up in the town of Westwood, Massachusetts, where
he learned right (Red Sox, Celtics) from wrong (Yankees, Lakers) and
idolized John Cleese. He was fortunate to live in a town with a public
school system that encouraged him to develop strong mathematical and
computer programming skills. While in high school, David worked
part-time on a Paradox database system at Enterprise Leasing of New
England, where he never thought the company would outgrow its (then)
enormous 20-MB hard drive.</p>

<p>David attended Princeton University, earning a degree in mathematics
and participating in the teacher preparation program. He spent summers
developing and maintaining a FoxPro database system for a company that
assembled circuit boards.</p>

<p>After graduation, David moved to the other end of Interstate
90&#8212;Seattle&#8212;where he briefly attended the University of
Washington as a graduate student before accepting a job as a Microsoft
FoxPro support professional. He later joined the Microsoft Visual Basic
database support team and now acts as a technical lead, interacting
with customers and development teams within Microsoft. David is also a
Microsoft Certified Solution Developer.</p>

<p>David has recently discovered that he likes bebop jazz and that he
can't keep a straight face while writing about himself in the third
person. His long-term goals are to complete a marathon, teach
mathematics to high school students, win an award for his world-famous
chili, and see the Red Sox win a World Series.</p>

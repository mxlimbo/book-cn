<p>As you know, multiple users often want to change the same data in
your database at the same time. If users would simply agree not to do
this, developing multiuser database applications would be much easier.
Of course, you can prevent users from changing the same data at the
same time by utilizing pessimistic locking in your database, but
that's overly restrictive in comparison to optimistic locking.
Besides, pessimistic locking is for lazy programmers.</p>

<p>So rather than take the easy way out and write an application
that's too restrictive, you choose optimistic locking. You decide

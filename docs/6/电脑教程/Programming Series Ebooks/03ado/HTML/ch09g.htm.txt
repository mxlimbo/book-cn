<p>A salesman walks into a psychiatrist's office and says,
&quot;Doc, you <i>have</i> to help me!&quot; No, wait, that's not
it&#8230;.</p>

<p>A salesman walks into the MIS director's office and says,
&quot;Fred, you <i>have</i> to help me! The order entry system is
wonderful, but I need you to modify it slightly so that I can load it
onto my laptop. I want to enter new customers and orders while I'm
out on the road, save them on my hard drive, and load them into the
database when I'm done playing golf&#8230;I mean when I'm back
in the office.&quot;</p>

<p>Those clever programmers on the ADO team thought of this exact
scenario (even though programmers, by trade, tend not to get along with
salespeople). You can save a client-side Recordset to a file and reopen
it at a later time, as shown in the following code snippet. If you
choose, you can even send that persisted recordset as an e-mail
attachment and have another user or application open it.</p>

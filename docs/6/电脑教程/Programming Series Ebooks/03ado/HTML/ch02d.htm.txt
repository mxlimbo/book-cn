<p>With DAO and RDO, it's fairly simple to explain to a programmer
new to the object model how to connect to and query the desired
database. In each case, you use the object model to create an object
that represents a connection to your database. Then you use that object
to retrieve the results of your query into another object.</p>

<p>As I explained earlier, you can follow the same pattern with the ADO
object model. However, you can also open an ADO Recordset to retrieve
the results of your query in a single call without using either a
Connection object or a Command object. This flexibility makes the
process of determining the &quot;right&quot; way to get your data more
complicated.</p>

<p>There are times when you won't want to use all of the objects in
the ADO hierarchy. For example, perhaps you have no intention of
executing a query more than once, so you don't have any need to use
the Command object. Or maybe your application will require only one
Recordset object, and you don't plan to use the Connection object
for any reason other than to retrieve the results of that one query.
The following sections discuss these and other examples in detail.</p>

<A NAME="18"><H2>Obtaining a Recordset Without a Command Object</H2></A>

<p>If you are not going to execute your query more than once, or if you
won't need Parameter objects, you probably don't need to use a
Command object. As was shown in Figure 2-1, you can use a
Recordset object with a Connection object without having to use a
Command object. Here's an example:</p>

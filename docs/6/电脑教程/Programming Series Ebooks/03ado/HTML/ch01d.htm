<A NAME="10"><H1>Where's the Code?</H1></A>

<p>Since, as I mentioned before, there's no single &quot;best
way&quot; to use ADO, I'm not going to focus on building a large
sample application. While I think a large sample that shows off most of
ADO's functionality is an attractive idea, I don't think
it's appropriate for this text. Too often the material covered in a
technical book focuses too heavily on the code and features used in the
sample application. That's great&#8212;if your design goals meet
those of the sample application. You're ultimately better off with
a solid understanding of all of ADO's features rather than just the
ones used in a large sample.</p>

<p>So instead, I've included some code on the companion CD that
isn't so much a sample application as it is a set of tools to help
you learn how to discover more about ADO. The more you learn about ADO
and how the objects tend to behave, the more comfortable you'll
become with determining what will happen in specific situations.</p>

<p>Probably the best example I can give of such a situation deals with
conflict detection and resolution with the ADO Cursor Engine. <A HREF="ch12a.htm">Chapter
12</A> covers this topic in a fair amount of depth, but that information is
not exhaustive by any means. The goal of the chapter is to help you
understand what's going on behind the scenes and to show you what
types of problems to look for (and how to handle them) when you're
developing your application.</p>

<p>To help illustrate the issue of conflict detection, I've
included on the companion CD a sample named Detecting Conflicts that I
wrote to help me understand how to handle specific conflicts. You can
modify that sample to work with your database and your query to
determine what to do in your own application. But that's only one
of the reasons I've included the sample.</p>

<p>As you learn more about ADO (and other technologies, database or
otherwise), questions will naturally arise. You might see a particular
method and ask yourself, &quot;What happens to <i>my</i> data
if&#8230;?&quot; No book, training, or phone call to technical support
will ever be able to answer all of your questions. What's much more
valuable is learning how to answer those questions yourself, and this
conflict detection sample shows you how.</p>

<p><A HREF="chaba.htm">Appendix B</A> of this book contains a description of the sample
applications and tools included on the companion CD. Use the samples to
learn more about ADO, and take a look at the code in the samples,
including the comments, to understand how to come up with your own
tests and samples to answer your questions.</p>

<p>With a solid basic understanding of ADO (and with a slightly devious
mindset), you can create well-built data access applications.
You'll be able to answer your own questions and continue to develop
more expertise without having to say, &quot;I wish I'd known that
before I started writing all this code.&quot; It is my hope that this
book will help you develop that understanding.</p>

<p>Let's get started.</p>

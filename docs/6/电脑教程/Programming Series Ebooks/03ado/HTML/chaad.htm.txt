<p><b>Q. <i>Does an Access QueryDef correspond to an ADOX View or
Procedure object?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> Access considers all queries to be QueryDefs, but many database
systems categorize queries as either views or stored procedures. So, is
an Access QueryDef a view or a stored procedure? The general rule is
that the QueryDef is a view unless it's an action query (UPDATE,
DELETE, INSERT, and so on), or unless it accepts parameters, in which
case it's considered a stored procedure. If you add a QueryDef to
an Access database, you can use <i>Views.Append</i> or <i>
Procedures.Append</i> regardless of whether the QueryDef corresponds to
a view or a stored procedure. In the Make Northwind sample on the
companion CD, I add all QueryDefs to the database through <i>
Views.Append</i>.</p>

<p><b>Q. <i>I can't seem to add a QueryDef to my Access database. I
don't get any errors, so I think I'm creating it correctly, but
I don't see the QueryDef when I open my database in Access. Am I
doing something wrong?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> In this case, if you're not generating an error, you're
not doing anything wrong. This behavior is the result of a problem in
the Jet 4.0 OLE DB Provider. This problem is not isolated to ADOX. If
you generate your own action query to create a QueryDef, you will not
see the new QueryDef when you open the database in Access. However, the
QueryDef does exist. You can see it in the Visual Basic DataView
window, and you can call the QueryDef with ADO.</p>

<p><b>Q. <i>The sample code in the &quot;<A HREF="chaab.htm#453">ADOX Security Sample</A>&quot; section
of this appendix was handy, but I'm having problems with it. I was
able to run it once, but when I ran it a second time, I got errors
saying that the account name already exists. What went wrong?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> Actually, nothing went wrong. The behavior is by design, but
it's also worth explaining. Let's take a quick look at the
first line of code that generates this error:</p>

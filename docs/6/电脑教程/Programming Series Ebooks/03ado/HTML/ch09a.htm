<p>Of all the libraries included with the Microsoft Data Access
Components (MDAC), the Microsoft ADO Cursor Engine is my favorite.
There, I've said it. And I don't mind admitting it.</p>

<p>Some of the most vocal pundits in the software development community
gravitate toward one of two extremes. Some will tell you the tools they
recommend are so easy that you won't have to write a line of code.
Others believe that it's a bad idea to use anyone else's
components. They'd sooner write their own compiler than rely on
someone else's code.</p>

<p>I like to think that most developers lie somewhere in the
middle&#8212;they're happy to use someone else's tools if they
understand the tools and if the tools work well, but they're also
comfortable relying on their own programming skills when necessary.
When it comes to ADO, I see utilization of the ADO Cursor Engine as
that middle ground.</p>

<p>The ADO Cursor Engine has some powerful features, although it's
not perfect. The more experience you gain, the more clearly you'll
see the benefits and drawbacks of using the ADO Cursor Engine. This
chapter will provide you with an overview of the Cursor Engine features
that we'll discuss in the coming chapters.</p>

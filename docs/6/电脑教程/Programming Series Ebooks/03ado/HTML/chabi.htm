<h1>Make Northwind</h1>

<p>This project uses ActiveX Data Objects Extensions for Data
Definition Language and Security (ADOX) to create a database with
tables and queries that are nearly identical to the sample Northwind
database that ships with various versions of Visual Basic, Access, and
other Microsoft products. You might find this sample helpful if you
want to learn more about creating Access databases with ADOX, or if you
simply want to create a database similar to the Northwind sample.</p>

<p>The modCreateStructure module creates the new database file as well
as the tables and QueryDef objects. (Keep in mind that QueryDefs
created with the Jet 4.0 OLE DB Provider are not visible through the
Access 2000 user interface.) If you're having problems creating
tables or queries with ADOX, take a look at this portion of the
code.</p>

<p>This sample's folder includes a subdirectory named Data. The
files in this subdirectory correspond to the contents of the tables in
the Northwind database. After the sample uses the modCreateStructure
module to create the new database's structure, it uses the
modInsertData module to populate the new database's tables based on
the contents of these files. I've left the contents of the
Northwind database's BLOB (binary large object) fields out of these
data files to save some space and simplify the code in the sample.</p>

<p>Although the sample does not utilize the modLogData module, I've
included it with the project so you could see the code I used to
generate the files in the Data subdirectory.</p>

<p><b>Q. <i>Do you have a sample that shows how to use the Record object and the Stream object to work with document data?</i></b> </p>

<p><b>A. </b> Why yes, I do. The My Web Site sample included on the
companion CD uses the Record and Stream objects in conjunction with the
OLE DB Provider For Internet Publishing to interact with a web site.
You can upload and download files as well as copy, move, and delete
files and folders. For more information, see <a href="chaba.htm">Appendix B.</a></p>

<p><b>Q. <i>I'm a database programmer, and I work with databases such as SQL Server, Oracle, and Access. I've read all about the Record object, but I still don't see what value it offers me. Am I missing something?</i></b> </p>

<p><b>A. </b> Not really. The Record object is valuable for programmers
who want to access document data, such as files and e-mail messages,
through OLE DB providers that support the Record object. Don't try
to force the Record object into your applications.</p>

<p><b>Q. <i>I'm having problems connecting to my web site using the OLE DB Provider For Internet Publishing. Any suggestions?</i></b> </p>

<p><b>A. </b> Keep an eye on the online Knowledge Base on Microsoft's
Web site. As more programmers begin to use this OLE DB provider,
you'll likely see a FAQ that covers possible connection problems.
Web server setup, WebDAV, and security are not my forte.</p>

<p><b>Q. <i>In <A HREF="ch05a.htm">Chapter 5</A>, you recommended storing files in the file system rather than in the database. Now that the Stream object makes interacting with BLOB data simple, do you recommend storing the contents of files in databases?</i></b> </p>

<p><b>A. </b> No. Although the Stream object definitely simplifies
interacting with BLOB data (I'll never call <i>AppendChunk</i> or
<i>GetChunk</i> again!), I still recommend storing files in the file
system rather than in the database. While keeping the contents of your
files in your database might be simpler from the standpoints of
programming, backup, and security, you'll still achieve much better
performance by storing filenames in the database and using the
operating system to move files between the client and the server.</p>

<A NAME="336"><H1>Gathering Information from ADO</H1></A>

<p>Let's look at the error information ADO provides and what
features ADO offers programmers to help them determine why an
optimistic update attempt failed. The ADO object model contains some
properties and methods you can use to determine the type of
modification made to the record that contains pending changes and why
your update attempt failed.</p>

<A NAME="337"><H2>ADO's Error Information</H2></A>

<p>One of ADO's major drawbacks is that it often provides little
information through the Error object about what happened. It sometimes
returns the message, &quot;Errors occurred,&quot; which doesn't
help you determine why the error occurred. Trust me, the ADO
development team is aware of programmers' frustrations with this
error.</p>

<p>The Record and Stream objects, both new to ADO 2.5 and covered in
more depth in <A HREF="ch06a.htm">Chapter 6</A>, provide more detailed error information. The
development team had similar code in the works for the other ADO
objects, but they were concerned about the possibility of creating
compatibility problems with existing code. However, the team hasn't
given up, and they're currently investigating ways to improve on
the current error handling in the next release of ADO, after 2.5. So
for now, ADO objects that existed prior to 2.5 will still generate the
same error information in ADO 2.5 that they did in ADO 2.1 to maintain
backward compatibility.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>Maintaining backward compatibility can be quite a
burden. If you developed a Microsoft Internet Information Services
(IIS) and Active Server Pages (ASP) application using ADO 2.1 and built
error handlers to trap for optimistic updating errors or other problems
that generated the &quot;Errors occurred&quot; error, you might have to
rewrite your application if installing a newer version of ADO generated
different error messages when running the same code. This makes it
difficult for the ADO development team to improve on the &quot;Errors
occurred&quot; message.</blockquote></div>

<p>What sort of error information does ADO generate when optimistic
updates fail? Generally, you'll see your old friend:</p>

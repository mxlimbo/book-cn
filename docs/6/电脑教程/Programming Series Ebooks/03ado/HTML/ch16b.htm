<p>RDS is a series of components that allow client applications
anywhere on the Internet to communicate with business objects running
on internal servers. When you use RDS in a client application to
instantiate a business object running on another server, you don't
get the object itself. Instead, you receive what amounts to a pointer
to that object. The actual object will continue to reside on the
server. RDS then acts as a middleman. When your client code accesses
the pointer to your business object, RDS receives the request, packages
it, and sends it to the RDS server components. Then the RDS server
components access the business object, package the results, and return
them to your client code. This process is shown in Figure 16-1.</p>

<p>Two RDS components run on the client: the DataControl object, which
we'll discuss momentarily, and the DataSpace object, which
we'll cover later in the chapter. If you want to run a query
against a database, you can assign a connection string and a query
string to the DataControl object, and the DataControl object will
return an ADO Recordset object with the desired data. If you want to
access a business object running on your Internet Information Services
(IIS) server, you can use the DataSpace object to return a pointer to
that business object.</p>

<p>RDS also includes a server component called the DataFactory object,
which you'll learn about in the second half of this chapter. The
DataFactory object provides functionality similar to the DataControl
object. The library for the RDS server component is called RDSServer to
differentiate it from the client components.</p>

<p>Another RDS feature we'll discuss is that it allows you to use
handlers to control data access through the DataControl object. You can
use handlers to restrict access to your database and to simplify your
code.</p>

<p>Finally, as an alternative to using the RDS objects, Microsoft Data
Access Components (MDAC) includes an OLE DB provider that provides
functionality that closely resembles the DataControl object.</p>

<p>Let's take a closer look at the first of these features, the
DataControl object.</p>

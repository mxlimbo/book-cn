<p>Hierarchical recordsets are powerful and flexible. While I'll
include examples of some of the syntax options shortly, they will not
be exhaustive by any means. The documentation on the SHAPE syntax was
initially lacking but has improved in the MDAC 2.1 and MDAC 2.5
releases. Take a look at the documentation in the Data Access SDK and
the online Knowledge Base at the Microsoft Web site
(<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/search" target="_window2"><i>http://support.microsoft.com/search</a></i>) for more
information.</p>

<A NAME="374"><H2>The Data Environment Designer</H2></A>

<p>The Data Environment designer included with Visual Basic 6 and
Microsoft Office 2000 Developer Edition is a helpful tool for building
hierarchical queries.</p>

<p>I don't actually use the Data Environment designer in the
applications I build. But if I ever need to generate a hierarchical
query, I build it using the Data Environment designer and then look at
the query string the designer generated. Once I realized I could
right-click the top level of the hierarchical query in the Data
Environment designer and see the syntax it generated, I decided I
didn't need to learn the syntax by heart.</p>

<p>Earlier, you learned that different internal structures contain
different levels of standard hierarchies. In the customers and orders
standard hierarchy example, all the orders are kept in the same
structure. Starting with version 2.1 of ADO, you can access the
different levels of the hierarchy as though they were separate
Recordset objects.</p>

<p>If you use the following code to open your customers and orders
hierarchy</p>

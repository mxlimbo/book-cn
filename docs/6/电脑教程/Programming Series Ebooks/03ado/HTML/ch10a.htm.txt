<p>Whenever developers ask me why they're getting errors when they
use a client-side Recordset to update their data, I ask them if they
understand how ADO tries to update their data. I'm sometimes
surprised by their reaction to that question. The most common response
is, &quot;Why should I care what ADO is doing? I just want my code to
work.&quot;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't send customers to their rooms, and
telling them I'm disappointed in them rarely generates much of a
response. The less you know about how ADO updates your database when
you use a client-side cursor, the slimmer the chances that your
application will work reliably. That statement usually gets a
programmer's attention.</p>

<p>Let's look at a quick and dirty example of an update
operation:</p>

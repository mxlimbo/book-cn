<p><b>Q.<i> After I call the</i> Save <i>method,
will my cursor be positioned at the same record as it was prior to
calling this method?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> No. ADO moves you to the first record in the Recordset
after you've called the <i>Save</i> method.</p>

<p><b>Q.<i> When I call the</i> Requery <i>method
on the Recordset object I opened from a file or a stream, the method
fails. Have I done something wrong?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> You've done nothing wrong, but there's nothing more
you can do. As of ADO 2.5, you can't call the <i>Requery</i> method
when you reopen a persisted Recordset. Perhaps a future release will
provide a way to do this. However, you can still call the <i>Resync</i>
method successfully.</p>

<p><b>Q.<i> When I try to open a Recordset from a Stream object, I receive
an error message stating that the arguments are the wrong type. Why is
that?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> I noticed behavior that I found surprising when opening a
Recordset from a Stream object. Leave the ActiveConnection parameter on
the Recordset's <i>Open</i> method blank. Then set the
ActiveConnection property on your Recordset object to an open
Connection object or a valid connection string, and you should be
fine.</p>

<p><b>Q. <i>Why can't I persist a
parameterized hierarchical Recordset?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> You're getting ahead of yourself a bit. As of ADO 2.5,
there's no way to persist such a Recordset. In <A HREF="ch14a.htm">Chapter 14</A>,
we'll examine hierarchical Recordsets in more depth and explain why
this limitation currently exists. (Don't worry if this question
throws you for a loop.)</p>

<p><b>Q.<i> Do I need to work with a
client-side Recordset in order to use persistent data?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> No. ADO will let you save the contents of your Recordset
even with a server-side cursor. However, if you reopen your Recordset
from a file or a stream, that data will be stored by the ADO Cursor
Engine.</p>

<p><b>Q.<i> What does ADO do when I call the</i>
Save <i>method on a firehose cursor?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> When you use a firehose cursor, ADO doesn't store the
contents of the records you've already examined. If your cursor has
moved beyond the first record in the Recordset, ADO will reexecute your
query when you call the <i>Save</i> method. In the first question in
this section, I noted that when you call <i>Save</i>, ADO will move
your cursor to the first record of the Recordset. For a firehose
cursor, this means ADO will reexecute your query in order to move back
to the first record after persisting the Recordset. Keep this behavior
in mind if you plan to persist data from a firehose cursor, especially
if you want to call a stored procedure to generate your data.</p>

<p><b>Q.<i> Can I reopen my Recordset
asynchronously?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> As of ADO 2.5, yes. Prior to ADO 2.5, your asynchronous
request would have been ignored and would have opened
synchronously.</p>

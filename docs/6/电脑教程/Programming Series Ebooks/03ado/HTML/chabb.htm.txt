<h1>What's My Constant?</h1>

<p>While this sample probably won't help you to learn more about
ADO directly, I've leveraged this code as a tool in other projects
and samples.</p>

<p>How many times have you checked the value of a property only to
realize that you don't know what constant or combination of
constants that value represents? If you were to check the Status
property of the current record of the Recordset object to try to
determine the cause of a conflict, would you rather see 2052 or
adRecConcurrencyViolation + adRecDeleted?</p>

<p>The What's My Constant sample doesn't contain any forms.
Instead, the sample is a series of class modules that you can compile
into an ActiveX DLL. Once you have compiled the project, you can use
the classes in your own projects. For example, say you had trapped for
an optimistic updating conflict in your code and you wanted to
understand what constant (or combination of constants) that value
corresponds to. You could use this dynamic-link library in your project
by adding a reference to the WhatsMyConstant library and then adding
the following code:</p>

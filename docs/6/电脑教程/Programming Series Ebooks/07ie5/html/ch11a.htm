<P>
In <A HREF="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</A>, you learned how to enhance Web pages and create Web-based 
applications by using Microsoft JScript and Microsoft VBScript. But one of the 
biggest problems with writing script is reusability. If you want to reuse your script, you 
can copy it from one HTML file to another, but if you have a lot of files in which you 
want to use this script, this task can be quite overwhelming. You can also place all 
your script in a separate file and include the file in an HTML file by using the SRC 
attribute of the &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tag. Although this approach will work in most respects, it 
doesn't allow you to easily attach event handlers to specific elements on the Web page, 
and it doesn't allow your script component to expose an object model of its own 
and fire events.
</P>

<P>
Once again, Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 comes to the rescue! One of its 
best new features is DHTML Behaviors&#8212;lightweight components that encapsulate 
specific functionality, or behavior, on a Web page. You can easily attach a DHTML 
Behavior (or Behavior, for short) to any HTML element on a Web page, thereby enhancing 
the element's default behavior. Because a Behavior's methods, properties, and 
events appear to be part of the HTML element to which the Behavior is attached, the 
Behavior extends the element's object model.
</P>

<P>
Furthermore, DHTML Behaviors allow you to separate the dynamic 
functionality of a Web page from its content and design, ensuring the integrity of a Web 
page&#8212;a critical advantage when the content author, designer, and engineer are all 
working independently on a Web site. Although cascading style sheets (CSS), which 
Internet Explorer 3 introduced a few years ago, allowed you to separate the design of a 
Web page from its content and dynamic functionality, you couldn't separate the 
dynamic functionality from the content.
</P>

<P>

DHTML Behaviors also make the dynamic functionality of your Web pages 
more manageable. To change the dynamic functionality, you have to change only the 
script that resides in the DHTML Behavior component instead of changing the script 
that resides on every single Web page. For example, the DHTML Ledger application 
discussed in <A HREF="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</A> is implemented entirely in DHTML and script. As you can 
see from the code on the companion CD, the amount of code is overwhelming! 
(The location for this code is \Samples\Chap03\DHTML Ledger.) Luckily, DHTML 
Behaviors allow you to remove script from the HTML document and place it in a 
separate component that you can attach to individual elements in the document and 
reuse across multiple pages. Using a DHTML Behavior, you need only one line of code 
to reuse the Ledger component, as shown here:
</P>

<P>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><TR><TD>
<PRE>
&lt;DIV ID=sheet1 STYLE=&quot;behavior:url(ledger.htc)&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
</PRE>
</td></tr></table></p>


<P>One line of code is much easier to deal with&#8212;wouldn't you agree? Along 
with making the page simpler to manage, Behaviors allow you to propagate changes 
to all pages that are using the DHTML Ledger Behavior, an example application 
that you'll see later in this chapter. You'll also learn about default Behaviors, using 
DHTML Behaviors created with HTCs, and Binary DHTML Behaviors. You'll have the 
opportunity to create your own Behaviors as well.</p>

<A NAME="275"><H1>Using Other Behavior Examples</H1></A>

<P>Many ready-made Behaviors are at your disposal. The MSDN Online Web Workshop provides a Behaviors library that contains lots of examples, including <I>calendar</I>, <I>coolbar</I>, <I>menu</I>, and <I>tooltip</I>. The Behaviors library is updated all the time, and it is available at this URL:<I> <A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/behaviors/library/behaviorslibrary.asp" TARGET="_window2">http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/behaviors/library/behaviorslibrary.asp</A>.</I></p>

<P>In addition to the examples that we've used in this chapter, two others that I haven't discussed are available on the companion CD in the folder \Samples\Chap11. The first is the table-of-contents builder Behavior, which is shown in Figure 11-5. It allows you to build a table of contents based on the headings on your Web page. When using this Behavior, you specify a HEADINGS<I> </I>attribute for the HTML element to which you are attaching the Behavior. The value of the HEADINGS<I> </I>attribute is a semicolon-separated list of the heading levels for which you want to create a table of contents. You can also specify other attributes such as the name that appears in the title bar of the table of contents window. To attach the table-of-contents builder Behavior to a &lt;DIV&gt; tag and to specify that a table of contents be built for all H1 and H2 tags, you would insert code into your Web page that looks like this:
</P>

<P>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><TR><TD>
<PRE>
&lt;DIV STYLE=&quot;behavior:url(Toc.htc)&quot; headings=&quot;H1;H2&quot; titlebar=&quot;Contents&quot;&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;
</PRE>
</td></tr></table></p>

</p>

<p>HTML Spy is another Behavior on the companion CD and is shown in 
Figure 116. An HTML Application that uses a Behavior to spy on the contents of a 
Web page, HTML Spy demonstrates a lot of the concepts that we've discussed in this 
book, including HTAs, the DHTML Object Model, mouse capture, and Behaviors.</p>

</p>

<p>To use HTML Spy, double-click htmlSpy.hta in Windows Explorer, or type its name at the command line. Either enter a URL in the HTML Spy's address bar after you launch this application or specify the URL via the command line when you launch it, and then press Enter. (This URL must be preceded by the correct protocol specifier: <I>http://</I>, <I>file://</I>, or some other.) Next click the Spy icon and, while keeping the left mouse button pressed, start moving the pointer over the client area of the target frame window (the window that contains the Web page to which you just navigated). As you hover over an HTML element, a ToolTip will display the element's <I>tagName</I> and identifiers.</p>

<p>Once you find an element of interest, release the left mouse button. 
Detailed information about the HTML element that you selected will be displayed in the 
right-hand window. The information that is displayed at the top of the right-hand 
window is a list of all attributes of the HTML element. Below the list of attributes is a 
hierarchy chart for that element with the element you selected highlighted in red letters. 
If you click on an item in this parent chain list with the left mouse button, the item 
will expand to show the item's immediate children.</p>

<p>Holding down the ALT key while clicking the left mouse button on an item 
in the parent chain list will display a complete list of all the item's children. The 
corresponding object for the item clicked will be highlighted in red letters in the 
target frame window. You can toggle the list by clicking or ALT-clicking the list again.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote><p><b>What's Next</b></p>
In this chapter, you created DHTML Behaviors implemented as HTCs and 
binary components. Now you know how valuable Behaviors can be to the 
development of Web sites. DHTML Behaviors allow you to separate the 
dynamic functionality from the content and design of your Web site. They also allow 
you to create components that you can reuse in the Web sites that you might 
build in the future.
<p>In the <a href="ch12a.htm">next chapter</a>, I'll introduce you to an Internet Explorer 
technology that can enhance the navigation experience of your users&#8212;Browser 
Helper Objects (BHOs). BHOs are DLLs you create that will attach themselves to 
every new instance of Internet Explorer.</p>

<P>In <A HREF="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</A>, which introduced the DHTML Object Model (formerly known as 
the Internet Explorer Object Model), you learned that all objects in the object model 
fit together in a way that enables you to access and change all HTML elements and 
data on a Web page. You also learned how to access the object model from JScript 
and Microsoft Visual Basic Script (VBScript). <A HREF="ch06a.htm">Chapter 6</A> showed you how to host 
the WebBrowser control and automate Microsoft Internet Explorer, and you saw 
that applications could do either and still access functionality (such as navigating 
forward and backward in a history list) in the same way.</P>

<P>As you'll see in this chapter, regardless of whether you are hosting the 
WebBrowser control or automating Internet Explorer, you also access the DHTML Object 
Model from your applications in the same way. You're going to learn how to access 
objects in the DHTML Object Model, as well as their methods, properties, events, 
and collections, from within Microsoft Visual Basic or Microsoft Visual C++ 
applications that are hosting the WebBrowser control or automating Internet Explorer.</P>

<P>As you learned in <A HREF="ch01a.htm">Chapter 1</A>, one of the most significant features introduced 
in Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 and expanded in Internet Explorer 5 is Dynamic 
HTML (DHTML). DHTML allows you to change the contents of a Web page on the 
fly&#8212;perhaps in response to some action from the user&#8212;without revisiting the server. 
You can use simple DHTML and script to accomplish the tasks that were previously 
only possible using Active Server Pages (ASP) or Common Gateway Interface (CGI) 
programs. Because you don't have to revisit the server to obtain additional 
information to display, you also don't have to display a new Web page each time your user 
enters data that requires validation or some sort of response. This increases your 
users' satisfaction when they're working with your Web application. It also allows your 
Web application to act more like a typical Microsoft Windows application.</P>
<P>Before I can explain all the cool features of DHTML (in <A HREF="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</A>), you 
must first understand basic HTML and programming in script, including Microsoft 
JScript and VBScript.</P>

<P>The best place for information about HTML is the MSDN Online Web 
Workshop: 
<I><A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop" TARGET="_window2">http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop</A></I>. Probably the best place for 
quick information about scripting is the Microsoft Scripting Technologies Web 
site: <I><A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting" TARGET="_window2">http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting</A></I>. If you don't find what you need 
there, check out the Microsoft Press Web site:

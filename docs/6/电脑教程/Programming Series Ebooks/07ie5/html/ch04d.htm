<A NAME="119"><H1>More HTA Examples</H1></A>

<p>Now that you can create your own HTML Applications by using only DHTML 
and script, let's look at two more HTA examples. These examples really show off 
the power of HTA. You've already seen some versions of these examples in <A HREF="ch03a.htm">Chapter 
3</a>: a text editor named DHTML Memo and a spreadsheet named DHTML Ledger. 
For this chapter, I converted these examples to HTML Applications and named them 
Memo and Ledger. The Memo application is shown in Figure 4-5, 
and the Ledger application is shown in Figure 4-6.</p>

<p>The code for Memo and Ledger is basically the same as the code for 
their DHTML counterparts in <A HREF="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</A>, so I won't show it here. But unlike their 
DHTML counterparts, the HTA versions of these applications allow you to open and save files.</p>

<p>To start and then run the applications, simply double-click the Memo.hta 
file or double-click the Ledger.hta file. You can open new Memo files or Ledger files 
by clicking the Open button on the toolbar. I've included a few sample files on the 
companion CD for Memo in the folder \Samples\Chap04\Memo and sample files for 
Ledger in the folder \Samples\Chap04\Ledger. The Memo sample files have the 
extension .mem, and the Ledger sample files have the extension .lgr.</p>

<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
An ActiveX control is used to display the open and save dialog 
boxes and to perform the actual opening and saving of the files. (In <A HREF="ch05a.htm">Chapter 5</A>, 
you'll create your own ActiveX controls.) Therefore, before you can use one of 
these applications, you must register the OpenSave.dll file in the OpenSave 
directory by using the Regsvr32 application, like this:

<p><table><TR><TD>
<PRE>regsvr32 OpenSave.dll 
</PRE>
</td></tr></table></p>

The Regsvr32 application resides in the \Windows\System directory on 
Windows 95 and later versions and in the \WinNT\System32 directory on Windows 
NT systems.

</p>

<p>When you're ready to save a file, just click the Save button on the toolbar. 
When you click the Open button or the Save button, each application will display the 
Open dialog box or the Save dialog box, respectively. Pretty easy, huh? But you 
already knew that it would be.</p>

<p><b>What's Next?</b></p>
<p>In this chapter, you learned how to create full-fledged Windows 
applications by using only DHTML and script. How much simpler can development get? 
In the <a href="ch05a.htm">next chapter</a>, you'll create and use ActiveX controls on your Web pages. 
The concepts we'll discuss also apply to HTML Applications.</p>

<p>I encourage you to start using HTAs when you need to create 
Windows applications. You'll probably find them much easier to create than their 
Visual C++ and Visual Basic counterparts.</p>

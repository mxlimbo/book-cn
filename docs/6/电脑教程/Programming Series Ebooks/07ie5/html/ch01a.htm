<P>Since the dawn of the computer age, people have searched for ways to make 
computers easier to use. Initially, text-based terminals provided the primary link 
between users and their computing applications. Despite developers' best attempts to 
simplify this interface, it took a hacker&#8212;someone in love with the technology&#8212;to find 
satisfaction in working with it. Users weren't able to interact with their applications in 
a meaningful, intuitive way until the advent of point-and-click operating systems 
such as Microsoft Windows. The mouse and the graphical user interface (GUI) 
revolutionized the way the world thought about computing and made computers accessible 
and enjoyable for millions of people.</P>

<P>The popularity of the Internet and the World Wide Web brought 
computer usability to a new level. Through a series of hyperlinks, users could navigate 
from one page of information (a Web page) to the next. The only problem with these 
pages was that information on them was static&#8212;users couldn't interact with the 
information in the same way they could in Microsoft Windows applications. To fulfill the 
users' need to interact, forms were introduced in HTML 2. Using HTML forms, users 
could send information to the owners of a Web page. With two-way traffic possible on 
the Web, the path was paved for Internet applications.</P>

<P>Over time, computers have become simpler to operate, but with this ease 
of use has come internal complexity. The more a computer program is designed 
to anticipate the user's needs, the more it requires complex logic, convoluted 
graphic rendering, and subroutine piled on top of subroutine&#8212;challenges for the 
designers and developers of such a program. Developing applications for the Internet, 
however, hasn't followed this trend. As tasks have become easier for the users, they 
have also become easier for the designers and developers.</P>

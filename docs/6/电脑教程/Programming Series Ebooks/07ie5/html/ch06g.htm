<P>Now that you know how to create extraordinary applications using the 
WebBrowser control and Internet Explorer, you are probably wondering which Internet 
Explorer components you need to ship with your application so that your application is 
guaranteed to work correctly on systems that might not have Internet Explorer 5 
installed. Whether you are hosting the WebBrowser control or automating Internet 
Explorer, you must ship at least the minimal install of Internet Explorer. To understand 
why, look again at the architecture diagram shown in Figure 6-1. You can 
see how each component depends on the other&#8212;and this diagram reveals only the 
surface. It does not show the multitude of components involved in providing all 
the features of the WebBrowser control and Internet Explorer. Because there are so 
many components involved, you must ensure that your users have at least the minimal 
install of Internet Explorer for your applications to work.</p>

<p>Don't worry&#8212;you don't have to ship each and every component of 
Internet Explorer. The Internet Explorer 5 installation program allows you to customize 
your installation so that you ship only those components that are absolutely 
necessary. In addition, if you use the Internet Explorer Administration Kit (available at 
<I><A HREF="http://ieak.microsoft.com" TARGET="_window2">http://ieak.microsoft.com</A></I>/) to build your installation program, you can install 
Internet Explorer silently so that your users are not pestered with a multitude of 
dialog boxes asking them to confirm different steps in the installation process.</p>


<P><DIV CLASS="sidebar"><BLOCKQUOTE><p><b>What's Next</b></p>
In this chapter, I showed you how easy it is to host the WebBrowser 
control and automate Internet Explorer in Visual Basic and Visual C++ 
applications. I showed you the different methods and properties of the WebBrowser that 
provide you with just about everything you need to create extraordinary 
Web applications. In the <a href="ch07a.htm">next chapter</a>, I will show you a feature of the 
WebBrowser control and Internet Explorer that gives you ultimate control&#8212;events. 
You'll learn about the different events of the WebBrowser and how easy it is to 
use them to control navigation, use your application for any new windows that 
are created, and know when to enable and disable Back and Forward buttons, 
plus a whole lot more.

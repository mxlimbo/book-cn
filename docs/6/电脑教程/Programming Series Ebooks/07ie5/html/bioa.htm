<A NAME="1"><H1>About the Author</H1></A>
<P>Scott Roberts has been a developer for about nine years, and during that time 
he has created many different applications and systems, including telephony 
applications, point-of-sale applications, and communications and controls systems. In 
July of 1997, Scott was hired by Microsoft as a developer support engineer for 
the Internet Client Developer Support Team. He assisted 
customers who were using Microsoft Internet Explorer to 
build Microsoft Visual C++ and Microsoft Visual Basic applications, Microsoft ActiveX controls, DHTML Applications, and so 
on. Scott's specialties included the WebBrowser control, the advanced hosting 
interfaces, COM, ATL, and C++. Also the content lead for Internet Client 
Development, he helped to initiate the Technical Assistance area of the MSDN 
Online Web Workshop. Currently Scott is a contributing editor for 
<I>MIND</I> magazine; with the help of Joshua Trupin (also with 
<I>MIND</I>), Scott started the magazine's FAQ column. This column features articles from developer support engineers 
about common customer issues.</p>
<P>Scott recently moved over to the development side of Internet 
Explorer and is now a software design engineer on the Trident Object Model Team. 
He writes code for the WebBrowser control, HTML applications, the DHTML 
Object Model, and other aspects of the MSHTML component of Internet 
Explorer. Scott hopes to help customers behind the scenes by writing solid code for 
future versions of Internet Explorer.</p>
<P>Scott is also a joint author of <I>C++ 
How-To</I> (SAMS Publishing, 1998).</p>
<P>Scott was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, spent some time in the Bay Area, 
and now lives in Redmond, Washington, with his wife Andrea. Scott and Andrea 
are expecting their first child and are very busy preparing for the new addition 
to their family, who should be born by the time this book hits the stores.</p>

<P>In previous chapters, you took advantage of Microsoft Internet Explorer 
functionality either by hosting the WebBrowser control or by automating Internet 
Explorer. Reusing Internet Explorer technology in either of those ways is great because 
each gives you ultimate control over all aspects of Internet Explorer, including 
browsing and the user interface.</P>

<P>But what if you want to enhance the browser without creating your own 
hosting application or automating Internet Explorer? Suppose you want the Tip Of The 
Day to be displayed in the browser when users start Internet Explorer so that they can 
learn how to use its features as time goes on. Or perhaps you want to create a calculator 
application that users can start with the click of a button. Such an application could 
assist staff in your accounting department or people who shop online. To implement this 
functionality without having to create your own browser application or automate 
Internet Explorer, you can use new technology known as Web Accessories.</P>

<P>What are Web Accessories, you ask? They are extensions to Internet 
Explorer that you can create to enhance your users' browsing experience. Web 
Accessories can be basic Web content that you create by using standard HTML, DHTML, and 
script, or full-blown COM-based applications written in Microsoft Visual C++ or 
Microsoft Visual Basic.</P>
<P>To build Web Accessories, you use browser extensions. A browser 
extension might be a menu item or a toolbar button that you create and add to Internet 
Explorer and that, when selected, executes your application. Or it might be an Explorer 
Bar similar to the Internet Explorer Search band or Favorites band (see Figure 10-1 
and Figure 10-2). This new terminology might seem a bit 
confusing, but it's really quite simple: Web Accessories are browser enhancements to 
Internet Explorer that developers can create by using browser extensions.</P>

<P>In this chapter, I will show you how to create Web Accessories using the 
four different types of browser extensions: Explorer Bars, toolbar buttons, main 
menu items, and context menu items.</P>

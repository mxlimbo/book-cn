<A NAME="9"><H1>Internet Explorer 4</H1></A>

<P>All this new programmability included with Internet Explorer 3 brought us one 
step closer to creating full-blown Web applications that were as good as 
Windows applications, but they still weren't quite up to par with their Windows-based 
cousins. Thus, Internet Explorer 4 was developed. (See Figure 1-4.) Version 4, 
released on September 30, 1997, provided huge advances in programmability and 
reusability. This version introduced lots of new features, many of which we'll be 
discussing in detail in this book.</P>

<A NAME="10"><H2>Dynamic HTML</H2></A>

<P>Internet Explorer 3 allowed you to determine what to display on a Web page 
as Internet Explorer was rendering it. However, once the page was finished loading, 
you couldn't change what was displayed without accessing the server again to obtain 
the updated information.</P>

<P>Version 4 of Internet Explorer introduced Dynamic HTML (DHTML). 
DHTML provided enhancements to the Internet Explorer 
Object Model&#8212;now called the DHTML Object Model&#8212;that enabled you to change the content of a Web page 
after the page finished loading. In <A HREF="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</A>, you'll see how to use DHTML in 
combination with script to dynamically change the contents of a Web page.</P>

<A NAME="11"><H2>Data Binding</H2></A>

<P>One of the most significant features that Internet Explorer 4 introduced as part 
of DHTML was data binding. If you've ever worked with Visual Basic, you can 
understand what this means for programmability. Data binding lets you attach, or bind, 
an HTML element on a Web page to data in a database. Any time data in that 
database is changed, the information contained in that bound HTML element is changed 
on the fly, without your browser having to visit the server and load another Web 
page. Also, data binding allows you to update the data in a database without the 
hassles of submitting a normal HTML form.</P>

<P>As an example, let's say you're working with Microsoft Excel. Excel gives 
you the ability to bind your spreadsheet to a database table so that changes made to 
the values in the database will be reflected in your spreadsheet on the fly and vice 
versa. Prior to Internet Explorer 4, you could actually do this from an HTML Web page. 
To update the database or refresh the values contained in the fields in a table, the 
user had to click a Submit button so that the Web page could make a round-trip to 
the Internet server. With data binding support in Internet Explorer 4, it was no 
longer necessary to visit the server and load a new Web page. The information on a 
Web page could be changed dynamically to reflect the current state of data in the 
database. Data binding brought Internet Explorer another step closer to becoming a 
full-fledged development platform. Data binding is one of those topics that could 
take up many chapters, perhaps even an entire volume. For that reason, I will not be 
talking about it in this book. For more information, refer to the documentation on the 
MSDN Online Web Workshop:

<A NAME="12"><H2>WebBrowser Control Enhancements</H2></A>

<P>Although the WebBrowser control was introduced in Internet Explorer 3, version 
4 added several features to it. As well as providing new functionality relative to 
hosting the control, Internet Explorer 4 introduced features that allowed you to 
control some aspects of the browser that you couldn't control before. (The 
WebBrowser control is covered in more detail in <A HREF="ch06a.htm">Chapter 6</A> and later chapters.)</P>

<A NAME="13"><H2>Explorer Bars</H2></A>

<P>Internet Explorer 4 introduced a new user interface feature named Explorer 
Bars. These bars look like frames on a Web page but are linked to the browser and not 
to a particular Web page. Two types of Explorer Bars exist: the Explorer band and 
the Communication band. The Explorer band is the most common. It appears 
vertically inside the browser. Internet Explorer 4 offered four default Explorer bands: the 
Search band (Figure 1-5), the Favorites band (Figure 1-6), the History band (Figure 1-7), 
and the Channels band (Figure 1-8). They all appear vertically on the left-hand side 
of Internet Explorer's main window. Internet Explorer 5 doesn't contain the 
Channels band; instead, it contains the Folders band. For details about the Folders band, 
refer to <A HREF="ch10a.htm">Chapter 10</A>.</P>

<P>The second type of Explorer Bar, the Communication band&#8212;or Comm 
band&#8212;is displayed horizontally at the bottom of Internet Explorer's main window. 
Internet Explorer 4 and later versions also install the Desk band, which is attached to the 
Active Desktop. See <A HREF="ch10a.htm">Chapter 10</A> for more information on this band. Unfortunately, Internet Explorer 4 didn't provide any default Comm or Desk bands, but it did give you the ability to create your own Explorer Bars and the Desk band that were attached to the browser or the desktop. You'll create your own Explorer Bars and the Desk 
band in Chapter 10.</P>

<A NAME="14"><H2>Browser Helper Objects</H2></A>

<P>When you create a Web application for Internet Explorer, it's often helpful to 
know when a user starts up the browser so that you can track Web page statistics. Or 
perhaps you want to use Internet Explorer on your corporate intranet, and you want 
to restrict navigation to certain Web sites. There were no easy solutions to this 
problem in Internet Explorer 1 or 2. And in version 3 of Internet Explorer, the only 
solution to either of these scenarios was to create your own Web browser and host 
the WebBrowser control. With Internet Explorer 4, you could use a new 
programmability and reusability feature known as Browser Helper Objects (BHOs). BHOs are 
COM objects that Internet Explorer automatically creates whenever a user starts a 
new instance of Internet Explorer. Using BHOs, you can hook into the browser to 
control navigation or to dynamically change the content of a Web page. <A HREF="ch12a.htm">Chapter 12</A> 
covers BHOs in more detail.</P>

<A NAME="108"><H1>Examples: DHTML Memo and DHTML Ledger</H1></A>

<P>Now that you're an expert DHTML programmer, let's look at some examples 
that demonstrate the kind of web-based applications you can create using only 
DHTML and script. These are real-world examples&#8212;not like the simple examples I've 
shown you so far. The first is a DHTML Memo example, which acts almost exactly 
like Microsoft Notepad but runs in the context of a Web page. When you open 
DHTML Memo, you'll see a Web page that contains an editing window in which you can 
type in a document. Take a look at Figure 3-7.</P>

<P>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F03ii07x.htm')"> <img src="images/F03ii07.JPG" width=404 height=332 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</P><P>
<!-- caption --><B>Figure 3-7.</B> <I>DHTML Memo.</I><!-- /caption -->
</P>

<P>In Figure 3-7, the DHTML Memo window has a title bar with 
Minimize/Restore, Maximize/Restore, and Exit buttons like a typical Windows application window. 
You can even move the editing window around on the page by clicking the title bar 
and then dragging it. Unlike Windows Notepad, DHTML Memo has a toolbar that you 
can use to change the font face, size, and color, and to change the text to bold, italic, 
or underline. All changes made using this toolbar effect the entire document. 
However, you can modify the code so that changes made using the toolbar affect only 
the selected text or the text that's typed after a change is made. I'll leave these 
modifications as exercises for you.</P>
<P>DHTML Memo's best part is that it's all written in DHTML and script! No C, 
C++, Microsoft Visual Basic, or Java code is used at all. Give this sample a try by 
loading the DMemo.htm file from the companion CD. I think you'll be impressed.</P>
<P>The second example application is DHTML Ledger, which is shown in 
Figure 3-8. The window of this ledger looks similar to the window in a normal Windows 
spreadsheet application such as Microsoft Excel.</P>

<P>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F03ii08x.htm')"> <img src="images/F03ii08.JPG" width=404 height=260 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</P><P>
<!-- caption --><B>Figure 3-8.</B> <I>DHTML Ledger.</I><!-- /caption -->
</P>

<P>The DHTML Ledger window offers some of the same functionality as the 
DHTML Memo window: it has a title bar and Minimize/Restore, Maximize/Restore, and 
Exit buttons, and you can drag the window around inside Internet Explorer. This 
spreadsheet allows you to enter each value into a cell. Also, you can enter a formula 
into a cell by using the Expression Builder. To use the Expression Builder, enter 
some values in a few cells, click on an empty cell, and then click the 
<I>fx </I>button in the top left corner of the ledger window.</P>
<P>The <I>fx</I> button invokes the DHTML Expression Builder-Web Page Dialog 
dialog box by calling the <I>showModalDialog </I>method, as shown in Figure 3-9. Follow 
the instructions in the dialog box to specify one or more cells in the text box.</P>

<P>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F03ii09x.htm')"> <img src="images/F03ii09.JPG" width=404 height=297 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</P><P>
<!-- caption --><B>Figure 3-9.</B> <I>DHTML Expression Builder-Web Page Dialog dialog box.</I><!-- /caption -->
</P>

<P>If you specify only one cell, you can take its inverse or square it by selecting 
a function from the drop-down list. If you specify two cells, you can add, multiply, 
or average the values in the cells. (Subtraction and division are left as exercises for 
you.) If you specify a range of cells, you can sum or average the values of the cells. 
After you click the OK button, a <I>dynamic </I>property is inserted into the cell that you 
clicked on before invoking the Expression Builder. The 
<I>dynamic </I>property is inserted using the <I>setExpression 
</I>method. Because a <I>dynamic </I>property is used, updating any of 
the source cells updates the value in the destination cell.</P>
<P>Try out the DHTML Ledger example, and I'm sure you'll be even more 
impressed than you were with DHTML Memo. The best part is, just like DHTML Memo, 
this DHTML spreadsheet was written entirely using DHTML and script. You can find 
the sample (named DLedger.htm) on the companion CD. Because of Internet 
Explorer's security limitations, the only task you can't perform with these applications is 
saving files to your hard drive. In <A HREF="ch11a.htm">Chapter 11</A>, I'll show you how to write 
real-world applications like these that also allow you to save files to disk.</P>

Now that you see how easily you can create applications using 
DHTML and script, I bet you're ready to start converting all the applications 
you've written to applications using DHTML and script, or to start writing new 
applications using the techniques discussed in this chapter. You're probably 
wondering whether creating applications using DHTML and script can get any 
better than this. Guess what? It can, and it will. Just as the discussion of HTML 
and script in <A HREF="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</A> laid the groundwork for this chapter, the overview of 
DHTML in this chapter lays the groundwork for what we're going to discuss in the 
rest of this book, including creating ActiveX controls, hosting the 
WebBrowser control, accessing the DHTML object model from your Visual Basic and 
Microsoft Visual C++ applications, and developing HTML applications. Get ready, 
because here we go!

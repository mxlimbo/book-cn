<A NAME="227"><H1>Understanding Explorer Bars and Desk Bands</H1></A>

<P><A HREF="ch01a.htm">Chapter 1</A> provides an overview of Explorer Bars, but let's review that 
information again now. Explorer Bars are child windows that are parented by the Internet 
Explorer browser window. When you start an Explorer Bar, the bar appears inside 
the browser window either vertically or horizontally. Vertical Explorer Bars are 
known as Explorer bands, and horizontal Explorer Bars are known as Communication 
bands, or simply Comm bands. You will also work with Desk bands, which are a 
technology included with the shell that is installed by Microsoft Windows 98 and 2000. 
(Desk bands are also installed by Internet Explorer 4 and later versions when you 
install the desktop update.)</P>

<A NAME="228"><H2>Explorer Bands</H2></A>

<P>Internet Explorer 5 automatically installs four different vertical Explorer Bars 
(also referred to as Explorer bands): Search, Favorites, History, and Folders.</P>

<!-- caption --><B>Figure 10-1.</B> <I>Search band.</I><!-- /caption -->
</P>

<P>The Search band, shown in Figure 10-1, allows you to quickly access your 
favorite search site, such as Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, and so forth. You can easily 
customize which search engines are available by clicking the Customize button in 
the Search band and then making your selections. You start the Search band by 
clicking the Search button on the Internet Explorer toolbar or by selecting Search from 
the View/Explorer Bar menu.</P>
<P>The Favorites band, shown in Figure 10-2, allows you to view, select, and 
organize your favorite URLs by clicking the Add button and the Organize button 
provided in the band. The Favorites band provides easy access to your favorite URLs; you 
don't have to choose the URLs from the Favorites menu. You start the band by clicking 
the Favorites button on the Internet Explorer toolbar or by selecting Favorites from 
the View/Explorer Bar menu.</P>

<!-- caption --><B>Figure 10-2.</B> <I>Favorites band.</I><!-- /caption -->
</P>

<P>Figure 10-3 shows the History band, which allows 
you to view URLs that you have previously visited. From this band, you can open or 
delete an item in the history list or add it to your favorites. You can start this Explorer 
band by clicking the History button on the Internet Explorer toolbar or by selecting 
History from the View/Explorer Bar menu, just as you would to start the Search 
and Favorites bands.</P>

<!-- caption --><B>Figure 10-3.</B> <I>History band.</I><!-- /caption -->
</P>


<P>The last Explorer band that Internet Explorer 5 installs for you is the 
Folders band, as shown in Figure 10-4. It allows you to navigate to different folders on 
your system or on the network, just as you would if you were using Microsoft 
Windows Explorer. Unlike the other Explorer bands, the Folders band doesn't have a 
button on the Internet Explorer toolbar by default, but you can add a button for it by 
right-clicking the Internet Explorer toolbar and choosing Customize. As an alternative, 
you can select the Folders band from the View/Explorer Bar menu.</P>

<A NAME="229"><H2>Comm Bands</H2></A>

<P>Internet Explorer 5 installs one default horizontal Explorer Bar (also known as 
the Comm band): Tip Of The Day. Another Comm band, the Discuss band, is 
installed with Office 2000 and allows you to participate in discussions with others about a 
Web page. You can add remarks to the Web page, edit and reply to existing remarks, 
and so on.</P>

<P>The Tip Of The Day Comm band (shown at the bottom of the screen in 
Figure 10-5) provides handy, daily tips that help you learn more about using 
Internet Explorer. As a matter of fact, as I was writing this book and testing out the Tip 
Of The Day band, I learned that you can press Alt-D to move the cursor to the 
Address bar. I encourage you to give the Tip Of The Day band a try. The tips are 
quite informative.</P>

<A NAME="230"><H2>Desk Bands</H2></A>

<P>As I mentioned, Desk bands are installed by Internet Explorer 4 and later 
versions as part of the shell that is installed with Windows 98 and Windows 2000 when 
you install the desktop update. You can create Desk bands in much the same way 
you create Explorer Bars.</P>

<P>Instead of being connected to the Internet Explorer window as Explorer 
Bars are, Desk bands are connected to the desktop, and you can use them only if you 
have activated the Active Desktop. You start Desk bands by right-clicking the Active 
Desktop task bar and selecting the Desk band from the Toolbars submenu.</P>

<P><DIV CLASS="NOTE"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE</B><HR>The terminology might seem a little confusing. Just remember 
that Explorer Bars are the technology that includes Explorer bands and Comm 
bands. Desk bands are a technology in and of themselves. Also, you'll sometimes 
hear Explorer Bars and Desk bands referred to as band objects, so don't be 
confused. I'll use the term Explorer Bar when referring to Explorer bands and Comm 
bands, but I'll use the term <I>band object</I> when referring to all three.

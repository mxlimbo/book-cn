<p>After you run through all the pages of the wizard, you'll have a project that you can
use to finish crafting your driver. Because of limitations on the custom wizard support in
Visual C++, you'll need to add some project settings by hand. Please refer to WDMBOOK.HTM
on the companion disc for a description of these settings.</p>

<p>The generated code will contain a number of TODO comments that highlight areas where you
need to write some code. I suggest you use the Find In Files command to locate these items.</p>

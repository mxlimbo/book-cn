<p>Many kinds of drivers form a complete Windows 2000 system. Figure 1-4 diagrams several of
them.</p>

<ul>
<p><li> A <i>virtual device driver</i> (VDD) is a user-mode component that allows DOS-based
applications to access hardware on x86 platforms. A VDD relies on the I/O permission mask to
trap port access, and it essentially simulates the operation of hardware for the benefit of
applications that were originally programmed to talk directly to hardware on a bare machine.
Although this kind of driver shares a name and a purpose with a kind of driver used in Windows
98, it's a different animal altogether. We use the acronym VDD for this kind of driver and
the acronym VxD for the Windows 98 driver to distinguish the two.</li></p>

<p><li> The category of <i>kernel-mode drivers</i> includes many subcategories. A <i>PnP
driver</i> is a kernel-mode driver that understands the Plug and Play (PnP) protocols of
Windows 2000. To be perfectly accurate, this book concerns PnP drivers and nothing else.</li></p>

<p><li> A <i>WDM driver</i> is a PnP driver that also understands power management protocols and
is source-compatible with both Windows 98 and Windows

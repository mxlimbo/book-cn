<A NAME="30"><H1>Basic Structure ofç‡¼ WDM Driver </H1></A>

<p>In the first chapter, I described the basic architecture of the Microsoft Windows 2000 and
Microsoft Windows 98 operating systems. I introduced the idea that a device driver is a
container for a collection of subroutines that the operating system can call upon to carry out
various activities related to a hardware device. This chapter is about the basic contents of
one of those driver containers. I'll discuss how device drivers are layered and how that
layering comes about. I'll also discuss the DriverEntry and AddDevice functions that every
WDM driver includes. In later chapters, I'll tell you about the other types of subroutines
that will be part of the driver for your device.</p>

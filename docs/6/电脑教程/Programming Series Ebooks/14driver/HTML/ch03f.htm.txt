<p>In the remainder of this chapter, I'm going to discuss some miscellaneous topics that
might be useful in various parts of your driver. I'll begin by describing how you access
the registry database, which is where you can find various configuration and control
information that might affect your code or your hardware. I'll go on to describe how you
access disk files and other named devices. A few words will suffice to describe how you can
perform floating-point calculations in a WDM driver. Finally, I'll describe a few of the
features you can embed in your driver to make it easier to debug your driver in the unlikely

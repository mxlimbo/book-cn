<p>Writing a WDM driver is fundamentally an exercise in software engineering. Whatever the
requirements of your particular hardware, you will combine various elements to form a program.
In the <a href="ch02a.htm">previous chapter</a>, I described the basic structure of a WDM driver, and I showed you two
of its elements&#8212;DriverEntry and AddDevice&#8212;in detail. In this chapter, I'll focus
on the even more basic topic of how you call upon the large body of kernel-mode support
routines that the operating system exposes for your use. I'll discuss error handling,
memory and data structure management, registry and file access, and a few other topics.
I'll round out the chapter with a short discussion of the steps you can take to help debug
your driver.</p>

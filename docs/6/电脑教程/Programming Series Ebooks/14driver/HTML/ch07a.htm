<p>All the infrastructure I've described so far in this book leads up to this chapter,
where I finally cover how to read and write data from a device. I'll discuss the service
functions you call to perform these important operations on a device plugged in to one of the
traditional buses, such as PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect). Since many devices use a
hardware interrupt to notify system software about I/O completion or exceptional events,
I'll also discuss how to handle an interrupt. Interrupt processing normally requires you to
schedule a deferred procedure call (DPC), so I'll describe the DPC mechanism, too. Finally,
I'll tell you how to arrange direct memory access (DMA) transfers between your device and
main memory.</p>

<p>Some devices won't notify you when something goes wrong&#8212;they simply don't
respond when you talk to them. Each device object has an associated IO_TIMER object that you
can use to avoid indefinitely waiting for an operation to finish. While the timer is running,
the I/O Manager will call a timer callback routine once a second. Within the timer callback
routine, you can take steps to terminate any outstanding operations that should have finished
but didn't.</p>

<p>You initialize the timer object at AddDevice time:</p>

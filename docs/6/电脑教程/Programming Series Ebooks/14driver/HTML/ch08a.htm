<A NAME="265"><H1>Power Management </H1></A>

<p>Technophobes may take solace in the fact that they retain ultimate control over their
electronic servants so long as they control the power switch. Power is, of course, the sine qua
non of computing, but personal computers haven't done an especially good job of managing it
until quite recently.</p>

<p>More effective power management is important for at least three reasons. First, as a matter
of sound ecology, using less power helps to minimize the impact of computing on the
environment. Not only do computers require power, but so do the air-conditioning systems for
the rooms where the computers reside. A second reason better power management is needed is
familiar to many travelers: battery technology simply hasn't kept pace with the demand for
mobile computing of all kinds. And, finally, greater consumer acceptance of PCs as home
appliances depends on improving power management. Current machines have noisy fans and
squealing disk drives when they're on, and they take a long time to start up from the
power-off state. Decreasing the power-up latency and eliminating unnecessary noise&#8212;which
also means minimizing power consumption so that less cooling is required&#8212;will be necessary
before PCs can comfortably occupy consumer niches.</p>

<p>In this chapter, I'll discuss the role WDM drivers play in power management in the
Microsoft Windows 2000 and Microsoft Windows 98 operating systems. The first major section of
the chapter, &quot;<A HREF="ch08b.htm#266">The WDM Power Model</A>,&quot; presents an overview of the concepts you need to
know about. The second section, &quot;<A HREF="ch08c.htm#271">Managing Power Transitions</A>,&quot; is the meat of the
chapter: I'll describe there the very complicated tasks a typical function driver carries
out. I'll finish the chapter with a discussion of some ancillary responsibilities a WDM
function driver has with respect to power management.</p>

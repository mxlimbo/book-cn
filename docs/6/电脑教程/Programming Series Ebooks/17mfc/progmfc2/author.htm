<P>Today Jeff spends his working hours writing books about programming and articles for <I>PC Magazine</I> and <I>Microsoft Systems Journal</I>, teaching MFC programming and COM programming classes through David Solomon Expert Seminars, providing consulting services for companies who write Windows software, and developing software of his own.

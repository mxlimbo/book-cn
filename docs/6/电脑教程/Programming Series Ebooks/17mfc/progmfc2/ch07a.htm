<A NAME="174"><H1>Controls</H1></A>

<P>One of the ingredients found in the recipe for nearly every successful Microsoft 
Windows application is the control. A 
<I>control</I> is a special kind of window designed 
to convey information to the user or to acquire input. Most controls appear in 
dialog boxes, but they work just fine in top-level windows and other nondialog 
windows, too. The push button is one example of a control; the edit control&#8212;a simple 
rectangle for entering and editing text&#8212;is another.</P>

<P>Controls reduce the tedium of Windows programming and promote a 
consistent user interface by providing canned implementations of common user 
interface elements. Controls are prepackaged objects that come complete with their own 
window procedures. An application that uses a push button control doesn't have to 
draw the push button on the screen and process mouse messages to know when the 
push button is clicked. Instead, it creates the push button with a simple function call 
and receives notifications whenever the push button is clicked. The control's 
WM_PAINT handler paints the push button on the screen, and other message handlers inside 
the control translate user input into notification messages.</P>

<P>Controls are sometimes referred to as <I>child window 
controls</I> because of the parent-child relationships that they share with other windows. Unlike 
top-level windows, which have no parents, controls are child windows that are parented 
to other windows. A child window moves when its parent moves, is 
automatically destroyed when its parent is destroyed, and is clipped to its parent's window 
rectangle. And when a control transmits a notification message signifying an input 
event, its parent is the recipient of that message.</P>

<P>Current versions of Windows come with more than 20 types of controls. 
Six, which we'll refer to as the <I>classic 
controls</I>, have been around since the first 
version of Windows and are implemented in User.exe. The others, which are 
collectively known as the <I>common controls,</I> are relatively new to Windows (most debuted 
in Windows 95) and are implemented in Comctl32.dll. This chapter introduces the 
classic controls and the MFC classes that encapsulate them. The common controls are 
covered in <a href="ch16a.htm">Chapter 16</a>.</P>

<A NAME="1"><H1>Hello, MFC</H1></A>

<P>A few short years ago, the person learning to program Microsoft Windows for 
the first time had a limited number of programming tools to choose from. C was the 
language spoken by the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK), and 
alternative Windows programming environments such as Microsoft Visual Basic hadn't 
arrived on the scene. Most Windows applications were written in C, and the fledgling 
Windows programmer faced the daunting task not only of learning the ins and outs of a 
new operating system but also of getting acquainted with the hundreds of different 
application programming interface (API) functions that Windows supports.
</p>

<P>Today many Windows programs are still written in C. But the variety of 
Windows programming environments available means that commercial-quality Windows 
programs can be written in C, C++, Pascal, BASIC, and a number of other 
languages. Moreover, C++ has all but replaced C as the professional Windows 
programmer's language of choice because the sheer complexity of Windows, coupled with the 
wide-ranging scope of the Windows API, cries out for an object-oriented 
programming language. Many Windows programmers have concluded that C++ offers a 
compelling alternative to C that, combined with a class library that abstracts the API 
and encapsulates the basic behavior of windows and other objects in reusable 
classes, makes Windows programming simpler. And an overwhelming majority of C++ 
programmers have settled on the Microsoft Foundation Class library, better known 
by the acronym MFC, as their class library of choice. Other Windows class libraries 
are available, but only MFC was written by the company that writes the operating 
system. MFC is continually updated to incorporate the latest changes to Windows 
itself, and it provides a comprehensive set of classes representing everything from 
windows to ActiveX controls in order to make the job of writing Windows applications easier.
</p>

<P>If you're coming to MFC from a traditional Windows programming 
environment such as C and the Windows SDK, you're already familiar with many of the 
concepts you need to know to understand Windows programming with MFC. But if 
you're coming from a character-oriented environment such as MS-DOS or UNIX, you'll 
find that Windows programming is fundamentally different from anything you've 
done before. This chapter begins with an overview of the Windows programming 
model and a peek under the hood at how Windows applications work. It continues with 
an introduction to MFC. After the preliminaries are out of the way, you'll develop 
your very first Windows application&#8212;one that uses MFC to create a resizeable 
window containing the message &quot;Hello, MFC.&quot;

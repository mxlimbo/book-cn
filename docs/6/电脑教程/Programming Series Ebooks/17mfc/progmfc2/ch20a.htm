<A NAME="616"><H1>Automation</H1></A>


<p>Imagine a world in which you could program any Microsoft Windows 
application using a sophisticated yet easy-to-use scripting language. Imagine further that all 
scripting languages were the same so that once you learned to write scripts for one 
application, you could write scripts for others, too. While you're at it, consider how 
useful it would be if programs written in Microsoft Visual C++, Microsoft Visual Basic, 
and other programming languages could also access the features exposed to this 
hypothetical language.</P>

<p>Sound too good to be true? It's not. Thanks to the COM-based technology 
known as Automation, any MFC application can be turned into a scriptable 
application. Automation is a standardized means for exposing an application's features to 
clients written in Visual Basic; Visual Basic for Applications (VBA); Visual Basic, 
Scripting Edition (VBScript); and other languages. It solves the problem posed by these 
languages' inability to talk to COM objects using conventional COM interfaces, but it 
isn't restricted to dialects of Visual Basic; clients written in C++ and other languages 
can also use Automation.</P>

<p>Microsoft is actively encouraging application developers to build 
Automation support into their programs and has led the way by building Automation 
capabilities into many of its flagship applications. Microsoft Excel, for example, is a 
powerful Automation server. So are Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, and other 
Microsoft Office applications. By exposing an application's feature set through Automation, 
you make that application a powerful tool in the hands of users who are willing to 
learn a scripting language. You also give developers the means to use your application 
as a platform for building their own applications.</P>

<p>Automation is a versatile tool with talents that extend beyond mere 
scripting. It's also used to build software components for Active Server Pages, and it's one 
of the key technologies employed by ActiveX controls. In this chapter, you'll learn 
what Automation is, how it works, and how you can use MFC to write 
Automation-enabled applications. A Visual C++ programmer can have a simple Automation server up 
and running in no time flat. With a little know-how, you can build Automation 
servers that expose complex, hierarchically structured object models. Visual C++ and 
MFC also simplify the creation of Automation clients&#8212;programs that use the services 
provided by Automation servers.</P>

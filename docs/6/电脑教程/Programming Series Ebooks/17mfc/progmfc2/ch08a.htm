<A NAME="209"><H1>Dialog Boxes and Property Sheets</H1></A>


<P>In the real world, most controls appear not in top-level windows but in dialog 
boxes. A <I>dialog box,</I> also known as a 
<I>dialog</I>, is a window that pops up to solicit input 
from the user. The window that appears when you select Open from an 
application's File menu is one example of a dialog box; the window that pops up when you 
select File-Print is another. Dialog boxes are simpler to create than ordinary windows 
because a few statements in an RC file are sufficient to define a dialog box and all the 
controls it contains.
</P>

<P>Dialog boxes come in two basic varieties: modal and 
modeless<I>.</I> A <I>modal</I> dialog box disables the window to which it is assigned&#8212;its 
<I>owner</I>&#8212;until the dialog box is dismissed. It's an application's way of saying, &quot;I can't do anything else until 
you supply me with the input I need.&quot; A 
<I>modeless</I> dialog box behaves more like a conventional window. Its owner can be reactivated even while the dialog box is displayed.
</P>

<P>MFC encapsulates the functionality of both modal and modeless dialog 
boxes in the class named <I>CDialog</I>. Dialog box programming is relatively easy when 
you use the Microsoft Windows SDK, but it's even easier with MFC. You can often 
build even complex dialog boxes with just a few lines of code, which speeds 
program development and reduces the likelihood of errors. MFC also provides convenient 
C++ implementations of the Windows <I>common 
dialogs</I>&#8212;Open dialogs, Print dialogs, and other dialog boxes commonly found in Windows applications.
</P>

<P>A close cousin of the dialog box is the property sheet. A 
<I>property sheet</I> is essentially a dialog box with tabbed pages. Property sheets are great for lending a 
higher level of organization to the controls in a dialog. They're also space-efficient, 
allowing more controls to fit in a finite amount of space, and they're fast becoming 
commonplace in Windows applications. MFC makes property sheet handling simple 
with its <I>CPropertySheet</I> and 
<I>CPropertyPage</I> classes. Take it from someone who's been 
there: if you've programmed property sheets without a class library, you'll appreciate 
the work MFC does to make dealing with property sheets fundamentally no 
different from&#8212;and no more difficult than&#8212;dealing with ordinary dialog boxes.

<P>This section's caption clearly states what I want to 
say. But, of course, we both know that it is a flat-out lie. 
My editors and I have worked hard to bring you the most 
accurate, up-to-date, in-depth, easy-to-read, 
painless-to-understand, bug-free information. Even with the fantastic 
team assembled, we all know that things have slipped through 
the cracks. If you find any mistakes in this book 
(especially bugs), I would greatly appreciate it if you would send 
the mistakes to me via my web site:

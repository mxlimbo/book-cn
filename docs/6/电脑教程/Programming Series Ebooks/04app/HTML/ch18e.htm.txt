<p>In addition to the heap functions I've already mentioned,
Windows offers several more. In this section, I'll just briefly
mention them.</p>

<p>The ToolHelp functions (mentioned at the end of <A HREF="ch04a.htm">Chapter 4</A>) allow you to
enumerate a process's heaps as well as the allocations within those
heaps. For more information, look up the following functions in the
Platform SDK documentation: <i>Heap32First</i>, <i>Heap32Next</i>, 
<i>Heap32ListFirst</i>, and <i>Heap32ListNext.</i> What's great about
the ToolHelp functions is that they are available in both Windows 98
and Windows 2000.</p>

<p>The remaining heap functions discussed in this section exist only in
Windows 2000.</p>

<p>Since a process can have multiple heaps within its address space,
the <i>GetProcessHeaps</i> function allows you to get the handles of
the existing heaps:</p>

<p>The memory architecture used by an operating system is the most
important key to understanding how the operating system does what it
does. When you start working with a new operating system, many
questions come to mind. &quot;How do I share data between two
applications?&quot; &quot;Where does the system store the information
I'm looking for?&quot; and &quot;How can I make my program run more
efficiently?&quot; are just a few.</p>

<p>I have found that more often than not, a good understanding of how
the system manages memory can help determine the answers to these
questions quickly and accurately. This chapter explores the memory
architecture used by Microsoft Windows.</p>

<i>To Kristin, 
With the few words I have left, I want to tell you how much you mean to
me. 
Your energy and exuberance always lift me higher. 
Your smile brightens my every day. 
Your zest makes my heart sing. 
I love you (and Max too). Hap'm.</i>
<p><i>To my mother, Arlene, 
I admire you for your bravery and courage 
through the most difficult and trying of times. 
Your love and support have shaped me into the person I am. 
You're with me wherever I go.</i></p>

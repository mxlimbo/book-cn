<p>With Microsoft Windows becoming more and more popular around the
world, it is increasingly important that we, as developers, target the
various international markets. It was once common for U.S. versions of
software to ship as much as six months prior to the shipping of
international versions. But increasing international support in the
operating system is making it easier to produce applications for
international markets and therefore is reducing the time lag between
distribution of the U.S. and international versions of our
software.</p>

<p>Windows has always offered support to help developers localize their
applications. An application can get country-specific information from
various functions and can examine Control Panel settings to determine
the user's preferences. Windows even supports different fonts for
our applications.</p>

<p>I decided to present this chapter early in the book because
considering Unicode is a fundamental step in the development of any
application. Issues regarding Unicode are discussed in just about every
chapter and all the sample applications presented in this book are
&quot;Unicode-ready.&quot; If you are developing for Microsoft Windows
2000 or Microsoft Windows CE, you should be developing with Unicode,
period. If you are developing for Microsoft Windows 98, you have some
decisions to make. Windows 98 concerns are also discussed in this
chapter.</p>

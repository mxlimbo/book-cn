<A NAME="9"><H1>Why You Should Use Unicode</H1></A>

<p>When developing an application, you should definitely consider
taking advantage of Unicode. Even if you're not planning to
localize your application today, developing with Unicode in mind will
certainly simplify conversion in the future. In addition, Unicode does
the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Enables easy data exchange between languages</li></p>

<p><li>Allows you to distribute a single binary .exe or DLL file that
supports all languages</li></p>

<p><li>Improves the efficiency of your application (discussed in more
detail later in the chapter)</li></p>
</ul>

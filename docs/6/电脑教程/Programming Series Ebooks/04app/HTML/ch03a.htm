<p>We begin our understanding of the Windows API by examining kernel
objects and their handles. This chapter covers relatively abstract
concepts&#8212;we're not going to discuss the particulars of any
specific kernel object. Instead, we're going to discuss features
that apply to all kernel objects.</p>

<p>I would have preferred to start off with a more concrete topic, but
a solid understanding of kernel objects is critical to becoming a
proficient Windows software developer. Kernel objects are used by the
system and by the applications we write to manage numerous resources
such as processes, threads, and files (to name just a few). The
concepts presented in this chapter will appear throughout most of the
remaining chapters in this book. However, I do realize that some of the
material covered in this chapter won't sink in until you start
manipulating kernel objects using actual functions. So, as you read
various other chapters in this book, you'll probably want to refer
back to this chapter from time to time.</p>

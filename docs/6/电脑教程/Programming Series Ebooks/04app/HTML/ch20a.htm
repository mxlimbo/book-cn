<p>In the <a href="ch19a.htm">previous chapter</a>, we discussed the basics of DLL linking and concentrated specifically on implicit linking, which is by far the most common form of DLL linking. The information in that chapter is all you'll ever need for most applications. However, you can do a lot more with DLLs. In this chapter, we'll discuss a hodgepodge of techniques that relate to DLLs. Most applications will not require these techniques, but they can be extremely useful, so you should know about them. I encourage you to at least read the &quot;<A HREF="ch20h.htm#279">Rebasing Modules</A>&quot; and &quot;<A HREF="ch20i.htm#280">Binding Modules</A>&quot; sections in this chapter because the techniques they describe can significantly improve the performance of your entire system.</p>

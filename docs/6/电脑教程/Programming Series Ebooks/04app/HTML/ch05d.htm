<p>Well, certainly one of the most popular things that you will want to
do with a job is kill all of the processes within it. At the beginning
of this chapter, I mentioned that Developer Studio doesn't have an
easy way to stop a build that is in progress because it would have to
know which processes were spawned from the first process that it
spawned. (This is very tricky. I explain how Developer Studio
accomplishes this in my Win32 Q &amp; A column in the June 1998 issue
of Microsoft Systems Journal.) I suspect that future versions of
Developer Studio will use jobs instead because the code is a lot easier
to write and you can do much more with it.</p>

<p>To kill all the processes within a job, you simply call</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr><td>
<PRE>
BOOL TerminateJobObject(
   HANDLE hJob, 
   UINT uExitCode);
</pre></td></tr></table></p>

<p>This is similar to calling <i>TerminateProcess</i> for every process
contained within the job, setting all their exit codes to <i>
uExitCode</i>.</p>

<P>The companion CD-ROM contains the source code and 
executable files for all the sample applications presented in 
the book. All samples were written and compiled with 
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. Most of the applications run on Windows 
95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000, but some 
of the applications require features that exist only in 
Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000. You'll need Microsoft 
Visual C++ 6.0 or later to compile all of the applications.</P>
<P>In the root directory of the CD-ROM, you will find the Visual 
Studio workspace file and the common header file. Under the root directory, there 
is a separate directory for each sample application. The 
<I>x</I>86 and Alpha32 directories contain the debug versions of all the sample applications so that you 
can run them directly from the CD-ROM.</P>
<P>When you insert the CD-ROM into the drive, the Welcome screen 
will present itself automatically. If the screen does not appear, go into the 
drive's Welcome directory and execute the PressCD.exe application.</P>

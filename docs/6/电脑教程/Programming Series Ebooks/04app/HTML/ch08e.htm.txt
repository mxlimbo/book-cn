<p>A <i>critical section</i> is a small section of code that requires
exclusive access to some shared resource before the code can execute.
This is a way to have several lines of code &quot;atomically&quot;
manipulate a resource. By atomic, I mean that the code knows that no
other thread will access the resource. Of course, the system can still
preempt your thread and schedule other threads. However, it will not
schedule any other threads that want to access the same resource until
your thread leaves the critical section.</p>

<p>Here is some problematic code that demonstrates what happens
without the use of a critical section:</p>

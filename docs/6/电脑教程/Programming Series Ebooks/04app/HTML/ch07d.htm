<p>A thread can also tell the system that it does not want to be
schedulable for a certain amount of time. This is accomplished by
calling <i>Sleep</i>:</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr><td>
<PRE>
VOID燬leep(DWORD燿wMilliseconds);
</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>

<p>This function causes the thread to suspend itself until <i>dwMilliseconds</i> have elapsed. There are a few important things to notice about <i>Sleep</i>:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Calling <i>Sleep</i> allows the thread to voluntarily give up the remainder of its time slice.</li></p>

<p><li>The system makes the thread not schedulable for <i>approximately</i> the number of milliseconds specified. That's
right&#8212;if you tell the system you want to sleep for 100 milliseconds, you will sleep approximately that long but possibly
several seconds or minutes more. Remember that Windows is not a
real-time operating system. Your thread will probably wake up at the right time, but whether it does depends on what else is going on in the system.</li></p>

<p><li>You can call <i>Sleep</i> and pass INFINITE for the <i>dwMilliseconds</i> parameter. This tells the system to never schedule the thread. This is not a useful thing to do. It is much better to have the thread exit and to recover its stack and kernel object.</li></p>

<p><li>You can pass 0 to <i>Sleep</i>. This tells the system that the calling thread relinquishes the remainder of its time slice and forces the system to schedule another thread. However, the system can reschedule the thread that just called <i>Sleep</i>. This will happen if there are no more schedulable threads at the same priority.</li></p>
</ul>

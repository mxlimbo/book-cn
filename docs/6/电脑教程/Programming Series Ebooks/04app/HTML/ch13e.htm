<A NAME="173"><H1>Committing Physical Storage Within a Region</H1></A>

<p>To use a reserved region of address space, you must allocate
physical storage and then map this storage to the reserved region. This
process is called <i>committing</i> physical storage. Physical storage
is always committed in pages. To commit physical storage to a reserved
region, you again call the <i>VirtualAlloc</i> function.</p>

<p>When you commit physical storage to regions, you do not have to
commit physical storage to the entire region. For example, you can
reserve a region that is 64 KB and then commit physical storage to the
second and fourth pages within the region. Figure 13-1 shows what a
process's address space might look like. Notice that the address
space is different depending on which CPU platform you're running
on. The address space on the left shows what happens on an <i>x</i>86
machine (which has a 4-KB page), and the address space on the right
shows what happens on an Alpha machine (which has 8-KB pages).</p>

<p>When your program's algorithms no longer need to access
committed physical storage in the reserved region, the physical storage
should be freed. This process is called <i>decommitting</i> the
physical storage and is accomplished by calling the <i>VirtualFree</i>
function.</p>

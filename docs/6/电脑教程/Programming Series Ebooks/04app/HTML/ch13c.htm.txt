<p>Each process's virtual address space is split into partitions.
The address space is partitioned based on the underlying implementation
of the operating system. Partitions vary slightly among the different
Windows kernels. Table 13-1 shows how each platform partitions a
process's address space.</p>

<p>As you can see, the 32-bit Windows 2000 kernel and 64-bit Windows
2000 kernel have nearly identical partitions; what differs are the
partition sizes and locations. On the other hand, you can see that the
partitions under the Windows

<A NAME="125"><H1>Views</H1></A>

<P>As discussed in <A HREF="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</A>, Outlook supports a variety of folder views, 
including custom views, to give you and users flexibility in the presentation and 
organization of information. These views can be used in any type of Outlook 
folder. Outlook allows you to set the initial view for a folder, and it remembers the 
state of the view for each user. Outlook supports five types of views:</p>

<UL>
<P><LI><i>Table view</I>. The most commonly used Outlook view, the table 
view consists of rows and columns that expose the information from 
the folder.</li></p>

<P><LI><i>Timeline view</I>. This view shows, as icons, the chronological order 
of the items in the folder.</li></p>

<P><LI><i>Card view</I>. The card view shows the items in the folder as 
individual cards, similar to a business card file.</li></p>

<P><LI><i>Day/Week/Month view</I>. In this view, items are arranged in a 
calendar. This view is best used for applications that have a date and time 
field as one of the application's primary fields.</li></p>

<P><LI><i>Icon view</I>. The icon view presents all items in the folder as 
individual icons on an invisible grid. The icon view is best used for items 
where seeing the details of the item are not important.</li></p>
</UL>

<A NAME="126"> <H2>Creating New Views</H2></A>

<P>Outlook provides two options for creating new views: defining new views 
with the Define Views dialog box or adding the Current View box to your 
Outlook toolbar. This second option is the easiest and is the one you will 
probably use more often. To add the Current View box to your Outlook toolbar, 
follow these steps:</p>

<OL>
<P><LI>Right-click on the Outlook toolbar, and select Customize.</li></p>

<P><LI>On the Commands tab, select Advanced from the Categories list.</li></p>

<P><LI>On the Commands list, scroll down until you find the Current 
View drop-down list.</li></p>

<P><LI>Drag and drop the Current View drop-down list onto your 
toolbar. You should see Outlook fill in the Current View drop-down list 
with the name of the current view of the folder. You can now use the 
Current View drop-down list to create new views by typing over the 
name in the box.</li></p>
</OL>

<P>When you attempt to save your views, Outlook will prompt you to 
indicate which view will be used. There are three primary ways you can apply 
your views in Outlook:</p>

<UL>
<P><LI><i>This Folder, Visible To Everyone.</I> This option enables the view to be used on the current folder and to be visible to everyone. Any 
person with permissions to open the folder will be able to select this 
view from the drop-down list of current views. As a developer, you 
can create the views for your Outlook application and then save 
them so that all your users can use them.</li></p>

<P><LI><i>This Folder, Visible Only To Me.</I> When you select the private view option, the view is for the current folder but is only visible to the 
current user. You could use this view if you wanted to show 
specialized information (like debugging information) to only certain users, 
not all users of your application.</li></p>

<P><LI><i>All Folders</I>. This option enables the view to be used in all folders 
that have the same item type as the current folder. This allows you to 
share your favorite views across folders of the same type.</li></p>
</UL>

 <P>So far, our Document Library application is only a folder where users 
can drag and drop documents to share with other users. By using views, we can 
transform our simple Document Library application into a more powerful and 
useful application for our users. The first view we are going to create is an icon view 
so that our application looks more like a network file share than an Outlook 
folder. This will make it easier for our users to navigate among the files in the folder. 
To create the icon view for the Document Library application, follow these steps:</p>

<OL>
<P><LI>Select the Document Library folder in Outlook.</li></p>

<P><LI>From the View menu, point to Current View, and then click 
Define Views.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click the New button, and type a name for your view, such as 
<I>As Icon.</I></li></p>

<P><LI>Select Icon from the Type Of View box.</li></p>

<P><LI>Select This Folder, Visible To Everyone in the Can Be Used On area.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click OK. The View Settings dialog box is displayed.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click the Other Settings button, and select the type of icon you 
want to use: Large Icon, Small Icon, or Icon List.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click OK twice.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click Apply View. We now have an icon view of our Document 
Library application. Your view should be similar to the view shown 
in Figure 4-15.</li></p>

<P>

</P><P>
<!-- CAPTION --><B>Figure 4-15</B> <I>An icon view of the information in the Document Library application.</I><!-- /CAPTION -->
</p>

</OL>

<P>The second view we are going to create is a timeline view. This view 
will enable our users to quickly see the last time a document was saved and how 
much time has elapsed between the time the document was created and the time 
it was last edited and saved. By implementing this feature, users can quickly 
discard older versions of the document to ensure they are using the most 
recent version. As you will see in <A HREF="ch05a.htm">Chapter 5</A>, you can customize your views by 
using custom properties directly from Office documents.</p>

<P>To create the timeline view for the Document Library application, 
follow these steps:</p>

<OL>
<P><LI>Follow steps 1 and 2 from the preceding procedure above.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click the New button, and type a name for your view, such as 
<I>Document Timeline</I>.</li></p>

<P><LI>Select Timeline from the Type Of View box.</li></p>

<P><LI>Select This Folder, Visible To Everyone in the Can Be Used On area.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click OK. The View Settings dialog box is displayed.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click the Fields button. The Date/Time Fields dialog box 
is displayed.</li></p>

<P><LI>Select the Created field in the Available Date/Time Fields list as 
the starting time for the document in the view, and then click the 
Start button. </li></p>

<P><LI>Select All Document Fields from the Select Available Fields 
From drop-down list.</li></p>

<P><LI>Select Last Saved Time from the Available Date/Time Fields list, 
and then click the End button so that the last-saved time is the 
ending time for the document in the view.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click OK twice. Click Apply View. The view of your 
documents folder should be similar to Figure 4-16.</li></p>

<P>

</OL>

<A NAME="127"><H2>Customizing the Current View</H2></A>

<P>You can customize the current view by using the Field Chooser to drag and 
drop new columns. After you add the new column, the view is automatically 
updated using values taken from the items in the folder. You can also add complex 
data types to the view, such as combination or formula fields. Many people find 
it easier to customize a view by using the drag-and-drop capabilities of the 
Field Chooser as opposed to selecting available columns from a drop-down list.</p>

<P>To add new columns to the Document Library view, follow these steps:</p>

<OL>
<P><LI>In the Document Library application, create a new table view 
and name it <I>Document Properties</I>.</li></p>

<P><LI>Right-click on any column heading in the Document Properties 
view, and select Field Chooser.</li></p>

<P><LI>Select All Document Fields from the drop-down list.</li></p>

<P><LI>Drag and drop Author, Revision Number, and Last Saved 
Time from the Field Chooser to an area next to one of the columns 
in the view. Outlook presents red arrows to indicate where the 
field will be inserted.</li></p>

<P><LI>To remove a column, select the column heading and then drag 
and drop it off the column heading row.</li></p>
</OL>

<P><DIV CLASS="NOTE"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE</B><HR>
You can remove columns easily from your view by 
dragging the columns until a large X appears. Once you release the 
mouse button, the column disappears from the view.
</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></P>

<A NAME="128"><H2>Formatting the Columns in a View</H2></A>

<P>Notice that when you drag and drop columns from the Field Chooser, 
Outlook, by default, gives the column heading the same name as the field on 
which the column is based. Also notice that Outlook applies default formatting for 
the columns. For example, Outlook automatically formats the Last Saved 
Time column with the day, the date, the year, and the time the document was 
last saved. Most users won't need this much detailed information about the 
last-saved time for the document. To make views more intuitive to your users, 
Outlook allows you to change the name of the column heading without changing 
the name of the underlying field. You can also change the default format of 
values for a specific column in the view. For example, you can change the format 
of the Last Saved Time column heading so that it only displays the date the 
document was last saved rather than the date and the time, as we saw earlier. 
Please note, however, that changing the format of the column does not modify the 
format of the field on which the column is based. To modify the format of the 
field, you must use the Field Chooser. To change the format of a column in 
the Document Library application, follow these steps:</p>

<OL>
<P><LI>Right-click on the Last Saved Time column heading in the 
Document Properties view, and select Format Columns from the 
context menu.</li></p>

<P><LI>In the Format drop-down list, select the option that shows only 
the month, the day, and the year, such as April 07, 1999.</li></p>

<P><LI>In the Label box, enter <I>Last Edit 
Time</I>.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click OK. Your date/time column should look similar to the 
one shown in Figure 4-17.</li></p>

<A NAME="129"><H2>Grouping Items in a View</H2></A>

<P>Grouping items in an Outlook view makes it easy for users to find items 
that are related. Outlook supports up to four levels of grouping in a single view. 
You can group items in a view in one of two ways:</p>

<UL>
<P><LI><i>Using the Group By box</I>. This is the easiest method because it 
allows you to use drag-and-drop functionality to select the column as 
the grouping. If you drag and drop more than one field into the 
Group By box, Outlook graphically draws the relationship between the 
fields as primary groups and subgroups.</li></p>

<P><LI><I>Customizing the Current View option</I>. This method gives you a few more options when setting the grouping for a view, but it isn't as 
easy as using the Group By box.</li></p>
</UL>

<P>To group items by Author using the Group By box, follow these 
steps:</p>

<OL>
<P><LI>Right-click on a column for the Document Library application, 
and select Group By Box to display the Group By box above the 
column headings.</li></p>

<P><LI>Drag and drop the Author column into the Group By box, or 
drag items from the Field Chooser into the Group By box.</li></p>

<P><LI>If you want to group by more than one field, drag and drop a 
second field into the Group By box. For our purposes, drag the 
Categories field from the Field Chooser to the Group By box. 
Notice how Outlook draws a line from the Author field to the 
Categories field to indicate that the view is grouped first by author and then 
by category. Take a look at Figure 4-18.</li></p>

<P><LI>Close the Group By box by right-clicking on a column heading 
and then selecting Group By box.</li></p>
</OL>

<P>To create the same grouping using the Current View option, follow 
these steps:</p>

<OL>
<P><LI>From the View menu, point to Current View, and then click 
Customize Current View.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click the Group By button to display the Group By dialog box.</li></p>

<P><LI>In the Select Available Fields From drop-down list, select All

show the field in the view by checking the Show Field In View check box.</li></p>

<P><LI>In the Select Available Fields From drop-down list, select 
Frequently-Used Fields. In the first Then By area, select the Categories 
field. Figure 4-19 shows the completed Group By 
dialog box.</li></p>

<P>Outlook also supports the ability to sort items in a view in either ascending 
or descending order. When you combine sorting with grouping, you get the 
best combination of features for making your information available to users in a 
view. For example, instead of just grouping our Document Library items by 
author, we can also sort the items so that the most recently saved documents appear 
at the top of the grouping.</p>

<A NAME="131"><H2>Filtering Information in Views</H2></A>

<P>Filtering allows you to create views in which only certain information is 
visible to users. The criteria you set can be built-in Outlook fields or custom 
fields. Filters can have only one or two conditions or they can be more complex, 
using multiple conditions or the advanced filtering features. When you set 
multiple conditions on a filter, Outlook ANDs them together. When you set 
multiple arguments in a single condition, Outlook ORs these arguments so that if 
only some meet the condition, the item appears in the view. To create a simple 
filter for the Document Library application, follow these steps:</p>

<A NAME="132"><H2>Editing View Settings</H2></A>

<P>You can customize the formatting of your views at a more detailed level by 
using the Other Settings dialog box. The type of view you create determines 
which settings are available for you to edit. For example, if you are editing a table 
view, you can set the font size, enable in-cell editing, enable autopreview, create 
gridlines, and enable the preview pane. If you are editing an icon view, you can set 
the view type, such as Large Icons, Small Icons, or Icon List, and you can 
specify whether Outlook should automatically arrange and sort the icons in your view.</p>


<P><div class="sidebar">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>In-Cell Editing</B>
<P>The in-cell editing option for customizing a table view allows users 
to quickly add new items to a folder or change the properties of 
current items in the folder without opening a form. All of the changes to 
the item can be typed directly into the view. This capability helps speed 
up applications that require a lot of data entry, such as customer 
contact lists or surveys.</p>

<P>If you enable in-cell editing in a folder that contains Office 
documents, you cannot modify the properties of the Office documents 
directly in the view. These properties are read-only inside of Outlook. 
You must modify these properties using the Office program that 
originally created the document.</p>

</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></P>

<A NAME="133"><H3>Conditional Formatting</H3></A>

<P>If your custom view is a table view, you can use the conditional 
formatting capabilities of Outlook. Conditional formatting enables items that meet 
certain conditions to use your custom formatting. For example, you can set a 
condition in the Document Library application so that all Word documents 
appear in a 12-point, red Arial font. Outlook automatically sets some default 
formats for the most common conditions, such as unread, expired, and overdue 
e-mail. You can customize the settings for these default conditions or create your 
own conditions. To set conditional formatting, follow these steps:</p>

<OL>
<P><LI>From the View menu, point to Current View, and then click 
Customize Current View.</li></p>

<A NAME="134"><H3>Limiting Views to Only Those Created for the Folder</H3></A>

<P>Outlook, by default, provides several standard views in a folder based on 
the folder's default content type. In many cases, these default views are not 
relevant to your application, so you will not want them to appear in the Outlook 
view list. Outlook allows you to hide the default views and only show custom

<P>If you are planning to use Outlook Web Access as one of the 
clients for your application, the Only Show Views Created For This

<A NAME="135"><H3>Implementing Threaded Views</H3></A>

<P>Many times, you'll want to display the information in a folder as a threaded 
view so that users can see the history of responses to an item. These responses 
are indented in the view to make it easier to follow the flow of information 
about the item. In a folder based on e-mail items, Outlook provides a default view 
called By Conversation Topic, which provides this threading capability. But 
suppose you don't build your application based on e-mail items but instead build it 
based on tasks. To create threaded views in these types of folders, Outlook 
supports two unique properties called Conversation and Conversation Index.</p>

<P>The conversation field is based on the message's subject field. This 
means that when you create a new item in a folder, the conversation field is 
automatically filled with the content of the item's subject field, so any replies inherit 
the conversation field from the original item.</p>

<P>The conversation index is a unique identifier used by Outlook to track 
the series of responses to an item. This index allows Outlook to know which 
item in the thread the user is responding to and where the response should be 
placed in the threaded view.</p>

<P>To implement threaded views for any of your Outlook folders, you 
must group by the conversation field and sort in ascending order by the 
conversation index. The sort by conversation index is usually the step that most 
developers forget about when trying to implement threading. Without it, your view 
will be grouped only by the conversation index and will be void of any indented 
text indicating responses to items.</p>

<P>To implement threaded views in Outlook folders, follow this procedure:</p>

<OL>
<P><LI>From the View menu, point to Current View, and then click 
Customize Current View.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click the Group By button.</li></p>

<P><LI>In the Group Items By area, select Conversation and click OK.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click the Sort button.</li></p>

<P><LI>In the Sort Items By area, select Conversation Index. To see 
this property, you might have to select All Mail Fields from the 
Select Available Fields From drop-down list.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click OK twice.</li></p>
</OL>

In all folders except those based on e-mail items, 
Outlook does not automatically make the Post Reply To This Folder 
menu option available. This menu option allows you to post replies in 
a folder that automatically inherit the conversation property from 
the original item. To enable this menu option, you can add this 
command to the Outlook menu or toolbar.

<A NAME="3"><H1>A Broader Definition of Collaboration</H1></A>

<P>If you asked ten different people to define collaboration in a computer 
environment, you would receive ten different answers. Some would say 
collaboration is e-mail. Others would mention video teleconferencing or the World 
Wide Web. You might even hear Internet chat as an answer. People struggle to 
define collaboration because there are so many technologies and its definition 
today is broad. Really, all of these answers are correct. Collaboration&#8212;at least in 
part&#8212;is the integration of many different technologies into a single application 
or environment to facilitate information sharing and information management.</P>
<P>Integrated technology, however, is only one aspect of collaboration as 
we're defining it. Timing is another. We're all familiar with real-time collaboration 
in which you work with others at the same moment, taking turns 
communicating ideas. But new technology offers you an entirely different way to 
collaborate&#8212;asynchronous collaboration&#8212;in which you don't have to be present to 
participate. Asynchronous collaboration allows you, at your convenience, to 
collaborate with other people, at their convenience. E-mail, public databases, the 
Internet, and intranets are all forms of asynchronous communication.</P>
<P>Collaborative technology provides these key benefits to businesses:</P>
<UL>
<P><LI><I>Extensive, secure communication.</I> Collaborative technologies 
enable extensive communication through many different mediums and 
secure communication through encryption and digital signature 
technology, which is critical as businesses increase their use of the Internet.</LI></P>
<P><LI><I>Storage of information in a central location.</I> Information is placed in a central repository, or database, so that individuals inside and 
outside a corporation can access it. If shown in a threaded view, 
the history of the information is accessible and new information can 
be added to it.</LI></P>
<P><LI><I>Ability to extend existing technologies with new functionality and 
bridge islands of information.</I> Collaborative systems connect disparate 
systems and facilitate finding and sharing information stored in 
existing technologies. Essentially, they bridge islands of information.</LI></P>
</UL>
 <P>How does a collaborative system provide these benefits to 
corporations? In terms of its architecture, a collaborative system must have several 
characteristics. First, it must have a robust, replicated object database that can store 
many different types of information such as web pages, office documents, and 
e-mail messages, and it must support replication both from server to server and 
from server to client. This replication allows geographically dispersed individuals 
to access diverse information. To work with the data, the database needs to 
allow many different clients, ranging from web browsers to e-mail clients.</P>
<P>Second, it must support the Internet and industry standards. The days 
of stovepipe computing are over. New technologies are connecting disparate 
networks to form one global, cohesive network. A collaborative system must be 
able to interoperate with these networks over the Internet, and it must follow 
industry standards to allow openness to a large number of external systems as well 
as guarantee the integrity of the data.</P>
<P>Third, a collaborative system must offer powerful, easy-to-use 
development tools and technologies. The environment must be open so that developers 
can use any tool to develop solutions and users can access and customize the 
user interface.</P>

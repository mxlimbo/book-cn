<A NAME="103"><H1>Choosing a Client</H1></A>

<P>As a developer preparing to build a messaging, tracking, workflow, real-time, or knowledge management application for Exchange Server, your first question is: &quot;Which client interface should I use&#8212;Microsoft Outlook or a web browser?&quot; The answer depends on a number of factors.</p>

<P>You need to ask yourself a few questions. For example, does the 
application need offline support? If the answer is yes, consider using Outlook, 
which has built-in support for offline forms, and which automatically 
synchronizes any offline changes to Exchange Server. Compare this functionality to the 
web browser client, which has limited support for offline forms. Web browsers 
can cache web pages for offline viewing, but they cannot process server-side 
scripts such as Active Server Pages without a web server on the local machine. 
The typical user does not have a web server on a local machine.</p>

<P>Non-Win32 client support, such as Windows 3.1, Microsoft 
Windows for Workgroups, Macintosh, and UNIX, is another factor to look at when 
designing applications. The ubiquity of web browsers for multiple operating 
systems has enabled web-based applications to provide cross-platform client support. 
Although Microsoft Outlook runs only on Windows 95, Windows 98, and 
Windows NT, new technology enables Outlook forms to be converted to 
web-based applications. This technology, called the Outlook HTML Forms Converter, 
is discussed in detail in <A HREF="ch08a.htm">Chapter 8</A>.</p>

<P>Your skill as a developer is another factor to consider. Microsoft 
Outlook offers a very approachable development environment, even for the novice 
developer. It also provides built-in capabilities that allow power users or developers 
to customize an application without writing any code&#8212;very appealing to those 
who want to meet a specific need quickly and avoid creating an application from scratch.</p>

<P>If you are more familiar with other development tools, consider that 
Exchange Server exposes its services through a rich API that can be called 
from any development environment that supports COM. Some examples of 
these development environments include Microsoft Visual Basic, Microsoft 
Office (through Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications), Microsoft Visual 
C++, and Microsoft Visual J++. This environment flexibility allows you to leverage the 
tools and skills you currently have.</p>

<A NAME="83"><H1>Integrated, Internet Standards-Based Security</H1></A>

<P>With so many corporations connecting their systems to the Internet and 
exposing their networks to millions of Internet users, security has become a large 
concern. While most users on the Internet are not lurking and waiting to break 
into corporate networks, some &quot;bad apples&quot; on the Internet are. Exchange 
Server prevents these users from accessing privileged information by 
implementing Internet standards-based security in an integrated way.</p>

<A NAME="84"><H2>Windows NT Security</H2></A>

<P>Exchange Server integrates with Windows NT security in two ways. First, 
users have to be authenticated using a Windows NT account before gaining 
access to any Exchange Server resource that requires authenticated access. 
Administrators can set up a Windows NT security infrastructure, and Exchange 
Server will use that infrastructure for its own security and access permissions. 
This enables users to log on only once to access both the network and 
Exchange Server services.</p>

<P>Second, Exchange Server uses the built-in auditing capabilities of 
Microsoft Windows NT. This integration allows an administrator to detect security 
breaches by tracking events, across Windows NT and Exchange Server, which occur within a system. All the events can be viewed in one window using the Windows NT event log.</p>

<A NAME="85"><H2>Secure Messaging</H2></A>

<P>Many corporations today use the Internet as a backbone for their 
corporate communications system. While this is cheaper than leasing lines between 
servers, it opens a world of security concerns. Exchange Server alleviates these 
concerns by implementing some key features that allow corporations to securely use 
the Internet as a communications network backbone. For securely sending 
messages between servers, Exchange Server supports Secure Socket Layers (SSL) in 
combination with the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). SMTP is the 
primary way that different mail systems talk over the Internet. SSL allows systems 
to encrypt data sent from one system to the other. By implementing SSL 
with SMTP, an organization can encrypt its data from one Exchange Server to 
another when sending the data over the Internet.</p>

<A NAME="86"><H2>Secure Applications</H2></A>

<P>SSL is not only supported with use of SMTP, but it is also used with 
other Internet protocols that Exchange Server supports. By using SSL, Outlook 
Web Access can encrypt any traffic between a user's web browser and web server. 
This secures any HTML documents that Outlook Web Access is sending to the 
user. You can take advantage of SSL when using custom forms in the web forms 
library of Outlook Web Access.</p>

<A NAME="87"><H2>S/MIME Support</H2></A>

<P>Exchange Server supports encryption and digital signatures by using 
Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, or S/MIME for short. An 
Internet standard, S/MIME is a method of digitally signing and encrypting 
messages between users on the same vendor's system or users on different vendors' systems.</p>

<P>S/MIME is built on X.509 version 3 certificates. These certificates 
are generated by a certificate authority such as VeriSign or Certificate Server 
included with the Microsoft Windows NT version 4 Option Pack. Since Exchange 
Server supports X.509 version 3 certificates, it can accept the certificates from 
other certificate authorities. Similarly, clients can trust certificates from other 
authorities through the use of Certificate Trust Lists.</p>

<P>Exchange Server also supports the revocation of security certificates. 
Revoking certificates is useful when a user feels that her security has been 
compromised and someone else is signing messages on her behalf. Likewise, when a user 
leaves an organization, you might want to revoke the user's certificate to make 
sure that all messages sent by this user are marked invalid. When an 
administrator revokes the certificates for a user, any encrypted messages previously sent by 
that user will notify other users, upon opening of the messages, that the 
certificate is invalid. After revoking a certificate, the administrator can issue a new 
certificate to the user.</p>

<P>As a developer, you can take advantage of the advanced security 
features of Exchange Server. By building your applications based on the standard 
Outlook e-mail message, you automatically inherit the advanced security 
functionality in Outlook. This allows you to digitally sign and encrypt your custom 
forms before the user sends or posts forms.</p>

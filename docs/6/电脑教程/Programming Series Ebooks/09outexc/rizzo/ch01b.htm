<A NAME="4"><H1>Tools for Building Collaborative Systems</H1></A>

<P>Microsoft offers a number of products and tools that are designed to help 
you leverage a company's current technology investments and extend them with 
new functionality. These tools, which fall under three key product types, are listed here:</P>
<UL>
<P><LI><I>Client products.</I> Tools include Microsoft Outlook and 
Microsoft Internet Explorer.</LI></P>
<P><LI><I>Server products.</I> Tools include Microsoft Exchange Server, 
Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Internet Information Services and 
Microsoft Site Server.</LI></P>
<P><LI><I>Development products.</I> Tools include Microsoft Visual Studio, 
which encompasses Microsoft Visual Basic and Microsoft Visual InterDev.</LI></P>
</UL>

 <P>The two main tools you will want to learn are Microsoft Outlook 
and Microsoft Exchange Server. Both provide a robust infrastructure with 
which corporations can run mission critical services. Combine this infrastructure 
with the rich development tools provided by both products and you have a 
powerful platform on which you can write solutions. The type and complexity of 
these solutions can range from simple forms to complex applications. The next 
few sections briefly describe some products and tools available from Microsoft 
for building collaborative solutions.</P>

<A NAME="5"><H2>Microsoft Outlook</H2></A>

<P>Outlook supports the ability to manage information (e-mail messages, 
appointments, contacts, and tasks) and share it throughout an organization. 
Outlook also includes a development environment that allows you to write 
collaborative applications quickly. Part II of this book is dedicated to Outlook and its 
development environment. <a href="ch09a.htm#296">Chapters 9</a> and <a href="ch10a.htm#338">10</a> in particular discuss and illustrate 
the features of Outlook 2000 that will enable you to further extend Outlook.</P>

<A NAME="6"><H2>Microsoft Internet Explorer</H2></A>

<P>With the ubiquity of the Internet, browser technology is becoming 
increasingly important for user collaboration. Internet Explorer, with its support for 
dynamic HTML, scripting, and security, is an ideal client interface for your 
applications. In <a href="ch11a.htm#353">Chapters 11</a>, <a href="ch12a.htm#406">12</a>, and <a href="ch13a.htm#442">13</a>, you will see how to take advantage of Internet 
Explorer using both Outlook and Exchange Server.</P>

<A NAME="7"><H2>Microsoft Exchange Server</H2></A>

<P>Exchange Server, which is part of the Microsoft BackOffice suite of 
products, is a linchpin for any collaborative system because it supports 
communication, information sharing, and workflow services that use Internet standards and 
protocols. <A HREF="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</A> of this book provides an introduction to Exchange Server.</P>

<A NAME="8"><H2>Microsoft SQL Server</H2></A>

<P>SQL Server is a relational database system that offers easy storage and 
retrieval of relational information. Its built-in data replication, powerful 
management tools, Internet integration, and open system architecture allow you to 
integrate SQL Server into existing environments cost-effectively.</P>

<A NAME="9"><H2>Microsoft Internet Information Server</H2></A>

<P>Internet Information Server is a free web server available for Microsoft 
Windows NT Server. It provides an easy way to publish and share 
information securely over corporate intranets and the Internet through HTML 
documents. The power of IIS is demonstrated when web applications are written using 
its built-in server-side script technology called Microsoft Active Server Pages 
(ASP). ASP allows developers to write applications by using any ActiveX scripting 
language, such as JScript and Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting 
Edition (VBScript). These scripts execute on IIS and can access 
different data such as that provided by Exchange Server or SQL Server. The information returned from the 
server-side script is in HTML, making these applications compatible with any 
standard HTML web browser such as Internet Explorer. <A HREF="ch08a.htm">Chapter 8</A> introduces 
Active Server Pages and its programming model.</P>

<A NAME="10"><H2>Microsoft Site Server</H2></A>

<P>Site Server is a web publishing, analysis, and search tool. Because Site Server 
is integrated with Windows NT Server and IIS, you can easily set up and 
deploy intranets. Site Server helps corporations get the most from their intranets 
by implementing best practices for publishing and staging intranet content.</P>
<P>Site Server can also implement content tagging. Content tagging is a 
structured, site vocabulary that authors use to classify the web content they 
create. When used in conjunction with Site Server's integrated search and 
knowledge management capabilities, these tags enable users to more easily find 
information. Plus, Site Server integrates and manages the information from other 
BackOffice products through full-text indexing of these different data sources.</P>

<A NAME="11"><H2>Microsoft Visual Studio</H2></A>

<P>Visual Studio is an integrated and comprehensive suite of development tools 
for building web-based or Microsoft Windows_based applications. You can 
quickly build collaborative solutions that take advantage of the BackOffice family of 
products because Visual Studio and BackOffice are integrated. Throughout this 
book, you will see examples of collaborative solutions that use Visual Studio tools.</P>

<A NAME="12"><H2>Microsoft Visual Basic</H2></A>

<P>Visual Basic is an effective and easy-to-use tool for creating 
high-performance windows applications. It includes a rapid development environment with 
graphical layout tools and great performance because of native code compilation. 
Visual Basic also creates open, industry-standard ActiveX components. These 
components can provide functionality to other applications whether they are 
web-based or Windows-based.</P>

<A NAME="13"><H2>Microsoft Visual InterDev</H2></A>

<P>Visual InterDev empowers web application developers to rapidly build 
fully interactive, dynamic web sites. With visual development features and 
powerful database tools, Visual InterDev provides the most complete and 
technically advanced development system for building both intranet and Internet 
applications. Through the use of Visual InterDev Design-time controls and 
wizards, you can add collaborative technologies to your web applications.</P>

<P>Information in a corporation is stored in various places. For employees, 
business partners, and customers to collaborate effectively, these &quot;islands&quot; of 
information must become connected, and information must be accessible. To 
enable this, Microsoft Exchange Server has a number of built-in migration and 
coexistence tools.</p>

<P>A series of connectors enable an Exchange Server to coexist with other 
types of collaborative systems. These connectors ensure the reliable delivery of 
messages between Exchange Server and these other systems, but the connector's 
capabilities do not stop there. The connector can also provide directory 
synchronization between the two systems. Directory synchronization gives clients on both 
systems the ability to seamlessly query the directory for users on another system. 
This global, unified directory in the Exchange Server system makes building 
collaborative applications easier because it centralizes information. The systems 
that Microsoft Exchange Server can connect to, send messages from, and 
synchronize directories with include Microsoft Mail, Lotus cc:Mail, and Lotus Notes. 
Exchange Server can transfer messages with host-based systems, such as OfficeVision 
VM (PROFS), and System Network Architecture Distribution Services 
(SNADS) systems, such as IBM OfficeVision/MVS and Fisher TAO.</p>

<P>Sometimes, corporations find it more cost-effective to have only one 
collaborative system rather than several. To help organizations move to 
Exchange Server, migration tools for a large number of systems are included in the 
product. These tools make it easier for organizations to transfer their users and 
information into the Exchange Server system. The products supported by 
these migration tools are Microsoft Mail, Lotus cc:Mail, Novell Groupwise, 
Collabra Share, and Lotus Notes.</p>

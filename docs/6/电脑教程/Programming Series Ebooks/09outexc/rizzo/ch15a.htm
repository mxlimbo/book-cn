<A NAME="512"><H1>Enhancing Your Exchange Server Applications with COM Components</H1></A>

<P>Throughout this book, we've looked at ways to develop applications that 
take advantage of the collaborative functionality of both Microsoft Exchange 
Server and Microsoft Outlook. And by now you're probably wondering how to 
work around the functionality <I>not</I> provided by the Microsoft Collaboration 
Data Objects (CDO) and Outlook object models discussed in this book. For 
example, how do you programmatically change permissions on folders from a web 
page when users don't have Outlook on their machines? And how do you 
programmatically create, delete, and edit rules on the server so that your 
applications don't require the user to set rules through Outlook? Perhaps you can save 
time by using rules rather than the event scripting agent for simple tasks like 
automatically forwarding new messages or returning unwanted messages to 
the sender. Or maybe you need the ability to create, delete, and modify 
Microsoft Windows NT accounts and programmatically set the security descriptors for 
newly created Active Directory Services Interface (ADSI) Exchange Server 
accounts. CDO and the Outlook object model do not automatically provide these 
capabilities, but Microsoft has released three COM components that do: 
AcctCrt, ACL, and Rules. Because Exchange Server is extensible, you can use these 
components in your applications. You can pretty much guess the functionality of these 
components by their names:</p>

<UL>
<P><LI>AcctCrt is an account creation component that was used in 
the ADSI application in <A HREF="ch14a.htm">Chapter 14</A>. It allows you to create and 
associate Windows NT accounts with Exchange Server mailboxes so that 
you can use ADSI to create functional mailboxes in Exchange Server.</li></p>

<P><LI>ACL is a component that allows you to programmatically 
query, create, or change permissions on folders for users or distribution lists.</li></p>

<P><LI>Rules allows you to programmatically create, change, or delete 
rules on your folders.</li></p>
</UL>

 <P>These components ship as part of the Microsoft Platform SDK, but to 
make obtaining and using these components easier, I've included them on the 
companion CD in a folder named COM Components. I have also included 
sample applications from the Platform SDK that use the components. This 
chapter describes all three components and then shows a sample application 
named Project that uses two of them&#8212;Rules and ACL. Because AcctCrt 
was used in <A HREF="ch14a.htm">Chapter 14</A>, we'll just look at some simple 
samples.</p>

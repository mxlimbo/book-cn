<A NAME="408"><H1>Event Service Cautions</H1></A>

<P>The Exchange Event Service fires events asynchronously rather 
than synchronously in the context of the Exchange Information 
Store, so the Information Store won't block your event script or 
other processes or people from working on the items in the folder if 
your script hasn't run yet. A user or another process, then, could 
delete, move, or change an item before an event based on the item is 
fired and your script is executed. Your scripts will receive the 
proper events in this situation, but the items might not be 
available. For this reason, don't use the Event Service to monitor 
folders, such as your Inbox and Outbox, that have very high volumes of 
items entering, leaving, or being deleted. In these types of 
folders, the chances are greater that the user or the rules engine on 
the server will move or delete the item before your script is run.</P>
<P>You shouldn't use the Event Service to provide a mechanism for 
&quot;house rules&quot; either. House rules are general rules containing business logic that 
you want installed on every folder in the system. Using the Event Service for a 
system that uses house rules will bog down the Exchange Servers running the 
Event Service because of the high volume of messages generating events. As well, 
you would have to manually install the agent in every folder because the Event 
Service does not provide this capability. The Agent Install application discussed later 
in this chapter will help you get around the problem of manually installing 
scripts into folders. The Agent Install program will show you how to 
programmatically create and bind agents using the components that ship with the 
Exchange Event Service.</P>

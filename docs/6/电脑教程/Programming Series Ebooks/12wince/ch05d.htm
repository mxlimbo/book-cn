<A NAME="204"><H1>Other Common Controls</H1></A>

<P>Windows CE supports a number of other common controls available under Windows 98 and Windows NT. Most of these controls are supported completely within the limits of the capability of Windows CE. For example, while the tab control supports vertical tabs, Windows CE supports vertical text only on systems that support TrueType fonts. For other systems, including the Palm-size PC, the text in the tabs must be manually generated by the Windows CE application by rotating bitmap images of each letter. Frankly, it's probably much easier to devise a dialog box that doesn't need vertical tabs. Short descriptions of the other supported common controls follow.

<A NAME="205"><H3>The status bar control</H3></A>

<P>The status bar is carried over unchanged from the desktop versions of Windows. The only difference is that under Windows CE, the SBARS_SIZEGRIP style that created a gripper area on the right end of the status bar has no meaning because users can't size Windows CE windows.

<A NAME="206"><H3>The tab control</H3></A>

<P>The tab control is fully supported, the above-mentioned vertical text limitation not withstanding. But because the stylus can't hover over a tab, the TCS_HOTTRACK style that highlighted tabs under the cursor isn't supported. The TCS_EX_REGISTERDROP extended style is also not supported.

<A NAME="207"><H3>The trackbar control</H3></A>

<P>The trackbar control gains the capacity for two &quot;buddy&quot; controls that are automatically updated with the trackbar value. The trackbar also supports the custom draw service, providing separate item drawing indications for the channel, the thumb, and the tic marks.

<A NAME="208"><H3>The progress bar control </H3></A>

<P>The progress bar includes the latest support for vertical progress bars and 32-bit ranges. This control also supports the new smooth progression instead of moving the progress indicator in discrete chunks.

<A NAME="209"><H3>The up-down control</H3></A>

<P>The up-down control under Windows CE only supports edit controls for its buddy control.

<A NAME="210"><H3>The toolbar control</H3></A>

<P>The Windows CE toolbar supports tooltips differently from the way tool tips are supported by the desktop versions of this control. You add toolbar support for tool tips in Windows CE the same way you do for the command bar, by passing a pointer to a permanently allocated array of strings. The toolbar also supports the transparent and flat styles that are supported by the command bar.

<A NAME="211"><H3>The tree view control</H3></A>

<P>The tree view control supports two new styles recently added to the tree view common control: TVS_CHECKBOXES and TVS_SINGLESEL. The TVS_CHECKBOXES style places a check box adjacent to each item in the control. The TVS_SINGLESEL style causes a previously expanded item to close up when a new item is selected. The tree view control also supports the custom draw service. The tree view control doesn't support the TVS_TRACKSELECT style, which allows you to highlight an item when the cursor hovers over it.

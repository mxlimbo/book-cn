<P>If there's one area of the Win32 API that Windows CE doesn't skimp, it's in communication. It makes sense. Systems running Windows CE are either mobile, requiring extensive communication functionality, or they're devices generally employed to communicate with remote servers. In this chapter, I introduce the low-level serial and infrared communication APIs. You use the infrared port at this level in almost the same manner as a serial port. The only functional difference is that infrared transmission is <I>half duplex</I>, that is, transmission can occur in only one direction at a time.

<P>Traditionally, Microsoft Windows platforms have allowed users two methods of input: the keyboard and the mouse. Windows CE continues this tradition, but replaces the mouse with a stylus and touch screen. Programmatically, the change is minor because the messages from the stylus are mapped to the mouse messages used in other versions of Windows. A more subtle but also more important change from versions of Windows that run on PCs is that a system running Windows CE might have either a tiny keyboard or no keyboard at all. This makes the stylus input that much more important for Windows CE systems.

<P>Because Windows CE applications are almost always running in a limited memory environment, it seems likely that they'll need an Out Of Memory dialog box. The standard Windows CE shells give you just such a dialog box as a system service. Figure 12-3 shows this dialog box on a Casio E-10 Palm-size PC.

<P>The advantage of using the system-provided Out Of Memory dialog box is that you don't have to create one yourself in what, by definition, is already a low-memory condition. The dialog box provided by the system is also correctly configured for the proper screen size and local language. To display an Out Of Memory dialog box, you call this function:

<p><pre>
int SHShowOutOfMemory (HWND hwndOwner, UINT grfFlags);
</PRE>

<P><!-- caption --><B>Figure 12-3.</B> <I>The Windows CE Out Of Memory dialog box.</I><!-- /caption -->

<P>The two parameters are the owner window and <I>grfFlags</I>, which must be set to 0. In the latest versions of Windows CE, this function has been moved from the shell so that it's available to embedded systems designed with the Embedded Toolkit (ETK).

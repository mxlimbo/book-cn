<A NAME="4"><H1>Using COM Interfaces</H1></A>

<P>In many cases, applications use COM interfaces without even knowing that's what they're doing. In the RAPI stream example I used in <A HREF="ch11a.htm">Chapter 11</a>, both the CE-side and the PC-side applications used an <I>IStream</I> interface. This interface is formally defined as a COM interface, but because the pointer to the interface was provided, neither the CE- nor the PC-side applications had to know anything about COM.

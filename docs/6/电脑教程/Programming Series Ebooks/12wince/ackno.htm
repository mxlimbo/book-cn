<font size="+3">Acknowledgments</font>
<P>I'd heard stories from authors about the travails of writing a book. Still I was 
unprepared for the task. While I wrote, I learned just how much of a team effort is 
necessary to make a book. My name appears on the cover, but countless others 
were involved in its creation.
<P>First, there is the talented team at Microsoft Press. Kathleen Atkins, the 
project leader and editor of this book, took my gnarled syntax and confused text and 
made it readable. Kathleen, thanks for your words of encouragement, your guidance, 
and for making this book as good as it is. The book's technical editor, Jim Fuchs, was 
my voice in the initial editing process. His judgement was so good that I rarely had 
to correct an edit for technical reasons. Many thanks also go to Cheryl Penner, the 
copy editor and proofreader; Elizabeth Hansford the principal compositor; and 
Michael Victor, who translated my stick drawings into professional illustrations. Finally, 
thanks to Eric Stroo, who took a chance and signed me to write this book. Eric, the sun 
seems to be out now.
<P>For technical help, I was privileged to be able to mine the golden 
knowledge of the Microsoft Windows CE development team. Special thanks go to Mike 
Thomson who put up with endless inquiries about the technical details of Windows CE. 
On the rare occasions that Mike didn't have the answer, he guided me to the folks 
who did. Among those folks who helped were Dave Campbell, Carlos Alayo, Scott 
Holden, Omar Maabreh, Jeff Kelley, and Jeff Blum. While these guys did the best they 
could, I am, of course, responsible for any mistakes introduced into the text as I 
interpreted their answers.
<P>You can't write a book of this type without hardware. My thanks go to 
Cheryl Balbach, Scott Nelson, and the Casio Corporation for their assistance. When 
other companies turned me down, Casio stepped up to the plate and provided 
prerelease and hard-to-find hardware necessary to test my code. Thanks, Cheryl. Call me of 
you need any more drop-testing performed.
<P>I also owe a debt of gratitude to the folks at Vadem Ltd. It was through 
working at Vadem that I was initially introduced to Windows CE, and amazingly enough, 
allowed to contribute to the creation of one of the machines you'll see in the 
introduction. Thanks to Craig Colvin, who talked me into working a Vadem and is now 
busy designing new and innovative Windows CE products; John Zhao, the president; 
and Henry Fung, CTO, as well as the managers down the line, Jim Stair and Norm 
Farquhar. Thanks for allowing me to disappear as the book ran behind schedule. I'd also 
like to thank Edmond Ku, Scott Chastain, Ron Butterworth, Anthony Armenta, and 
the rest of the Clio team.
<P>One good friend deserves special mention. Jeff Prosise started me down 
this path when he talked me into writing my first article in 1985. When you get past 
his honesty, good nature, and modesty, you're left with one incredibly smart guy, 
devoted to his family and friends. Thanks, Jeff, for everything.
<P>My career as a writer started at the top, <I>PC 
Magazine</I>. There, I'd like to thank Michael Miller, Jake Kirchner, Bill Howard, and Gail Shaffer. Other folks no 
longer directly tied to the magazine but whom I still regard as part of the 
<I>PC Magazine</I> family are Bill Machrone, Trudy Neuhaus, and Dale Lewallen.
<P>In addition, I thank two of the masters&#8212;Charles Petzold and Ray Duncan. 
These guys, along with Jeff Prosise, write the best technical books on the planet.
<P> Thanks also to the folks at <I>Microsoft Systems 
Journal</I> and <I>Microsoft Interactive</I> 
<I>Developer</I>, Eric Maffei, Josh Trupin, and Gretchen Bilson. A special thanks goes 
to Joe Flanigan, who introduced me to some of the folks on the Windows CE team 
at Microsoft.
<P>I'd also like to thank a number of musical groups that helped me through 
long hours in front of the PC. These include but aren't limited to the Beach Boys, the 
Cranberries, Alan Parson's Project, Toad the Wet Sprocket, the Eagles, and Dire 
Straits. Thanks also to the Southland Corporation, owners of the 7-Eleven franchise for 
inventing the Big Gulp, and its more potent cousins, the Super Big Gulp and the 
Double Gulp. Thanks also to the Coca-Cola Corporation for providing the caffeine.
<P>On a more serious note, if there's any one person whose name also deserves 
to be on the cover of this book, it's Nancy Jane Hendricks Boling, my wife. Nancy 
endured a year of being a single parent because I spent every spare moment in front 
of my PC and an array of Windows CE devices writing this book. Thank you Nancy. 
I'm sure I didn't say it enough over the past year. I love you. Your name isn't on the 
cover, but the book is dedicated to you. I must also mention two other family 
members&#8212;our sons Andy, our 2 &#189; year old, and Sam, born during the writing of Chapter 9. 
Andy is well on his way to becoming the best big brother a boy can be. Sam, well, he 
has the cutest giggle. Thanks also to Amy Sekeras for taking such good care of Andy 
and Sam.
<P>Finally, I lack the words to adequately say thanks to my parents, Ronald 
and Jane Boling. Mom and Dad, you are simply the best parents I know, met, or ever 
read about. It is my goal in life to attempt to be as good a parent to my children as you 
are to, Rob, Chris, Jay, and me. I am truly blessed to have you as parents.

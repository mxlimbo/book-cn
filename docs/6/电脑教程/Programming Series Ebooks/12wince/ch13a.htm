<A NAME="471"><H1>Shell Programming -- Part 2</H1></A>

<P>A Windows CE programmer needs to understand at least three shells when programming a Windows CE device. The Handheld PC and Handheld PC Pro devices, each equipped with a keyboard and a landscape-oriented screen, use an Explorer-type shell that looks similar to the shell used by Windows 95 and Windows NT 4. The Palm-size PC and other Windows CE keyboardless devices, which come equipped with a portrait-oriented screen, use a completely different shell, one that doesn't expose the file system to the user. Each of these devices has an Active Desktop that displays information from various applications directly on the desktop. The third shell a Windows CE programmer needs to know is the one not written. This is the custom shell, written by the OEM designing an embedded device.

<P>This chapter covers components that most directly relate to the Palm-size PC shell, although the technologies presented in this chapter aren't restricted to use in the Palm-size PC. The primary difference between the Palm-size PC and other Windows CE devices is the Palm-size PC's lack of a full hardware keyboard. In its place, is the Supplementary Input Panel, or SIP, which gives the user a way to register keystrokes directly on the screen. However, as with many Windows CE technologies, the SIP has now been generalized in Windows CE 2.1 for use on other platforms.

<P>I'll also cover how to handle the hardware buttons that are on many Palm-size PCs. These buttons can be used two ways&#8212;to launch an application or to provide additional keys to an application while it's running. While the navigation buttons are specific to the Palm-size PC, the application launch buttons are also available on some Handheld PC and Handheld PC Pro systems as well as other Windows CE-based systems.

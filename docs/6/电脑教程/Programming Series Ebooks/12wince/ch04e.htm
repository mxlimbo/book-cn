<A NAME="160"><H1>Conclusion of Chapter 4</H1></A>
<P>This chapter has covered a huge amount of ground, from basic child windows to controls and on to dialog boxes and property sheets. My goal wasn't to teach everything there is to know about these topics. Instead, I've tried to introduce these program elements, provide a few examples, and point out the subtle differences between the way they're handled by Windows CE and the desktop versions of Windows.

<P>This chapter also marks the end of the introductory section, &quot;Windows Programming Basics.&quot; In these first four chapters, I've talked about fundamental Windows programming while also using a basic Windows CE application to introduce the concepts of the system message queue, windows, and messages. I've given you an overview of how to paint text and graphics in a window and how to query the user for input. Finally, I talked about the windows hierarchy, controls, and dialog boxes. For the remainder of the book, I move from description of the elements common to both Windows CE and the desktop versions of Windows to the unique nature of Windows CE programming. I begin this process in <A HREF="ch05a.htm">Chapter 5</a> by talking about another set of controls, the <I>common controls,</I> this time with an emphasis on controls unique to Windows CE.

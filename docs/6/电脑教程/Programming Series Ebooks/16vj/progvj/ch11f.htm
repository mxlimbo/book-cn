<A NAME="392"><H1>Conclusion</H1></A>

<p>WFC together with the basic Java library provides a powerful set of functions. In 
those rare cases when Win32 doesn't provide the function you need, the J/Direct Call 
Builder provides easy access to practically the entire Win32 API. J/Direct also 
provides access to commercially provided DLLs and to DLLs that you might write yourself.

<P>In this chapter, you've seen how to use the J/Direct Call Builder to access 
the Win32 API, and you've seen the problems that J/Direct solves. You've also seen a 
few restrictions on calls to DLL functions that are due to problems J/Direct can't solve.

<P>You've learned how to write your own DLL and how to access it through 
J/Direct, a technique that provides you access from Visual J++ 6 code to 
functions you would rather write in a different language.

<P>Finally, you learned how to use J/Direct to solve a problem that was only 
partially solved in an application from <A HREF="ch10a.htm">Chapter 10</A>. J/Direct is a powerful package 
that extends Visual J++ 6 into practically every capability the Win32 operating system 
and many commercial applications provide.

<P>This chapter ends Part II and our discussion of Windows applications. Part 
II has discussed a number of topics regarding Visual J++ 6 windowed 
applications. You've seen how to write generic windowed applications using the Abstract 
Windowing Toolkit (AWT), how to extend AWT capabilities with WFC, and how 
to access DLLs directly. The next part of this book will demonstrate a number of 
new capabilities provided by Visual J++ 6.

<P>As we saw in <A HREF="ch07a.htm">Chapter 7</A>, Dynamic HTML (DHTML) is basically HTML 
with additions that allow scriptable changes to a document at run time. You 
can change nearly everything about the document content at run time by using 
a scripting language such as Microsoft VBScript (Visual Basic, Scripting 
Edition) or Microsoft JScript to access the HTML objects. Every element in the 
document becomes an individually addressable object at run time. Objects are very 
simple, consistent, run-time-programmable entities. In <A HREF="ch07a.htm">Chapter 7</A>, we looked at 
several elements of DHTML, including the DHTML object model, dynamic styles, 
dynamic positioning, and dynamic content. In this chapter, we'll take a look 
at another key feature of DHTML provided by Microsoft Internet Explorer 
4.0&#8212;data binding. 

</P>
<P>In <A HREF="ch13a.htm">Chapter 13</A>, we saw how the scripting platform can be changed 
from server side to client side, thus moving the data to the client side for greater 
user interactivity and performance. Users are able to filter and sort data on the 
client side without having to take round-trips to the server. Additionally, users 
can page through a form displaying a single record at a time without having to 
take a round-trip to the server each time. Not only does this work for viewing 
and navigating through data, it also works for recordsets that need to be 
updatable so that the user can add, edit, and delete records where necessary.

</P>
<P>All this actually occurs through data binding. Microsoft Visual InterDev 
6.0 makes it easy to incorporate data binding into your applications via the 
development environment using the Scripting Object Model, 
<I>Recordset</I> objects, 
design-time controls, and DHTML so that you don't have to be concerned 
with the internals of how data binding is implemented.

</P>
<P>In this chapter, we'll take a look at data binding both in theory and 
in practice. We'll look at how to use this technique within and outside 
the Visual InterDev environment&#8212;meaning with or without 
<I>Recordset</I> objects and design-time controls. Exploring the internals of data binding will give you more insight into how this mechanism works and into the endless possibilities 
for using it within your business applications. We'll start with the theory and 
then get into some code samples that illustrate how to apply data binding in 
your applications.

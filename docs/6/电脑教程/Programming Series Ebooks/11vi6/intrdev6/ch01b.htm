<A NAME="7"><H1>Visual InterDev 6.0</H1></A>
<P>Visual InterDev 6 adds to the strengths of Visual InterDev 1 by providing 
a graphical editor, powerful new development tools, new object-based 
language extensions complete with events, and much more. Visual InterDev 6 brings 
the development methodology available with Microsoft Visual Basic to the 
Web development process. You can glimpse the power of the Visual InterDev 
6 integrated development environment (IDE) in Figure 1-1.

</P>
<P>
<!-- CAPTION --><B>Figure 1-1.</B> <I>The Visual InterDev 6 IDE provides many new features that let 
you be more productive when developing applications.</I><!-- /CAPTION -->

</P>
<P>As a member of the Microsoft visual tools family, Visual InterDev 6 
was designed from the ground up for developing, deploying, and managing 
Web applications; for authoring and debugging ASP Web pages and HTML 
pages; for building VBScript and JScript applications; for achieving and 
maintaining database integration with Web applications; and as a connection point for 
Web authors to Microsoft Visual Studio.

</P>
<P>Visual InterDev now includes the following core features:

</P>
<UL>
<P><LI><B>Site Designer</B> To quickly prototype Web sites, use the 
graphical Site Designer. In the Site Designer, you can create pages, links, 
navigation features, hierarchichal structures, and more&#8212;all with an 
easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>Cascading style sheets (CSS)</B> You can edit style sheets easily 
in the CSS editor. You can create or modify style sheets for a set of 
Web pages. You can even preview any page to see how it would look 
if a style sheet were applied.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>WYSIWYG page editor</B> This new editor includes Design 
view, which lets you edit and create content in a WYSIWYG 
workspace. In addition to Design view, other views such as Script and 
Preview make writing, viewing, and debugging easier.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>Statement completion</B> Statement completion helps you 
create error-free script statements by presenting you with the names of 
all available methods and properties when you type in an object name.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>Data environment</B> You can now create and modify 
data-related objects in a single location&#8212;the graphical data environment. In 
the data environment, you can also drag and drop objects onto ASP 
Web pages to automatically create data-bound controls at design 
time. Oracle users will be pleased to hear that the data environment 
provides the same advanced support for Oracle as it does for 
Microsoft SQL Server.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>Data-bound design-time controls</B> Design-time controls offer 
you a richer, more functional, and aesthetically pleasing interface 
for creating data-enriched pages. Data-bound controls make it 
simple to incorporate data into your ASP or HTML pages that can &quot;talk&quot; 
to a database. The controls included with this version of Visual 
InterDev allow you to target a wide range of browsers or to narrow 
your focus to take advantage of the unique features of Microsoft 
Internet Explorer 4.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>Dynamic HTML</B> Visual InterDev 6 supports Dynamic 
HTML (DHTML) in Internet Explorer 4 and other DHTML-capable 
browsers. The Visual InterDev 6 editor helps you create script for 
DHTML objects and events by presenting statement completion options 
for the object model and by displaying the object model hierarchy in 
the Navigation pane in Script view. As well as scripting directly to the 
Internet Explorer 4 object model, you can choose to have your 
design-time controls create client-side data-binding script.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>Developer isolation</B> You can work on local versions of 
project files, which gives you the ability to test and debug your files 
before updating the master server. You can also work in master mode, 
in which files are saved both locally and to the master server.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>Debugging tools</B> Visual InterDev 6 comes with a debugger 
that helps you test and debug script and Java components. You can 
use the debugger with VBScript and JScript, as well as with 
applications written in Sun Microsystems' Java and run using the Microsoft 
Java Virtual Machine.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>Deployment</B> The ability to build and distribute components 
and packages from your production server is another important 
feature of Visual InterDev 6.

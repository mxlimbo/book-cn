<P>In this final chapter, we'll finish our look at security with a topic that will 
become increasingly important and necessary over the next few years&#8212;the 
role of digital certificates as a form of user authentication. With organizations 
deploying extranets to tighten relationships with business partners, proper 
user authentication is critical. As the complexity of extranet applications 
increases and the sensitivity of the data being exchanged increases, organizations 
are looking beyond usernames and passwords for their user authentication 
mechanisms. Digital certificates can provide a more robust form of user 
authentication since they are installed into a user's browser and therefore tie 
authentication to an individual's PC rather than to a username and password that can be 
easily given out to others.

</P>
<P>The Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack includes Microsoft 
Certificate Server. This product allows organizations to become their own 
certification authority by managing the issuance, revocation, and renewal of digital 
certificates. These types of application are typically deployed in either intranets, 
extranets, or e-commerce applications where the data being exchanged is sensitive 
and can be accessed only by authorized individuals. Features in the Microsoft 
Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 Web server itself also allow for a more granular 
level of security setting than was previously possible in IIS 3.0 and earlier 
versions. This includes various configuration settings for how the Web server 
handles client-side certificates.

</P>
<P>In this chapter, we'll start with some short background theory on 
public-key infrastructures and certification authorities and then progress through 
a discussion of Certificate Server, server-side and client-side certificates, and 
finally how to work with Active Server Pages (ASP) code to access both 
client-side certificates and Certificate Server functionality. At the end of this chapter, 
you'll be able to write applications using Microsoft Visual InterDev 6.0 that can 
leverage the full functionality of Microsoft Certificate Server and provide 
powerful user-authentication measures for your Web applications.

<H1>Acknowledgments</H1>

</P>
<P>We'd like to thank all the staff at Microsoft Press and the 
Microsoft Visual InterDev Product group for all their excellent support and 
encouragement throughout this project. We would particularly like to extend our sincere 
thanks to Eric Stroo, Devon Musgrave, David Clark, Anne Hamilton, David Lazar, 
and Greg Leake. Without your patience and cooperation, this book would not 
have been possible.

</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><I>Nick Evans, Ken Spencer, and Ken Miller</I>


</P>
<P>My sincere thanks and appreciation go to my wife, Michele, and my 
sons, Andrew and David, for allowing me to spend time on this project and for 
supporting me every step of the way. 

</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><I>Nick Evans</I>


</P>
<P>I would like to extend many thanks to my wife, Trisha, and my two sons, 
Jeffrey and Kenny. They have continued to support me over the years in my 
writing efforts and without their encouragement, projects like this would not have 
been possible.

</P>
<P>To Ken Miller, who has been my business partner in one way or 
another for many years: thanks for your support and help. You've always been 
there to help with whatever task needs to be done, and I really appreciate it.

</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><I>Ken Spencer</I>


</P>
<P>To every conference attendee who's asked a question and every reader 
who's written, e-mailed, phoned, or faxed: thank you for reminding me that no 
matter how good the tool or how well it is understood, real-world 
practitioners routinely encounter worthwhile problems for which the answer is not 
obvious. Trying to solve these problems keeps me entertained and employed!

</P>
<P>To my son Jeffrey, in whose eyes I see that wonderment at 
technology that first got me interested in computers: thanks for reminding me how 
much fun exploring the unknown can be.

<A NAME="11"><H1>Design-Time Controls</H1></A>
<P>Design-time controls are an important feature of Visual InterDev. They 
provide all the benefits of component software as provided by standard ActiveX 
controls, such as plug-and-play functionality and visual editing at design 
time. However, design-time controls generate HTML-based content, which is 
viewable on any platform and any browser. Design-time controls can also 
generate the server-side or client-side scripting required to accomplish simple or 
complex tasks within a Web site. In essence, they are visual helper components 
that help you construct dynamic Web applications based on HTML, client script, 
and server script.

</P>
<P>It is hard to overstate the importance of design-time controls for 
Visual InterDev. This product derives maximum extensibility using design-time 
controls, given that third-party software vendors and corporations can 
seamlessly extend the tool with custom design-time controls to add specialized 
functionality. Design-time controls can be developed in any language that supports 
COM, such as C, C++, Java, and Visual Basic. Visual InterDev 6 can also host Java 
applet design-time controls.

</P>
<P>Visual InterDev 6 builds on Microsoft's ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) 
foundation by providing special design-time controls that generate much of 
the server-side scripting, including the ADO calls necessary to establish 
database connections within a Web site, perform queries, and display results. In 
many cases, you can use the design-time controls to create data-driven Web sites 
with little additional programming required. Visual InterDev 6 enables you to 
view and develop directly in Active Server scripting using the ADO component 
for maximum flexibility.

</P>
<P>The new design-time controls included in Visual InterDev 6 are 
designed to reduce the time it takes you to build applications. The new controls are 
more granular than those included in Visual InterDev 1. For instance, now you 
have not only data controls like the new Recordset control, but also Button, 
Textbox, Listbox, and other controls that let you pull them together like components 
in a Visual Basic application.

</P>
<P>Microsoft supplies a growing set of design-time controls on its 
Visual InterDev Web site (at 
<I><A TARGET="_window2" HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vinterdev/">http://msdn.microsoft.com/vinterdev/</A></I>), in effect 
allowing the live upgrading of the tool with new functionality. And over time 
independent software vendors (ISVs) will also provide hundreds of design-time 
controls compatible with Visual InterDev, just as hundreds of ActiveX controls 
(OCXs) are now available for use with Visual Basic. Visual InterDev also supports 
standard ActiveX controls as a way to extend Web pages with client-side 
software components that execute within the browser.

<A NAME="9"><H1>Visual InterDev and Windows DNA</H1></A>
<P>Visual InterDev 6 is part of Microsoft's Windows DNA (Distributed 
interNet Applications architecture). Windows DNA includes all the tools, servers, 
middleware, and database support required for building high-powered, 
integrated applications. Windows DNA is designed to address the various aspects of 
a distributed system such as a client/server or Web solution.

</P>
<P>Visual InterDev is based on Microsoft's powerful Web application 
development framework, the Active Server framework, which enables Active 
Server scripting. Active Server scripting is script logic that is embedded in Web 
pages but that executes on the Web server instead of in the browser. Active 
Server scripting can be used to create Web applications with advanced server-side 
processing, including multitier Web applications that can use components 
developed in languages such as Visual Basic, Visual C++, and Visual J++. The use 
of server-side components also makes it easier to integrate internal legacy 
systems within an Internet or intranet solution while preserving all the benefits of 
Web technology&#8212;open standards, cost-effective deployment, cross-platform 
browsing, and low-bandwidth access. Finally, Visual InterDev includes 
integrated client-side scripting tools, and it is extensible by third-party components 
such as Java applets and ActiveX controls that can be added to Web pages and 
integrated using the Visual InterDev scripting tools.

</P>
<P>Even though writing Active Server scripts with Visual InterDev is 
relatively easy, the scripts provide a powerful environment for Internet and intranet 
applications. For example, you can incorporate sophisticated functionality 
through Active Server components.

</P>
<P>Active Server components provide the ability to process data and 
generate useful information, which extends the capabilities of the Web site. For 
example, using Visual InterDev, you can easily integrate server-side 
components written in Java, Visual Basic (4 or later), C, C++, or other languages that 
can create Component Object Model (COM) components. The Active Server 
framework allows these components to be tightly integrated into the Web 
application as either out-of-process components (EXEs), in-process components 
(DLLs), or remote components that leverage Distributed COM (DCOM) for 
multitier applications (remote EXEs). Server-side components can be limited to a 
page or globally accessible throughout an application so that a single instance 
can be shared by all users. Server-side components can also provide an 
effective way to integrate legacy systems directly into a Web application.

</P>
<A NAME="10"><H2>Active Server Pages</H2></A>
<P>An ASP file consists of straight ASCII text in one or more of three forms: 
text, HTML, or script. An ASP Web page is an HTML page that contains 
server-side scripting. Server-side scripts are designated with an opening (&lt;%) tag and 
a closing (%&gt;) tag and are processed before the page is sent to the browser. 
The following code demonstrates a simple ASP Web page that contains 
server-side scripting and HTML.

</P>
<P><PRE>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;%FOR  i=3 TO 7%&gt;
&lt;FONT SIZE=&lt;%=i%&gt;&gt;
Hello World!&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;% Next %&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</PRE>

</P>
<P>In this example, a simple loop is performed to display 
<I>Hello World!</I> in an increasing font size within an HTML page.

</P>
<P>When a user requests a URL with an ASP filename extension, the 
Active Server engine reads through the file from top to bottom, executing any 
commands and then sending pure HTML back to the user's browser.

</P>
<P>Active Server scripting is completely integrated with HTML pages. 
To enable the Active Server engine to read a file, all you have to do is give the 
file an .asp file extension. Thus, you can change the extension of an existing 
HTML file from .htm to .asp to easily make it an ASP Web page. You can then 
make the HTML dynamic by adding Active Server script to the ASP pages. The 
host language of Active Server scripting is VBScript. However, you can use 
the &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tags to include scripts from other scripting languages, such as 
Perl and JScript.

</P>
<P>Visual InterDev 6 enhances ASP by adding a server-side run-time 
library. This run-time library is implemented in JScript in the initial release of 
Visual InterDev 6. It is scheduled to move to a series of COM components in a 
future update to Visual InterDev.

</P>
<P>The run-time library provides an object-based language interface. 
Design-time controls, which we'll discuss in the next section, are implemented by 
the run-time library and can be addressed as objects. The run-time library also 
makes it easy to do remote scripting from a browser to the server. This lets script 
in the browser call script functions on the server, which can improve the 
performance of your application.

<P>Within Microsoft Visual InterDev 6.0, you have access to the Microsoft 
Visual Database Tools for creating and managing your data-driven applications. 
The Visual Database Tools are available in Visual InterDev 6.0, Microsoft Visual 
J++ 6.0, Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, and Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0, Enterprise 
Editions. To start using the Visual Database Tools, all you need to do is create a 
Web project or a database project within Visual InterDev and add a data 
connection to the project.

</P>
<P>There are four main components to the Visual Database Tools. They 
are listed and defined below. This chapter will cover all of them, as well as 
database projects.

</P>
<UL>
<P><LI><B>Data View</B>  The Data View allows you to view live connections 
to the databases in your Web projects and to work with the 
objects within each database. Objects available include database 
diagrams, tables, views, stored procedures, and triggers.
</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>Database Designer</B>  The Database Designer allows you to 
create, edit, or delete database objects. You can also create database 
diagrams to visualize the structure of your database tables and 
their relationships.
</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>Query Designer</B>  The Query Designer allows you to create 
SQL commands using a visual interface and to view and edit the 
results of your queries.
</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>Source Code Editor</B> The source code editor allows you to 
edit stored procedures and triggers. It also allows you to execute, 
debug, and view stored procedure results.
</LI></P>
</UL>




<P>The combination of these four Visual Database Tools enables you to 
create and manage your entire database environment within the familiar Visual 
InterDev IDE. With the Visual Database Tools, you can:

</P>
<UL>
<P><LI>Connect to and explore any ODBC-compliant database
</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Create and modify Microsoft SQL Server databases by using 
database diagrams
</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Design, execute, and save complex queries
</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Add, update, and delete data stored in database tables
</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Design objects&#8212;such as tables, triggers, and stored procedures&#8212;in SQL Server and Oracle databases
</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Drag database objects onto a design surface&#8212;such as an 
HTML template form&#8212;and then drop to bind controls to those objects
</LI></P>
</UL>




<P>An excellent feature of the Visual Database Tools is that they provide 
a consistent visual interface that allows you to work with all 
ODBC-compliant databases in the same way. Thus, for the most part you don't need to be 
aware of any differences from one database to another. There are some special 
considerations, however, when you are working with SQL Server and Oracle 
databases. The Visual Database Tools provide extended functionality for 
these databases, and in some areas you need to be aware of the differences 
when working with one database or another. Examples include the differences in 
the data types supported by each database (noticeable when working with 
Database Designer), and the slight differences in the SQL syntax (noticeable 
when working with the Query Designer).

</P>
<P>Table 12-1 describes the Visual InterDev features that work for 
different databases. Most Visual Database Tools support any database that is 
supported by an ODBC 3 driver. The last three features work only with SQL Server 6.5 
(or later) or Oracle 7 (or later).

</P>
<P><div class="note"><blockquote>
<B>Note</B><HR>To work with Visual InterDev's Database Designer on 
SQL Server 6.5 databases, you need to apply SQL Server Service Pack 1 
to the database.

<P>In Visual InterDev 1.0, extended functionality&#8212;such as the ability to 
create databases, to create and modify tables, and to create database 
diagrams&#8212;was only provided for SQL Server databases. In Visual InterDev 6.0, this 
functionality is also provided for Oracle databases. This is an important 
enhancement to Visual InterDev, since many Web-enabled corporate applications are 
being created with extant Oracle systems for the back-end database.

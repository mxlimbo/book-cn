<A NAME="34"><H1>Using the Integrated Development Environment</H1></A>
<A NAME="35"><H1>The Visual InterDev IDE and Project System</H1></A>
<P>The Microsoft Visual InterDev 6 integrated development environment (IDE) 
is much like the one provided by Microsoft Visual Basic. The interface 
provides a drag-and-drop environment, a Toolbox, a Task List, and a built-in 
WYSIWYG editor. The menus and toolbars have changed from those in Visual InterDev 
1, along with almost every other part of the working environment.

</P>
<P>Users of Microsoft development tools will be immediately familiar with 
the new IDE, and new users should find it intuitive and easy to use. The IDE 
provides an integrated, global work area for Visual InterDev Web projects. You 
can open multiple projects simultaneously within the work area. For example, 
you might want to create a Visual InterDev Web page for use in one project and 
then open another project and reuse the same page. Opening both projects in 
the IDE allows you to simultaneously test and modify those projects.

</P>
<A NAME="36"><H2>Views and Windows</H2></A>
<P>Visual InterDev 6 includes several views in its main window for working 
with HTML and Active Server Pages (ASP) Web pages:

</P>
<UL>
<P><LI><B>Design view</B> Displays the page in WYSIWYG view, almost as 
you would see it in a browser. You can create and modify pages in this view.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>Quick view</B> Displays pages as they appear in Internet Explorer 
4. However, server script does not execute and data-bound 
controls (DTCs) do not display data.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>Source view</B> Displays the source code for pages. Objects such 
as DTCs and HTML intrinsic controls are shown as they appear in 
a rendered Web page. Pages can be created and modified in this view.
</LI></P>
</UL>




<P>In the Design and Source views, the HTML Outline window, which 
you can access in the bottom left corner of the IDE, shows the HTML tags for 
the particular Web page you are viewing. You can create and modify pages by 
using this window.

</P>
<P>In Source view only, the Script Outline window shows the 
properties, events, and methods for the objects on the viewed Web page.

</P>
<P>Figure 2-1 shows the IDE in Source view displaying the script for a 
page. You change the view in the IDE by clicking a different tab at the bottom of 
the current view.

</P>
<A NAME="37"><H3>The Project Explorer window</H3></A>
<P>The Visual InterDev 6 IDE includes a main Project Explorer window that 
lets you view and navigate a Web site using the Windows Explorer-based 
metaphor. The Project Explorer presents the entire site, including the site's content 
(such as HTML pages, GIF and JPG images, controls and applets, Active Server 
script files, and other files) and its complete subdirectory structure. Displaying a 
hierarchical list of the items in a Visual InterDev project or solution (which 
we'll discuss soon), the Project Explorer provides you with a window into your 
project and serves as your central point for working with file and data type objects. 
Take another look at Figure 2-1 to see an example of the Project Explorer 
displaying a project's structure.

</P>
<P>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f02lh01x.htm')"> <IMG SRC="images/f02lh01.JPG" width=404 height=291 border=0 ALT="Click to view at full size."> </A>
</P>
<P>
<!-- CAPTION --><B>Figure 2-1.</B> <I>Visual InterDev's integrated development environment provides multiple ways into your project, including three main views and various windows depicting information and enabling you to modify the project.</I><!-- /CAPTION -->

</P>
<P>The Project Explorer interface is quite intuitive. You can drag items 
from Project Explorer and drop them into the editor and you can drag items 
from Windows Explorer and drop them in Project Explorer. Project Explorer 
also features a context menu that you can access by right-clicking any item in 
the window.

</P>
<P>To make items in Project Explorer active, select the item with the 
mouse or move the cursor. Once an item is active, you can rename it, display its 
properties, and take other actions. Note also that Project Explorer is 
automatically updated every time you change a setting, insert or change a file, or perform 
any action with Developer Studio. Project Explorer actions work just like those 
in Windows Explorer. For instance, to copy a file, you must hold down the 
Control key when you drag and drop the file. If you do not hold down the 
Control key, the file will be moved instead of copied. You can rename a file by 
clicking on the file and pressing F2 or by right-clicking the file and selecting 
Rename. You can also rename a file by clicking it once, waiting a second, and then 
clicking it again.

</P>
<P>You can also select multiple items in the window by using the same 
techniques used in Windows Explorer. To select multiple contiguous items, 
click the first item and then, while holding down the Shift key, click the last item 
of the group you want to select. You can also use either the up or down 
arrow key with the Shift key to select contiguous items. Select multiple 
noncontiguous items by clicking the first item and then, while holding down the Ctrl 
key, clicking any additional items you want in the selection. You can expand 
and collapse the project lists and folders in the project by clicking the + or 
- icon to the left of the project name or item. If you want to edit or examine a 
particular element of the site, double-click the file. Visual InterDev will display 
the Open File dialog box, asking you if you want to retrieve a working copy or 
open the file in read-only mode. You can also check the Use As Default 
Response check box to make your answer the default for future files. If you select 
Get Working Copy, the file is retrieved from the site, copied to your workstation, 
and opened in the appropriate editor for that file type. Once you make the 
desired changes, you can save the changes locally or save the file on the Web server.

</P>
<P>You can reset your default answer by using Tools|Options and 
displaying the Projects|Web Projects properties. The options under When Opening 
A File control what happens when you double-click a file in Project Explorer.

</P>
<P>Finally, you can also preview a page in a browser by right-clicking the 
page in Project Explorer and selecting View In Browser or Browse With.

</P>
<A NAME="38"><H3>The Properties window</H3></A>
<P>The Properties window lists the design-time properties for selected objects 
and their current settings. As you work with objects, the Properties window will 
be updated continually to display the current properties for the current object. 
As you change properties, the changes are applied immediately.

</P>
<P>Figure 2-2 shows the Properties window, containing the properties for 
the Textbox design-time control.

</P>
<P>You can display the properties in a category format by clicking the 
Categorized button on the Properties window toolbar.

</P>
<P>The first property shown in the Properties window in Figure 2-2 is 
Custom. You can click the ellipsis to the right of Custom, or click the Property 
Pages button (that is, the third button) on the Properties window toolbar, to 
make Visual InterDev 6 display the Properties page for the object. Figure 2-3 
shows the Custom property pages for the Textbox object shown in Figure 2-2.

</P>

top of the Properties window to display the properties for another item.

</P>
<A NAME="39"><H3>The Data View window</H3></A>
<P>Visual InterDev 6 has a new Data View window display, as shown in Figure 2-4.

</P>
<P>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f02lh04x.htm')"> <IMG SRC="images/f02lh04.JPG" width=404 height=291 border=0 ALT="Click to view at full size."> </A>
</P>
<P>
<!-- CAPTION --><B>Figure 2-4.</B> <I>The new Data View window has been enhanced by the addition of its own toolbar and the enrichment of its context menu.</I><!-- /CAPTION -->

</P>
<P>Data View is available at any time in a project's Data Environment. 
(See <A HREF="ch12a.htm">Chapter 12</A> for more information about the Data Environment.) You can use 
Data View for many different tasks, including:

</P>
<UL>
<P><LI>Providing a view into a database that your project has a connection to

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Supplying tables to drop into Query Designer

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Providing access to the Stored Procedure and Trigger editors

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Copying SQL Script to the clipboard

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Displaying the properties for a table or a column

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Providing access to database diagrams and table design features
</LI></P>
</UL>




<A NAME="40"><H3>The Toolbox</H3></A>
<P>The Toolbox displays design-time controls, ActiveX controls, Java applets, 
Java Beans, HTML intrinsic controls, and HTML and code scraps. The elements 
displayed in the Toolbox are based on the editor you are using and are 
enabled only when the associated editor is active.

</P>
<P>While each Visual Studio application has its own default set of 
Toolbox items, the Toolbox always contains the pointer tool. The pointer is used to 
resize or move a control that has been drawn on a form. 

</P>
<P>You can work in the following ways with the Toolbox: 

</P>
<UL>
<P><LI>Drag Toolbox items and controls from the Toolbox and drop 
them onto pages in one of the editors. 

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Double-click a Toolbox item to insert it at the current cursor 
position in the page currently open in an editor.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Place new items in the Toolbox by dropping them onto the 
Toolbox. For example, you can drag an item, such as an ActiveX control, 
from the Windows Explorer and drop it onto the Toolbox. You can 
also drag text from the editor to the Toolbox, thereby creating a 
named code fragment that you can reuse. And you can paste items from 
the clipboard onto the Toolbox by right-clicking the Toolbox and 
selecting Paste.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Rearrange items on a Toolbox tab by dragging them to a 
new location.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Delete an item from the Toolbox.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>View Toolbox items in a list view format by selecting List 
View (which is the default setting) from the context menu when you 
right-click the Toolbox window.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Customize the Toolbox by creating tabs for custom groups that 
contain Toolbox items. 
</LI></P>
</UL>




<P>Note that items that you add to the Toolbox and changes that you 
make there appear only on the machine on which they were added or created.

</P>
<P>You can add your own tabs to the Toolbox by following these steps:

</P>
<OL>
<P><LI> Right-click the Toolbox.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI> Select Add Tab from the context menu.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI> Type the name for the new tab.
</LI>
</P>
</OL>


<P>As mentioned, the Toolbox can be extended by adding other controls 
or text. You can add items to the Toolbox by dragging them and dropping 
them onto the Toolbox. You generally add ActiveX controls to the Toolbox by 
using the Customize interface:

</P>
<OL>
<P><LI> Right-click the Toolbox.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI> Select Customize Toolbox from the context menu.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI> Click the check box beside the component you want to add. 
You can also click the Browse button to look for the component's 
executable file.
</LI>
</P>
</OL>


<A NAME="41"><H2>Projects and Solutions</H2></A>
<P>Your work with Visual InterDev 6 will be based upon 
<I>projects</I> and <I>solutions</I>. There are two kinds of projects you can create with Visual 
InterDev&#8212;Web projects and database projects, both of which we'll discuss in this book. A 
project is a collection of all the files in a project, the settings for that project when 
it was last saved, and the configuration of Developer Studio when the project 
was last saved. 

</P>
<P>A Visual InterDev 6 Web project consists of, simply put, a Web site. 
Unlike with traditional client-server tools, when you open a Web project with 
Visual InterDev, you are actually opening a live view of a site as it exists on the 
Web server. The server can be a personal development server running on 
your workstation, but more typically it is a staging or production Web server 
running on a network. The IDE is thus a complete Web site management tool that 
lets you easily modify the structure of a site (for example, by adding a 
subdirectory) and edit, add, move, rename, and delete files and folders on the site.

</P>
<P>A solution is a container for projects. A solution might contain only 
one project, or it might contain multiple projects. The information for a solution 
is stored in an .sln file named for the solution. For instance, a solution 
named 32XStuff has a solution file named 32Xstuff.sln. This file is stored in the 
parent directory of the first project in the solution. The &quot;<A HREF="ch02f.htm#63">File Types</A>&quot; section at the 
end of this chapter contains more information on project-related and 
solution-related file types.

</P>
<P>Multiple projects can be opened simultaneously in a solution. 
Solutions in Visual InterDev 6 provide the same context as that provided by the 
Workspace in Visual InterDev 1. If there's only one project in a directory and the 
solution file has the same name, when you open a project file (*.v?p) the solution file 
is automatically opened. This enables to you to have a project participate 
in multiple solutions.

</P>
<P>The project model is multiuser, allowing multiple developers to work 
on the same site simultaneously. Check-in and check-out capabilities are 
provided via integration with the Microsoft Visual SourceSafe version control system. 
The project system uses the Microsoft FrontPage server-side extensions, which 
are available for all major Web servers in both the Microsoft Windows NT and 
UNIX environments. Visual InterDev users and FrontPage users can also work 
together, simultaneously, on the same sites.

</P>
<P>The IDE makes it easy for you to create new sites via wizard 
technology and to import content, including entire directory trees, into existing sites. 
You can also browse pages in the project directly from the IDE. This is an 
important productivity feature because you do not have to pull up a separate 
Web browser window to view a site under construction. The View in Browser 
option uses the default browser on your system. When you use this feature, the 
page you are viewing actually runs in the browser, including all Java applets, 
ActiveX controls, ActiveX documents, scripting, style sheets, and HTML/DHTML 
features such as tables and frames.

</P>
<P>The IDE also provides a Browse With feature so that you can set up 
another browser (for example, Netscape Navigator) and with three mouse clicks 
preview any page of a project in a separate window running that browser.

</P>
<P>And you can use the IDE's text editor or HTML editor to edit files in 
your projects. By default, the IDE associates itself with many file extensions in 
Windows, including: 

</P>
<UL>
<P><LI><B>*.txt</B>  Text files

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>*.asp</B>  Active Server Pages files

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>*.html</B>  HTML files

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>*.htm</B>  HTML files

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>*.java</B>  Java application source files

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>*.bat</B>  DOS batch files

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>*.cmd</B>  OS/2 and NT command files
</LI></P>
</UL>




<P>To use the IDE's editors to open one of these files, right-click on the 
file from within Windows Explorer and choose Edit With Visual Studio. If you 
are using Visual InterDev and you have a file in your project that has an 
extension that the IDE does not recognize, select the file in Project Explorer, 
right-click it, and then choose the Open With... command. The Open With... dialog 
box will display all of the IDE's internal editors so that you can choose one and 
make it the default editor for that file type.

</P>
<P>If you want to open a project's file without loading the whole 
project, choose the File|Open File command. 

</P>
<P>The IDE can also open Word files, Excel files, or any file type that 
can be hosted as an active document. Use the File|Open File command to 
open these files. The IDE will transform to host Word, but you'll still have all 
your docking windows available. This is useful when using Word to 
document specifications or schedules in a project, and you can read or update 
them without leaving the IDE.

</P>
<A NAME="42"><H2>Using Menus and the Keyboard</H2></A>
<P>There are often several ways to accomplish a given task within Developer 
Studio. Standard Windows-based elements such as toolbars, menus, context menus, 
and drag-and-drop operations are available for different tasks and sometimes for 
the same task. The Developer Studio menus contain many options for Visual 
InterDev projects. You can use the menus to open a Web site or a file, insert a data 
source into a project, or rearrange the windows displayed within Developer Studio. 
Be aware that Developer Studio menus can change, depending on the other 
applications you have installed on your system. For example, if you have 
Microsoft Visual J++ installed, you will see Build, Debug, and other options that 
are specific to Visual J++. 

</P>
<P>The material in this chapter, unless otherwise stated, assumes a 
default installation of Visual InterDev with no additional Developer 
Studio-hosted products installed.

</P>
<P>As you move around within Developer Studio, notice also that the 
IDE's menus change in response to your actions. For instance, when you place 
the cursor in a file, several new options appear on the Edit menu. Other 
menu options are also added and removed as the context of the current 
environment changes.

</P>
<P>The next few paragraphs describe the various menus.

</P>
<P>The File menu is the far-left menu and is used for most file-related 
tasks, such as creating new files, projects, and solutions; opening existing files, 
projects, and solutions; and, of course, saving files, projects, and solutions. The File 
menu also contains other utility commands for file-related tasks.

</P>
<P>The Edit menu contains commands related to manipulating text and 
other attributes within an Edit window. For instance, the standard Cut, Copy, 
Paste, and Undo commands are located here. The commands on the Edit menu 
can change, depending on where the cursor is when the Edit menu is selected. 
For instance, the bottom part of the menu will show the Advanced and Insert 
File As Text commands when the cursor is located in an HTML page, but you 
won't see those entries when you are editing a text file.

</P>
<P>The View menu contains commands that change Visual InterDev's 
display characteristics. These include the Refresh command for updating the display 
and the View Links command, which displays the Link View for the current 
page and the Broken Links report for troubleshooting links in a site. The View 
menu also includes the View In Browser and Browse With commands for 
previewing Web pages. 

</P>
<P>The Project menu contains commands for inserting new items into 
the current solution and performing general project-level actions. A command 
can be as simple as one that inserts a new file into the current project or can be 
more complex, such as one that inserts an entire project into the current solution. 
The Project menu also contains commands that work on either an entire project 
or an entire Web site, such as the Deploy Solution command. 

</P>
<P>The Tools menu provides direct access to setting Visual InterDev 
options and customizing the Toolbox. You will also find the View Links On 
WWW command on the Tools menu. 

</P>
<P>The Window menu contains items familiar to anyone who has used 
a multiple-document interface (MDI) application such as Microsoft Word or 
Microsoft Excel.

</P>
<P>Although context-sensitive help is available on a seemingly endless 
array of subjects throughout Visual InterDev simply by pressing the F1 key, the 
Help menu also provides access to this information. 

</P>
<P>You can customize Visual InterDev menus with these steps:

</P>
<OL>
<P><LI> Right-click a menu, and select Customize from the context menu.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI> Click the Commands tab to display the Customize dialog box.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI> Select the Command Category that contains the command you need.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI> Select the command you need from the Commands list.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI> Drag the command, and drop it where you want it to appear on 
the menu.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI> Close the Customize dialog box.
</LI>
</P>
</OL>


<P>Regarding the keyboard, several keystrokes are especially useful in 
Visual InterDev. The Esc key will take you from any tool window back to the 
current document window. Pressing Shift-Esc will close any tool window.

</P>
<A NAME="43"><H3>Drag-and-drop actions and popup menus</H3></A>
<P>Developer Studio makes the most of point-and-click technology. The easiest 
way to do almost anything is to either drag-and-drop an element or right-click 
the mouse to display a popup menu. Once you get acquainted with the IDE, 
your productivity will take another big jump over what you can accomplish in 
other environments. Until you become more familiar with Developer Studio, 
experiment with dragging and dropping elements and right-clicking the mouse 
instead of looking through every menu and toolbar. We have documented a lot in 
this book, but we've also left a few pleasant surprises for you to discover.

</P>
<P>You can click the right mouse button at any time to display a 
context-sensitive (popup) menu of frequently used commands relating to the area 
in which you click the mouse. This method works throughout Developer 
Studio in views, Project Explorer, and other areas. For instance, if you right-click 
over an HTML page, the menu shown in Figure 2-5 appears.

</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/f02lh05.GIF" width=139 height=312 BORDER=0>
</P>
<P>
<!-- CAPTION --><B>Figure 2-5.</B> <I>These menu commands work within an HTML page.</I><!-- /CAPTION -->

</P>
<P>Any item on the menu that is not relevant to the current cursor 
position is grayed out, indicating that the item is unavailable. The available items on 
a menu change as you move the cursor. Even within a given window&#8212;say, 
an HTML file&#8212;the popup menu can change. For instance, if you right-click 
a design-time control, the Show Run-Time Text command is available. If you 
right-click anywhere else, the Show Run-Time Text command is not on the menu 
and thus is not available.

</P>
<P>If you right-click over a filename in Project Explorer, the menu shown 
in Figure 2-6 appears.

</P>
<P>We recommend that you spend some time right-clicking around in the 
IDE in different places to familiarize yourself with the available options. Each 
IDE area has a different set of options that are designed to work with the 
particular item you click on. For instance, you can customize a toolbar by right-clicking it.

</P>
<P>Drag-and-drop options also work in many places. You can drop the 
URL for a file into an HTML page by simply grabbing the filename in the File 
View of the Project pane and dropping it into a page in the Edit window. To 
insert a Data Command, just grab the command in Project Explorer and drop it 
into an ASP Web page. It doesn't get any easier than this!

<A NAME="44"><H2>Using the Find Command</H2></A>
<P>The Find dialog box lets you do different types of searches from one 
window. You can use the Find command to search within any of the following:

</P>
<UL>
<P><LI>The current document (the default)

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>All open documents

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>The current selection

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>The current project folder

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Any number of folders that you choose
</LI></P>
</UL>




<P>You can activate Find by pressing Ctrl-F or through Edit|Find and Replace.

</P>
<P>If you want to search in multiple folders, type the paths separated 
by commas in the Look In: combo box. To refresh the results list when you 
are doing a multifile search, click the Find button. To step among the results in 
the results list, press F3. In addition to finding text, you can do automatic 
search-and-replace operations with Find. You can also dock the Find window by 
dragging its title bar to the Project Explorer or another window. Doing this can 
be helpful when you are stepping through large numbers of hits in the results 
list. If you want to hide a column in the results list of the Find window, simply 
drag the divider to the right of the column's heading to size the column down to zero.

</P>
<A NAME="45"><H2>Toolbars</H2></A>
<P>Visual InterDev 6 provides numerous toolbars that are used to accomplish 
different tasks. These toolbars, like the IDE's menus, operate from a standard 
set of commands that are provided by Visual InterDev and Visual Studio. 
The toolbars contain buttons that are shortcuts to some commonly used menu 
items. You only need to click a toolbar button once to activate a task.

</P>
<P>You can customize toolbars by changing their location, adding 
commands, removing commands, resizing them, and more. This allows you to 
customize the interface that Visual InterDev provides.

</P>
<P>You can add commands to toolbars following steps similar to those 
for adding a command to a menu:

</P>
<OL>
<P><LI>Right-click a blank spot on a toolbar, and select Customize from 
the context menu.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Click the Commands tab.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Select the Command Category that contains the command you need.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Select the command you need from the Commands list.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Drag the command, and drop it where you want it to appear on 
the toolbar.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Close the Customize dialog box.
</LI>
</P>
</OL>


<P>To remove commands from a toolbar:

</P>
<OL>
<P><LI>Point the mouse at the item you wish to remove from a toolbar.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Press and hold down the Alt key.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Drag the button from the toolbar into an open area and release it.
</LI>
</P>
</OL>




<P>To move a toolbar, drag the toolbar to another location. You can also 
dock the toolbars to one side of the IDE or to a window. To resize a toolbar, 
grab the corner of a toolbar and drag it to its new size. You can resize any 
toolbar that is not docked. Docked toolbars do not display a title. If you make a 
toolbar shorter, the buttons will wrap and the toolbar will change its aspect ratio 
to accommodate the buttons.

</P>
<A NAME="46"><H2>Configuring the Interface</H2></A>
<P>Developer Studio toolbars and windows are free-floating and dockable. A 
dockable object can be free-floating within the Developer Studio interface or 
docked to one of the borders. For instance, the toolbars that appear at the top of 
Developer Studio are merely docked there. You can click on the double bars of 
a docked toolbar and drag the toolbar, thereby undocking it, as shown with 
the Query toolbar in Figure 2-7 below. You can even drag it to 
the bottom of the window and release it, docking it to the bottom of the 
window frame. Likewise, the Project Explorer window that displays your Web site 
and its files is merely docked. You can drag it from the border or even maximize 
it to fill the entire Developer Studio parent window.

</P>
<P>When you enable a toolbar, by default it floats freely in Developer 
Studio. You can grab a toolbar with the mouse and drag it to any location. When 
you drag a toolbar or a window to a docking location (such as the top of the 
Developer Studio environment), it changes shape to fit that location and the 
title bar for the toolbar disappears. Drag the toolbar into place and drop it to 
complete the docking operation. To make a toolbar free-floating again, simply 
grab it with the mouse and drag it out of a docking location.

</P>
<P>To drag a toolbar that is not docked, place the mouse over the 
toolbar's title bar and then click the left mouse button and drag. To drag a toolbar 
that is docked, place the mouse over the toolbar but outside of any toolbar 
button, and then click the left mouse button and drag. (If you have trouble finding 
a point outside of all toolbar buttons, click the double bars.) If you 
double-click a docked toolbar, it moves to its previous floating position.

</P>

</P>
<P>
<!-- CAPTION --><B>Figure 2-7.</B> <I>The Query toolbar has been undocked and left free-floating.</I><!-- /CAPTION -->

</P>
<P>You can hide a toolbar you don't need by right-clicking a blank spot 
on the toolbars and clicking the toolbar's name on the popup list to deselect 
the toolbar you wish to hide. You can reenable that toolbar by using this 
same method and then selecting the name of the desired toolbar. 

</P>
<P>You can dock windows in the IDE on top of each other by dragging 
the title bar of one docking window to another. To switch among the windows, 
use the tabs that appear at the bottom of the docked set. If you want to separate 
the windows, drag one of the tabs to another location outside the current window. 

</P>
<P>Visual InterDev 6 uses named window layouts for configuration 
information. You can see this in Figure 2-7. Notice the list box just above the right 
end of the Query toolbar? This is the window layout name that we are 
currently using. You can change window layouts by selecting one from the list.

</P>
<P>Visual InterDev 6 has several standard window layouts:

</P>
<UL>
<P><LI><B>Debug</B> Used when Visual InterDev switches to debug mode

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>Design</B> Used in design mode, displays Project Explorer, Data 
View, and the Toolbox

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>DevStudio</B> The normal Developer Studio mode; changes the 
interface to a Visual InterDev 1 look

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>Edit HTML</B> Used when editing HTML; displays Project 
Explorer, HTML outline, and the Properties window

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>Full Screen</B> Hides all windows and displays the edit window 
full screen

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B>Visual Basic</B> Changes the interface to a Visual Basic look and feel
</LI></P>
</UL>




<P>The window layouts are nice because you can reconfigure the 
interface with the click of a mouse. When you wish to flip back to another window 
layout, click again and it's right back. And not only can you quickly change 
the interface, you can create your own named window layouts:

</P>
<OL>
<P><LI>Change the configuration.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Select Define Window Layout from the View menu.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Enter the name for your view.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Click Add.
</LI>
</P>
</OL>




<P>The IDE now supports multiple monitors. Using Windows 98 or 
Windows NT 5, you can place the IDE or its docking windows on a 
secondary monitor. This is especially helpful for debugging because you can have 
your running application on one monitor and your code on the other.

</P>
<P>The IDE supports different keyboard schemes. By default, Visual 
Studio ships with Visual Basic, Developer Studio, and Visual C++ 2 keyboard 
bindings. You can also create your own keyboard scheme by using Tools|Options 
and selecting the Environment/Keyboard node in the tree.

</P>
<A NAME="47"><H2>Task List</H2></A>
<P>The Task List is new for Visual Studio 6. The Task List helps you 
customize, categorize, and manage work associated with your project. The Task List 
does this by displaying your tasks, specially marked comments, named 
shortcuts, warnings, and detected errors. Some errors, such as SmartEditor and 
comment errors, are generated as you type in the Editor window. You can also add 
named shortcuts and other items within the Task List itself at any time. 

</P>
<P>You can display the Task List by pressing Ctrl-Alt-K or by choosing 
Task List from the Other Windows command on the View menu.

</P>
<P>You can add a task to the Task List by taking these steps:

</P>
<OL>
<P><LI>Click the first line in the Description column where it says &quot;Click here to add a new task.&quot;

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Enter the task description.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Click the leftmost column to change the task's priority.
</LI>
</P>
</OL>




<P>You can sort tasks with these steps:

</P>
<OL>
<P><LI>Right-click anywhere in the Task window.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Choose Sort By from the context menu.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Choose the type of sort from the context menu.
</LI>
</P>
</OL>




<P>You can also add shortcuts to a comment in your code and later jump 
to the comment's location in the editor. Figure 2-8 shows the Task List with 
two comments that have shortcuts. You can see the second comment just past 
the Loop command.

</P>
<P>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f02lh08x.htm')"> <IMG SRC="images/f02lh08.JPG" width=404 height=291 border=0 ALT="Click to view at full size."> </A>
</P>
<P>
<!-- CAPTION --><B>Figure 2-8.</B> <I>The Task List can track all types of information and link it to specific locations in files.</I><!-- /CAPTION -->

</P>
<P>You can insert shortcuts to comments using these steps:

</P>
<OL>
<P><LI>Insert a valid comment in the code window.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Right-click the comment, and choose Add Shortcut from the 
context menu.
</LI>
</P>
</OL>




<P>Now you can jump to the location of the comment at any time by 
double-clicking the shortcut icon in the Task List line containing the comment.

</P>
<P>The text editor automatically looks for code comments with tags 
like &quot;TODO&quot; or &quot;HACK&quot; and puts those lines of code on the Task List. To add 
your own comment tags that the editor will scan for, use Tools|Options and 
choose the Environment/Task List node.

</P>
<P>The Task List lets you type in your own tasks and associate them with 
the current solution. When you open that solution in the future, the tasks that 
you entered will be shown. If someone else uses the same solution file, your 
tasks are not shared&#8212;they are saved on your machine only. 

</P>
<P>You can also tie any line of code to a task in the Task List. To tie a line 
of code to a task:

</P>
<OL>
<P><LI>Open the file in the text editor.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Place the cursor on the line you want to tie to a task.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Press Ctrl-K and then Ctrl-H.
</LI>
</P>
</OL>




<P>When the shortcut appears on the task list, click in the description field and 
give it an appropriate name. This is also helpful for marking where you were 
last working in a file or for describing a problem you were trying to solve and 
the next steps to take. 

</P>
<P>You can check off a completed task by clicking the complete box just 
to the left of the task's description.

</P>
<P>You can also filter the tasks that are displayed in the Task List:

</P>
<OL>
<P><LI>Right-click anywhere in the Task window.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Choose Show Tasks from the context menu.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Select the tasks that you want to display.
</LI>
</P>
</OL>




<P>To delete tasks from the Task List:

</P>
<OL>
<P><LI>Right-click the task you want to delete.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Choose Delete Task from the context menu.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Confirm the deletion by answering Yes.
</LI>
</P>

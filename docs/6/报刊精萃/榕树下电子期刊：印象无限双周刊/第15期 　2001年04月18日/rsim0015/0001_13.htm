            A long long time ago<br>
            I can still remember how that music used to make me smile<br>
            And I know If I had my chance that I could make those people dance and may be they'd happy for a while.<br>
            But February made me shiver with every paper I'd deliver.<br>
            Bad news on the doorstep I couldn't take one more step.<br>
            I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowd bride.<br>
            Something touched me deep inside the day the music died.<br>
            So bye-bye , Miss American Pie.<br>
            Drover my Chevy to the levee was dry.<br>
            Them good ole boys were drinkin's whiskey and rye<br>
            Singin' this wil be the day that I die.<br>
            This will be the day that I die<br>
            <br>
            Did you write the book of love and do you have faith in God above?<br>
            If the Bible tells you so.<br>
            Now do you believe in rock and roll?<br>
            Can music save your mortal soul and can you teach me how to dance real slow?<br>
            Well, I know that you're in love with him because I saw you dancin' in the gym.<br>
            You both kicked off your shoes<br>
            Man, I dig those rhythm and blues<br>
            I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck with a pink carnation and a pick-up truck,<br>
            But I knew I was out of luck the day the music died.<br>
            I started singing bye-bye ,Miss American Pie<br>
            Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry.<br>
            Them good ole boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye.<br>
            Singin' this will be the day that I die.<br>
            This'll be the day that I die.<br>
            <br>
            Now for ten years we've been on our own,<br>
            And moss grows fat on a rollin'stone.<br>
            But that's not how it used to be.<br>
            When the jester sang for the king and queen.<br>
            In a coat he borrowed from James Dean<br>
            And a voice that came from you and me.<br>
            Oh and while the king was looking down<br>
            The jester stole his thorny crown.<br>
            The courtroom was adjourned,no verdict was returned.<br>
            And while Lenin read a book on Marx.<br>
            The quartet practiced in the park.<br>
            And we sang dirges in the dark<br>
            The day the music died.<br>
            We are singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie<br>
            Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry<br>
            Them good ole boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye<br>
            Singin' this 'll be the day that I die.<br>
            This'll be the day that I die.<br>
            <br>
            Helter-skelter in the summer swelter,<br>
            The birds flew off with a fallout shelter.<br>
            Eight miles high and fallin' fast,<br>
            It landed foul on the grass.<br>
            The player tried for a forward pass,<br>
            With the jester on the side-lines in a cast.<br>
            Now the half-time air was sweet perfume<br>
            While the sergeants played a marching tune,<br>
            We all got up to dance,but we never got the chance,<br>
            Cause the players tried to take the field.<br>
            The marching band refused to yield,<br>
            Do you recall what was revealed<br>
            The day the music died.<br>
            We started singing bye-bye, Miss American Pie<br>
            Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry<br>
            Them good ole boy were drinkin' whiskey and rye<br>
            Singin' this be the day that I die,<br>
            This 'll be the day that I die.<br>
            <br>
            And there we were all in one place.<br>
            A generation lost in space,<br>
            With no time left to start again.<br>
            So come on,Jack be nimble, Jack be quick,<br>
            Jack Flash sat on a candestick,<br>
            'Cause fire is the devil's only friend.<br>
            And as I watched him on the stage.<br>
            My hands were clenched in first of rage,<br>
            No angel born in hell could break that Satan's spell<br>
            And as the flames climbed high into the night<br>
            To light the sacrificial rite.<br>
            I saw Satan laughing with delight the day the music died.<br>
            He was singing bye-bye , Miss American Pie<br>
            Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry.<br>
            Them good ole boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye.<br>
            Singin' this'll be the day that I die,<br>
            This 'll be the day that I die.<br>
            <br>
            I met a girl who sang the blues and I asked her for some happy news,<br>
            But she just smiled and turned away.<br>
            I went down to the sacred store where I heard the music years before<br>
            But the man there said the music wouldn't play<br>
            And in the streets the children screamed,<br>
            The lovers cried and the poets dreamed,<br>
            Not a word was spoken, the church bells all were broken<br>
            And the three men I admire most, the Father , Son, the Holy Ghost,<br>
            They caught the last train for the coast the day the music died.<br>
            And they were singing bye-bye, Miss American Pie<br>
            Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry.<br>
            Them good ole boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye.<br>
            Singin' this'll be the day that I die,<br>
            This 'll be the day that I die.<br>
            This 'll be the day that I die.<br>

              Right at the top<br>
              There's a beautiful view<br>
              From the top of the mountain<br>
              Every morning I walk towards the edge<br>
              And throw little things off<br>
              Like:<br>
              Car-parts, bottles and cutlery<br>
              Or whatever I find lying around</p>
            <p>It's become a habit<br>
              A way<br>
              To start the day</p>
            <p>I go through all this<br>
              Before you wake up<br>
              So I can feel happier<br>
              To be safe up here with you</p>
            <p>It's real early morning<br>
              No-one is awake<br>
              I'm back at my cliff<br>
              Still throwing things off<br>
              I listen to the sounds they make<br>
              On their way down<br>
              I follow him with my eyes 'till they crash<br>
              Imagine what my body would sound like<br>
              Slamming against those rocks</p>
            <p>When it lands<br>
              Will my eyes<br>
              Be closed or open?</p>
            <p>I go through all this<br>
              Before you wake up<br>

              Sounds go through the muscles<br>
              These abstract wordless movements<br>
              They start off cells that haven't been touched before<br>
              THESE CELLS ARE VIRGINS<br>
              Waking up slowly<br>
              My headphones<br>
              They saved my life<br>
              Your tape<br>
              It lulled me to sleep<br>
              Nothing will be the same</p>
            <p>I'm fast asleep<br>
              I like this resonance<br>
              It elevates me<br>
              I don't recognize myself<br>
              This is very interesting<br>
              My headphones<br>
              They saved my life<br>
              Your tape<br>
              It lulled me to sleep<br>
              I'm fast asleep now<br>
              I'm fast asleep<br>
              My headphones<br>

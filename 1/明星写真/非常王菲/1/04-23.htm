                this moment onwards, in the article that refers to Faye, is no 
                longer regarding her as a singer, no longer Dou Wei's wife, no 
                longer the active and cute tong tong's mum, in here ' Faye Wong' 
                , is a business product, is a brand. This is because the writer 
                will look from the marketing point of view to find out about the

              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Cannot deny 
                that in the local hongkong entertainment scene, its always that 
                its siding with the males and bias against females, however also 
                cannot deny that local hongkong female singers are of a higher 
                caliber than the males. Among the vast green, there's a spot of 
                red , Anita Mui is even more outstanding than the guys, and can 
                be on the same level as them; Sandy Lam firstly, due to her in-born 
                character, always is forever doing her best all the while, forever 
                seems like is only smiling and watching the storm; the only one 
                singer that can rise up to the top and be adored by millions out 
                there, is only Faye Wong ------ when Faye just give a simple smile 
                to the reporter's camera, it will become the headlines in the 
                news, heavenly king maybe is only under the goddess.</span></font></p>

                a brand name , a product. First stage : Wong Jing Wen times --- 
                Product Introduction</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">In the late 
                eighties, Chen Xiao Bao, a musician with many years of experience 
                in this field found Faye who is from China ,and came over to hongkong 
                recently, relying on the good image and beautiful voice, signed 
                a contract and became one of the singers under Xin Yi Bao. In 
                order to let Faye to be easily recognized and be accepted by the 
                hongkong people, Faye Wong is changed name to &quot;Wong Jing 
                Wen&quot;, and was also called herself Shirley, becoming one of 
                our local new female singers. Her debut album was launched in 
                year 1989.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">At that time, 
                Guan Shu Yi is already moving towards sing and dance kind of style 
                and with a wild type of character ,sings the song 'Lovers under 
                the stars lit sky'. Sandy Lam also change her style, her city 
                rhythm wave rush through the whole city. Her record company did 
                not choose for her any of those kind of pop songs and image that 
                was popular at that time, luckily what she got wasn't too far 
                away from that. &quot; Wong Jing Wen&quot; is definetly not a 
                bad album and is a steady debut. Songs like &quot; No choice that 
                day', ' If there's fate', till today still remains as frequent 
                guests in late night programs.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">During this 
                time, though the record company haven't really successfully made 
                &quot; Wong Jing Wen' be very readily accepted by the hongkong 
                people, but least it lets quite a number of music lovers to be 
                familar with this brand &quot;Wong Jing Wen&quot;. At least in 
                the area of product awareness, the record company and the singer 
                have made it !</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">After winning 
                the new comer's award, &quot;Wong Jing Wen&quot; can say makes 
                it to a stepping stone and things gets better and better. Songs 
                like &quot; Everything&quot;, &quot; Continue to wait&quot;, &quot; 
                Thanks to him&quot;, etc makes people realizes her high pitch, 
                R &amp; B are that powerful. The producer also started to discover 
                her voice range ---- as for pitch high or low has some directions, 
                however, as for the expressions to show the feelings for the songs 
                still have some diffculties to catch it. Seniors in this line 
                give their opinions naturally: currently all singers sing songs 
                totally lack of feelings, sing songs is only like to practise 
                between the high notes skies. Its time not only to work hard, 
                we now know that time &quot;Wong Jing Wen&quot; sing works that 
                are not Faye Wong's favourites, its no wonder that the level of 
                involvement definitely will have a deduction then.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Clever Faye 
                finally is not willing to linger in between only the idols and 
                powerful sector, decided to break through herself, thus in 1992, 
                she decided to go to America to upgrade herself for half a year. 
                There's no big news on it . There's only one or two compliations 
                to recap on her songs, but the response turned out to be very 
                good.</span></font></p>

                --- Product Relaunch</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">After returing 
                to Hong Kong, the media naturally used a description like a &quot;total 
                makeover / change&quot; to describe Faye Wong. It was 1992. Anita 
                Mui at that time have not retired yet but her new ideas and concepts 
                are getting less popular ; Sally Yeh always full of feelings and 
                macho label, after blessings and goodbye is good luck and care; 
                Sandy's market estimation was wrong,overestimated the hongkong 
                fans, &quot;Wild Flower&quot; move too fast, fans start to change 
                .....in the end, &quot;Easily Hurt Woman&quot; very easily raised 
                Faye Wong up to the first-line singers, and became very very popular 
                : &quot;Easily Hurt Woman&quot; this song was broadcast over the 
                radio stations for over half a year, when &quot;No Regrets&quot; 
                was released for barely 2 days, and not plug over the stations 
                yet, it was already very familiar with everyone in the streets 
                already! &quot; Liu Fei Fei&quot; also overturn the mainstream 
                style, thus makes &quot; Faye Wong&quot; power even obvious, &quot; 
                Cold War&quot; , this type of &quot;Alternative&quot; music is 
                also saved by her...... under the media support and promotion, 
                the efforts are all really helpful. (Business stations can be 
                said have put in their great efforts.), this made at this time 
                &quot;Faye Wong&quot; like electricity , successfully made up 
                to the top places. No matter big or small shops in the areas also 
                play Cranberries, Cocteau Twins, Tori Amos, Bjork , etc ..type 
                of Faye songs, thus can really prove &quot;Faye Wong&quot; influences. 
                (Until today, Cranberries &quot; No Need to Argue&quot; is still 
                very popular in these areas.)</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Image is always 
                &quot;Faye Wong&quot; most successful area, that is also a very 
                important reason why she can stand out among the others. Dunno 
                know if its because she's been abroad that brings the confidence, 
                after Faye Wong returned to HongKong, she seems like beginning 
                to realize her own uniqueness. She matched a black netted top 
                with a very short leather skirt for &quot;Coming Home&quot; as 
                cover for a prelude. At a certain award ceremony, whole transparent 
                top plus a shorts for a start, she formely became our local HongKong 
                fashion sense of direction, also became foreign countries fashion 
                stage, those received are mostly come from &quot;Ying Lun Bing 
                Tao&quot; style. Luckily Faye Wong herself has her own qualifications, 
                if not at that time she will be wearing a bad name.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Image is only 
                one factor, music is still the main subject. After a few popular 
                albums, Faye Wong met DouWei in the music .....from then Faye 
                Wong found herself, &quot;Wong Jing Wen&quot; formely disappear 
                from the music scene, Shirley only have a surname 'Guan', Surname 
                with 'Wong' is called FAYE. After &quot; Good to oneself&quot; 
                , besides the music is good to faye herself, it also move many 
                of the music judges, business and art received both successful 
                results. In local music scene, its very obvious --- best male 
                and female singer forever is not the most popular male and female 
                singer. The thing that can be said to really bring &quot;Faye&quot; 
                into the whole of Asia market is the following few mandarin pieces 
                : &quot;Chess&quot;, &quot;Sky&quot; , &quot;I'm Willing&quot;.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">&quot;Faye&quot; 
                finally at this time successfully positioned herself, theres lots 
                of female singers, old, new all naturally have a tough competition, 
                fake products suddenly all appeared in the market, all tried to 
                learn &quot;Faye&quot;.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Learn is learn. 
                What Faye had done before, if another person do it again will 
                definitely be said as &quot;Learn Faye'. Result : learn Faye most 
                likely will receive bad comments from the designers, learn Faye 
                to get married have kid , might not definitely can receive a red 
                carpet to welcome the whole family to come out together, learn 
                Faye to be black face to try to be in the entertainment news, 
                learn Faye singing, history has proven there's only a dead end.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">But, faye also 
                did learn from talents that only can she be better. Why all the 
                other female singers are being commented till so badly, but she 
                can be spared of this ? The main reason I believe is at that time 
                &quot;Faye&quot; is the first comer. Besides became very fast 
                to be the market leader. Looking at outside and inside, Faye might 
                not be walking very fast, but other people can be walking a bit 
                faster.</span></font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Want to make 
                the music lovers to continue support &quot;Faye Wong&quot;, besides 
                need to continue rely on good songs to treat the fans, appropriate 
                variations to attract and maintain her own supporters also have 
                a great effect.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">In order to 
                make her position different from the normal singers, &quot;Faye 
                Wong&quot; in her strategy, forsake the usual methods that singers 
                used to have a high apperance rate, promotions, talk nicely with 
                the media, change to use her own way and style of handling things, 
                with no fear attitude and daring style to fight with the media. 
                Although at the beginning, maybe someoe (believe is someone from 
                the record company) was worried about this, but this method of 
                handling in the end resulted in a miracle effect! Not only the 
                media is amazed, the general public also think that &quot;Faye 
                Wong&quot; is really someone with her own character, successfully 
                created the character building in the market.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">This point 
                for a product, is very very important, this is because if a product 
                does not have a character that is recognised, when competitors 
                appear, that product will be easily forgotten by its target customers, 
                thus competiveness will be lessened. This can be used to explain 
                why many female singers have failed.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">After changing 
                her record company, Faye announced that she will give up cantonese 
                songs as her main hit songs, as she wants to be more involved 
                in her own creations and forsake the past type of music style.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Present &quot;Faye 
                Wong&quot; has really done that, no fake request, in the market, 
                she can be seen as the most outstanding.</span></font></p>

                one or two years, &quot;Faye Wong&quot; in the local music market 
                is still in the leading position, other brands even if sell similarly 
                well, but the amount is still a distance from &quot;Faye Wong&quot;,

                appearance, to &quot;Faye &quot;, can be said is truly a competitor 
                for the past few years, because in many areas, both are quite 
                homogeneous products, both are using mandarin songs are their 
                main hits. Singing styles can be said both have their own outstanding 
                points. Normally in cases like people tend to like 'new things', 
                fans are lost, such things is unavoidable. Even though so, want 
                to replace &quot;Faye Wong&quot; market leader position, &quot;Ah-Mei&quot; 
                seems to still have a distance to walk. Thus, to be concerned 
                about Faye's latest release &quot;Sing &amp; Play&quot;, no matter 
                in the promotions or the production side, all have a very high 
                standard, beilev &quot;A-Mei&quot; still need to work harder.</span></font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">You buy &quot;Faye 
                Wong&quot;, have u ask yourself why ? Maybe you dun believe Faye 
                herself and the record company, or manager company can be so good, 
                but the above analysis can really be explained for the above. 
                The fact is &quot; Faye Wong&quot; success can be said is not 
                a purposely made result. Want to surpass the past whole list , 
                is not only lower down two keys can made it. Faye from the beginning 
                to now never under the table to fight for two more awards or two 
                more movies. It's also because of this type of let things happen 
                naturally that makes her became Big today , really makes the writer 
                very interested, so he wants to try to put this case to analysis 
                from a 'lazy' way of thinking.</span></font></p>

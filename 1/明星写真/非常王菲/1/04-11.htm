                This time, Faye is very outstanding as compared to what I saw 
                her at her last concert in Singapore a few years back. This time 
                is more exciting! Not only because of her wide range of outfits 
                and hairstyles that were added with more new ideas, and also not 
                because she sang over 30 plus songs that are all good songs of 
                different styles, its more not because of the large amount of 
                investments that is spend on the stage design. Most importantly, 
                what I saw was : Faye ....that has more open up herself, reveal 
                out her own character and is not far away form us. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Report :<br>
                January 9, 8pm, I rushed to the Hong Kong Stadium to catch the 
                last nite of 'Faye's Sing &amp; Play World Tour Hong Kong Concert'. 
                Heard that is the most cold nite since Christmas, but there were 
                lots of people, all with excited looks and with hands and legs 
                full with anticipation, filled the big stadium. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">It's already 
                the last day of the concert, but the one million and two thousand 
                seats were all fully taken up. Other than the times, when the 
                stars , like Kuang Ming Quan, Chen Yu Lian, Luo Jia Yin, Du Ke 
                Feng and others caught the attention of the media; rest of the 
                time, the whole stadium is waiting patiently to be with Faye for 
                their last date. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Starting off 
                with 3 songs of her own compositions, 'Love Life', ' Exasperation 
                Times' &amp; 'Bored'. After these 3 songs, Faye said to the audience 
                &quot; Tonite is the 17th nite of my concert since I sing from 
                Christmas, and also is the last nite, You are happy or not happy 
                ? happy ah ...? why happy ? ...haha.....I very happy wo ....because 
                from tonite onwards, I can finally take a good rest.&quot; </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">The continuous 
                17 nites, besides having to stay in a good composure, not only 
                sing, sing, sing, change, change, change ( 6 sets of outfits), 
                she also needs to wear the 'restricted no shoes, world's first 
                type' of high heel shoes to walk in the water, also walk on the 
                high and elevated stage areas, and sometimes unexpectedly, suddenly 
                appears off the stage. If really think about it, its really quite 
                tiring, especially for Faye, who is afraid of heights and sometimes 
                walk not too stable. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Compared to 
                the past, which was more simple, this time is obviously of a very 
                high standard. The circulating stage that goes round really helps 
                to bring the distance closer between faye and her audience. I 
                see a Faye, that is continously waving and shaking hands, face 
                filled with smiles and happy to receive good compliments from 
                the fans , like ' You are very beautiful.' </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Seems like 
                we can see, Faye has already removed 'the distance is beauty' 
                kind of thinking. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">In the concert, 
                theres many things that allows Faye's cute and fun loving character 
                to flow naturally, e.g : the goodluck hedgehog, cartoon animated 
                scenes, the pool next to the stage, her daily life shots that 
                is captured like a documentary, plus lots of live responses, move 
                with the beat and rhythm of the music, and legs swaying along, 
                all these reveals Faye's forwardness and childlike manners. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">As per normal, 
                Faye still talks quite little, in the whole 2&amp;1/2 hrs concert, 
                she only sings a sing after another, &quot;chess, cold war, an 
                yong, sky,face,lost road,dreamlover,sleepwalk, forgive myself,doomsday,degeneration,angel,nostalgia,dream 
                awaken,brink of love and pain, love commandments, one person two 
                roles, di-dar, exit, ai-mei, you happy I happy, dated, repayment, 
                I'm willing, Last forever and No regrets.&quot; </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Never tried 
                before seeing a concert can be so enjoyable, after 30 over songs, 
                Faye's standard never dropped at all, you really cannot be not 
                amazed by her ! Compared to the past, only standing on the stage 
                and swaying the long sleeves of hers, this time Faye's concerts 
                is all areas have added in lots of new concepts and ideas, but 
                all these selling points did not waver our attention. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">We all saw....except 
                Faye, still is Faye, is only Faye.</span></font></p>

              <p>CANTO-POP PRINCESS FAYE WONG BROADENS HER APPEAL WITH A QUIRKIER 
                SOUND</p>
              <p><em>- ANTHONY SPAETH </em></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Asian divas 
                are digital-era Galateas, molded, tutored and hyped by their record 
                companies in hopes that the public will fall in love. Faye Wong 
                was just such a creation. Spotted at the age of 20 by a Hong Kong 
                record company, the Beijing-born Wong was groomed for stardom, 
                poured into perky dresses and supplied with standard ballads in 
                the Hong Kong genre known as Canto-Pop. The efforts worked: Wong's 
                first three CDs climbed the charts, and like many a pretty songbird 
                before her, she was besieged with concert and television offers. 
                </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">But Wong decided 
                she didn't fit on that polymer plinth. Today she writes her own 
                songs, performs them in an increasingly personal style--in Cantonese 
                for the Hong Kong audience, in Mandarin for her larger following 
                on the mainland and Taiwan--and has spurned the high-profile existence 
                once thought indispensable to keeping a Chinese pop star in public 
                favour. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">She ignores 
                the press and seeks inspiration in such iconoclastic performers 
                as Ireland's Sinead O' Connor. Amazingly, the public likes her 
                better than ever. Her 16 records have sold an estimated 7 million 
                copies, and in 1995 a trade association proclaimed Wong the most 
                popular female singer in the Chinese-speaking world. In 1994 she 
                starred in Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai's avant-garde film 
                Chungking Express, for which she won a best-actress award in Sweden. 
                &quot;Faye does whatever she wants,&quot; says her manager, Katie 
                Chan. &quot;It's really quite a miracle that she became a success.&quot; 
                </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">A handful of 
                male singers, the &quot;Four Pop Kings&quot;--Jacky Cheung, Aaron 
                Kwok, Andy Lau and Leon Lai--dominate Hong Kong's recording industry. 
                Wong, 27, is one of the first women to gain anything like that 
                kind of clout, and she has done so uniquely, through undeniable 
                talent and a near complete rejection of all that is expected of 
                a Chinese pop diva. Her latest CD, Restless, has five songs without 
                lyrics: Wong hummed and scatted her way through them. Sally Yeh, 
                one of Hong Kong's most successful musical stars, describes Wong 
                as &quot;an incredible singer who makes art rather than entertainment.&quot; 
                Local radio deejay Angel Leung likens her to the protean David 
                Bowie: &quot;She has talent, personality, good looks and the courage 
                to do what she wants. Her unusual achievements greatly improve 
                the profile and standing of Hong Kong artists.&quot; </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Wong's father 
                was a mining engineer, while her mother sang in a Chinese revolutionary-music 
                troupe. Faye was an outgoing youngster who loved sports imagined 
                she would follow in her mother's footsteps. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">&quot;My dreams 
                varied,&quot; says Wong at a Beijing coffee shop during a recording 
                break. Tall (1.72 m), lean and appealingly boyish, she sports 
                her favored offstage look--jeans, T shirt and no makeup. &quot;At 
                one point I wanted to be a bus- ticket vendor because I fancied 
                the uniform.&quot; </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">In 1987 her 
                family migrated to Hong Kong, and Wong, out of boredom and loneliness, 
                started lessons with a well-known singing teacher. &quot;As a 
                mainland Chinese,&quot; she recalls, &quot;I harbored the usual 
                expectation of Hong Kong as a glamorous and exciting place. After 
                I arrived, I found it to be no big deal. I wasn't very happy because 
                I couldn't speak Cantonese and had no friends.&quot; After two 
                years of lessons, Wong's teacher introduced her to Cinepoly Records, 
                a subsidiary of one of the world's biggest record companies, London-based 
                Polygram, and the execs decided to make the investment necessary 
                to synthesize a new pop star. They gave her a stage name, Shirley 
                Wong, and a parcel of songs. Her first CD, Shirley Wong, was released 
                in November 1989, and two more followed over the next 12 months. 
                All three were big sellers. <br>
                <br>
                Then Wong took a fateful step. She put her stardom on hold to 
                go to New York City for several months. Although she intended 
                to study music there, the real goal of the pilgrimage abroad was 
                to learn something about herself. &quot;I wandered around, visited 
                museums and sat at cafes,&quot; she recalls.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">&quot;There 
                were so many strange, confident-looking people. They didn't care 
                what other people thought of them. I felt I was originally like 
                that too, independent and a little rebellious. But in Hong Kong 
                I lost myself. I was shaped by others and became like a machine, 
                a dress hanger. I had no personality and no sense of direction.&quot; 
                </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">She decided 
                to return to Hong Kong show biz, but on her own terms. Her next 
                CD, Coming Home, included The Woman Who Easily Gets Hurt, which 
                won several awards and confirmed Wong as an evocative singer who 
                could master a wide musical range. The CD's popularity made her 
                a superstar. Soon Wong changed her first name back to Faye. For 
                concerts Wong demanded unheard-of controls: she chose the song 
                lineup, orchestration and stage and costume design. She immediately 
                abandoned the traditional glitz and frippery for a style more 
                chanteuse than bubble gum. &quot;I designed long sleeves because 
                I want to hide my hands,&quot; she explains. &quot;I don't have 
                any choreography to go with my music, so I usually don't know 
                what to do with my hands.&quot;Not that anyone notices. &quot;She 
                can mesmerize an audience of more than 8,000,&quot; says concert 
                promoter Kevin Ching, &quot;without the fancy trappings, without 
                being backed by dozens of dancers and tons of props. Very few 
                artists can afford to do this.&quot;</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp; The 
                public adulation that energizes so many performers means little 
                to Wong. &quot;In a studio I can concentrate on perfecting the 
                way I sing a song,&quot; she says. &quot;Onstage one has to worry 
                about atmosphere and audience response. I find it distracting.&quot; 
                During a 1994 concert tour, she traded insults with hecklers, 
                grew impatient with fans nagging her and told them they were &quot;nuts.&quot; 
                Few seemed to mind the rebuke from their idol. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Her new sound 
                is polished, as in ordinary Canto-Pop, and her voice is familiarly 
                soft and fluid. But a defiant edge is increasingly noticeable 
                in both Wong's tough lyrics and her more stark enunciations. She 
                has recently collaborated with the ethereal Scottish trio Cocteau 
                Twins; she contributed to one of the songs on their latest CD, 
                Milk 'n Kisses, released this year, and the Scots composed two 
                songs for her Restless, which appeared in June. Also helping out 
                on Restless was mainland pop star Dou Wei, Wong's current boyfriend. 
                Hong Kong fans are eager for news about the couple, but Wong guards 
                her private life zealously. She lives with her parents in Hong 
                Kong's fashionable Mid-Levels district. Instead of partying, she 
                would rather stay home and read a book (on philosophy or Tai Chi) 
                or play mah-jongg and snooker. The press likes to portray her 
                as the bad girl of Hong Kong's music scene, but she says a better 
                description comes from her new album: she's just...restless. &quot;Being 
                restless is almost a universal human condition,&quot; says Wong. 
                &quot;You agitate to reach a certain kind of status quo. Once 
                you achieve that, you agitate to change again. It's a never-ending 
                process.&quot; </span></font></p>

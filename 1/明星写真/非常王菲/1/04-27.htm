              <p> <font face="宋体"
    size="3"></font><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">There was 
                something feminine about Elvis. His mouth formed the pout of a 
                sullen schoolgirl; his hair was swathed in more chemicals than 
                a starlet's; his hips churned like a hooker's in heat. Presley 
                was manly too, in a street-punk way. For him, the electric guitar 
                was less an instrument than a symbolic weapon--an ax or a machine 
                gun aimed at the complacent pop culture of the '50s. Performing 
                his pansexual rite to a heavy bass line, Elvis set the primal 
                image for rock: a man and his guitar, the tortured satyr and his 
                magic lute. He also established the androgyny of the male star. 
                When a guy could provide his own sexual menace, long hair, coquetry 
                and falsetto singing, who needed women? Oh, they were allowed 
                to scream in the audience, or maybe sing backup, but not to rock 
                on, down and dirty, with the big bad boys. Even today girls are 
                no more encouraged to pick up a Stratocaster than to pilot an 
                F-16. They are expected to play only one instrument: the voice. 
                </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">And do they! 
                After nearly 40 years as second-class citizens, women singers 
                are staging their own revolution, The upheaval may be demure, 
                even ladylike; Miwa Yoshida does not froth on the concert stage, 
                nor is Faye Wong likely to trash a hotel room. But they have stormed 
                the barricades where it counts: on the charts of best-selling 
                CDs and in the hearts of a billion or so fans around the world. 
                They have reconfigured pop music. This is the era of the pop diva. 
                </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Diva means 
                goddess. The dictionary definition is more modern: &quot;an operatic 
                prima donna.&quot; Let's fiddle a little with those words. &quot;Operatic&quot;: 
                note the strenuous, hyperemotional, aria-like feel to many pop 
                ballads. &quot;Prima donna&quot;: remove its suggestion of imperious 
                temperament and translate it literally as &quot;first lady.&quot; 
                Voila! Celine Dion or Gloria Estefan, Whitney or Mariah, Madonna 
                or Enya, Miwa or Faye, Toni Braxton or Tina Arena, Annie Lennox 
                or Alanis Morissette. They come from the U.S., of course, but 
                also from French and English Canada, from Cuba, Ireland, Scotland, 
                France, Germany, Australia, Japan and China. In every country, 
                in any language: la diva. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Like so many 
                other forms of popular culture, the diva genre exists both locally 
                and globally at the same time. Dion, from French Canada, alternates 
                albums in French and English. Estefan, born in Cuba and raised 
                in Miami, records in Spanish and English. Dion was chosen to open 
                the Olympic Games in Atlanta with a pop hymn, The Power of the 
                Dream, backed by a 300-member gospel choir, and Estefan was there 
                on closing night to sing her anthemic Reach. Both singers embodied 
                success stories as potent as any come-from-behind Olympic fairy 
                tale: Dion, the youngest of 14 children who has become this year's 
                Diva Deluxe; and Estefan, brave survivor of a 1990 bus crash that 
                broke her back, who is now back on top. &quot;So I'll go the distance 
                this time,&quot; she intones, &quot;seeing more the higher I climb.&quot; 
                </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Divas can't 
                climb much higher. They nestle at or near the top of their country's 
                music charts. Some, like Dion, Houston and Mariah Carey--not to 
                mention, for the moment, Canada's crack-voiced outlaw diva Alanis 
                Morissette--have been on the Top 10 lists in Europe, the Americas 
                and the Pacific Rim simultaneously. More important, most are damn 
                fine singers. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">They are a 
                link between the great voices of the past (think of Ella Fitzgerald, 
                Ethel Merman, Edith Piaf) and the ears of people who can't get 
                attuned to the howling self-pity of much contemporary rock but 
                aren't ready to give up on pop music. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Like the Olympic 
                spirit, the divas' internationalist impulse reflects both a curiosity 
                about other cultures and a nose for smart marketing. To spur Japanese 
                sales of her Colour of My Love album, Dion added a new song, To 
                Love You More, from the Japanese TV mini-series Lover, backed 
                instrumentally by the Japanese ensemble Kryzler &amp; Kompany. 
                Dion sang it in English, but the locals didn't mind: they bought 
                1.5 million copies. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">A diva needn't 
                be Western to have the international flair. Nothing forces Yoshida, 
                the soul-jazz sensation who fronts the band Dreams Come True, 
                to go west to increase her Japanese fan base. She still writes 
                and performs songs in her native language. Yet she usually records 
                in Britain, and she cut her first solo set, Beauty and Harmony, 
                in New York City with some top American sidemen. The collaboration 
                produced vocals that were more precise, more regimented, than 
                her past work. But it showed the need for even top regional artists 
                to prove their chops in the U.S., which is still revered as the 
                big leagues for singers. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Some stars 
                of the Pacific, like Tina Arena, have long set their sights on 
                America. An Australian who has sung publicly since she was five, 
                Arena has an easy authority as vocalist and songwriter; her cool-teen 
                voice matches her rock-easy compositions, which are so infectious 
                that six-year-olds would learn them instantly and so familiar 
                that you might think they were big hits a decade ago (they're 
                all new, all hers). When Arena gets precision and voltage into 
                the songs--Heaven Help My Heart, Greatest Gift, Standing Up--she 
                sounds like a kid sister to Elaine Paige, superb star of London 
                musicals, who introduced such instant standards as Don't Cry for 
                Me Argentina (from Evita), Memory (from Cats) and a quite different 
                Heaven Help My Heart (from Chess). But England is not Arena's 
                destination. She's moved to Los Angeles because, like a lot of 
                divas, she may believe she can't be a star until she's an American 
                star. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Wong is too 
                cool to entertain those ambitions. Indeed, she prefers to record 
                in her native Beijing, where she can concentrate on her music, 
                rather than in Hong Kong, where for years she was a formulaic 
                Canto-pop singer known as Shirley Wong. Her striking, angular 
                looks--think of an elongated pixie who moonlights as a sorceress--made 
                her a natural for movies, but her debut made few notice; in Beyond's 
                Diary she played the girlfriend of a pop musician. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Gradually she 
                found her own style, on records and on film. Her second picture, 
                Wong Kar-wai's Chungking Express, made her a hip pinup to sophisticated 
                moviegoers on both sides of the Pacific. The film also internationalized 
                her choice of music. She plays a dizzy waitress in a fast-food 
                restaurant who is obsessed with going to California and playing, 
                over and over and over, the 1966 California Dreamin' by the Mamas 
                and the Papas. Over the end credits she sings a Cantonese cover 
                of the Cranberries hit Dreams. And now, on her Restless CD, she 
                meets the international market on her own terms: five of the songs 
                have no intelligible lyrics at all, and two irresistibly obscurantist 
                cuts were written and produced by Scotland's Cocteau Twins. Wong 
                remains the spooky gamin of Chinese music, and Restless is a wondrous 
                blend of Canto-pop and lollipop. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Wong's approach 
                alternates between a blissed-out whisper and bright piping in 
                a register so high only Pekingese pups can hear it. That puts 
                her squarely in one tradition of divadom: the vocal virtuoso. 
                For decades, two Americans defined this style. Patti LaBelle, 
                a gospel-trained ranter, has enthralled the faithful with her 
                mad-woman riffs. Bette Midler, known internationally as the blowsy 
                star of movie comedies, built her career as a throwback singer 
                who could evoke Sophie Tucker's bawdiness and Bessie Smith's soul-in-hell 
                emotional exhaustion with equal power and facility. The virtuoso 
                mode can also be heard in the florid, world-weary style of France's 
                Catherine Ribeiro and, with glances back to the glamour of Piaf 
                and Dietrich, in the bitter brilliance of Germany's Ute Lemper. 
                Though their styles were unique, all these women kept bright the 
                flame of the traditional torch singer. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">But none of 
                them became international superstars or encouraged others to do 
                the same. For that you can thank Houston (and her mentor at Arista 
                Records, Clive Davis). It was an old recipe--great chops, exotic 
                looks and a clever choice of material--that served Lena Horne, 
                Abbey Lincoln, Eartha Kitt, and Houston's cousin Dionne Warwick. 
                But in the harsh prevailing winds of mid-'80s rap and heavy metal, 
                Houston was a welcome spring breeze. Her delicacy of phrasing 
                made songs like Saving All My Love for You and The Greatest Love 
                of All easy listening in the best sense. Her prom-queen glamour 
                made her an ideal star for the early video era, an antidote to 
                Cyndi Lauper's goofy-girl atavism and Madonna's bad-girl sass. 
                Her first album, Whitney Houston, sold 10 million copies. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Houston has 
                retained her eminence, if not pre-eminence, while curtailing her 
                output: she has released less than a single regular album's worth 
                of songs, only 10, since 1990. But her example and her relative 
                quiescence have spurred a dozen divas-in-waiting. Many noted the 
                structure of Houston's big hits--a slow-tempo devotional tune 
                that escalates from the foreplay of whispers to the explosive 
                orgasm of wails and whoops--and made the mistake of imitating 
                it. (Houston made that error too.) Dion's early English-language 
                albums are almost touching in their fidelity to the Whitney formula. 
                It took her a while to realize she could relax on record. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Today's top 
                Whitneyesque star is Mariah Carey. Like Houston, she'll mix ballads 
                with synthesized dance music; she's a handsome woman with a video 
                flair; she has a patron in Tommy Mottola, boss of her record company, 
                who is also her husband. Carey has even outsold Houston in the 
                '90s, because she releases albums at a busier pace. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">One big difference: 
                Houston sings straight soprano with some church inflection; Carey 
                is a coloratura. She could even be called a cubist, for she appraises 
                nearly every note in every song from a dozen or more angles. In 
                When I Saw You from her current Daydream CD, Carey breaks the 
                word knew into an amazing 26 separate notes (this is only an estimate: 
                we played these four seconds over and over, and got up to 26 just 
                before we went mad). Her jazzy riffs suggest demon virtuosity, 
                but it could also be musical browsing. Maybe Carey can't decide 
                which interpretation is the right one, so she tries them all. 
                </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Like Carey, 
                many female singers co-write their music. Many others don't, and 
                are thus handicapped by pop's 30-year tyranny of singer-songwriters. 
                Hey, if you don't write, you're not an artist. &quot;Vocal interpreter&quot; 
                used to be an honorable job description--good enough for Ella, 
                Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole. Now the epithet 
                is often an insult. It conjures up images of a Las Vegas lounge 
                singer crooning Feelings. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">All right, 
                maybe the top pop songwriters of the day--Babyface and David Foster 
                (who collaborated on Dion's The Power of the Dream) and Diane 
                Warren (who helped Estefan write Reach) aren't Gershwin and Stephen 
                Foster and Harry Warren. But they can write good songs for good 
                singers. These three composers all had a hand in Toni Braxton's 
                fine Secrets CD--dusky, mellow, infectiously commercial, like 
                a grownup Tina Arena. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">And there's 
                plenty of other good music to record. Alison Krauss, a child fiddle 
                prodigy from Illinois and later a world-class bluegrass singer 
                with her band Union Station, became a star with her 1995 compilation 
                Now That I've Found You. The set puts Krauss's mountain-stream 
                soprano on pretty display. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">She caresses 
                standards from R. and B. (the title song), gospel (the soul-lifting 
                When God Dips His Pen of Love in My Heart) and the Paul McCartney 
                catalog (an elfin I Will). Think of it: a singer with no gimmick 
                but a passionate talent and a great, rangy taste in music. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">If there's 
                a knock on the modern divas--whether pop, like Carey, Houston 
                and Dion, or pure, like Krauss--it's that their material is just 
                too amiable. Much of their music is not just middle of the road; 
                it tiptoes on the white line in the middle of the middle of the 
                road. Dammit, they sing like girls! And in social norms, the pop 
                diva adheres to the proper side of the gender split in music. 
                She is expected to be a sister before a lover; the operative slur 
                word is &quot;nice.&quot; Pop is the boarding school where the 
                good girls live. Rock is the shooting gallery where the naughty 
                boys hang out. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Somewhere between 
                these extremes there should be an outlaw diva. She can do cool-guy 
                things: write songs about malaise and disorientation, play a harmonica, 
                take herself very seriously, sell 16 million copies of her first 
                big CD. Why, she could be Alanis Morissette--the anti-Whitney, 
                the pariah Mariah, the outre Faye, the mean Celine. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Anyway, that's 
                how the 22-year-old comes across on a first listen of the Jagged 
                Little Pill album. Morissette's songs sound aggressive, grudging, 
                desperate. Her alto lurches among the octaves, from growl to shriek. 
                A typical phrase will end in a gasp, as if one of the emotional 
                inferiors in her songs had suddenly retaliated by pressing thumb 
                and forefinger on her windpipe. The voice of Sinead O'Connor, 
                you imagine, in the mind of Patti Smith. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">But Morissette 
                is not that simple. A former teen star in her native Canada, she's 
                smart enough to give her choruses sing-along melodies--the likely 
                contribution of co-writer Glen Ballard, who formerly produced 
                Wilson Phillips, the trio of cool-harmonizing, second-generation 
                pop stars. In the perkier tunes (You Learn, Head over Feet), the 
                singer overdubs tight harmonies that might have come from Wilson 
                Phillips. And that is Morissette's dirty little secret: inside 
                her edgy plaints are craft and a yen to please. She's a mainstream 
                diva in spite of herself. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Morissette 
                may soon discover that the rock machismo she approximates is often 
                just an acid flavor of the month: a hit, a burnout, a trivia question. 
                But being a diva is a life's work. The Scottish Annie Lennox has 
                been at it for 20 years, developing a husky voice and a gift for 
                weaving a dramatic spell that is almost visual. Her 1995 Medusa 
                album has 10 old and new songs written by others. The opening 
                cut, No More &quot;I Love You's,&quot; relies on Lennox's evocation 
                of love's demons--&quot;Desire, despair, desire, so many monsters&quot;--and 
                her conjuring up, in a mid-song monologue, of a little girl for 
                whom these monsters come to life. A woman's bed of sad passion 
                has telescoped into a child's bedroom fears at midnight. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">The final number 
                on Medusa is Paul Simon's 1973 Something So Right. In Lennox's 
                gorgeous reworking, she answers the pessimism of No More &quot;I 
                Love You's&quot; and completes the album's circle. &quot;Some 
                people never say the words I love you, / But like a child I'm 
                longing to be told.&quot; Again a girl in a woman's supple voice, 
                Lennox finds salvation foraging in a child's garden of cries from 
                the heart. Lennox might be Piaf here--there's that eerie understanding 
                of a lyric--but with the fever adjusted to room temperature. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Piaf is still 
                an icon, both for her poignant life story and for her ability 
                to hurdle emotion over the language barrier. But in the world 
                market of the '90s, when virtually every album with gigantic global 
                sales is in some form of English, what's a diva to do? Cultivate 
                her own garden, for the worldwide boom in CD sales means there 
                are more people searching for something different. Morissette's 
                album is bubble-gum music next to Tori Amos' Boys for Pele, with 
                its forbiddingly opaque lyrics, a voice that runs amuck over the 
                octaves and the famous inside photo of Amos with a suckling piglet 
                at her breast. Yet the album has sold millions. Moral: You can't 
                be too weird. You must be you. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">That is the 
                message attended to by Wong in her recent take-me-or-leave-me 
                mode, and by Yoshida in her American experiment. It surely applies 
                to singers who harbor nations within themselves. Enya, the Celtic 
                lass whose ethereal soundscapes might have emanated from a very 
                gentle UFO, sings in Gaelic, English and Latin--the languages 
                of family, school and church. Her melodies are so mellow as to 
                seem downright shy, yet they're so popular that an entire genre 
                of new music is known simply as Enya. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">By that standard, 
                the pop brand of Cuban-American music should probably be called 
                Gloria. With time, the Estefan sound has grown full and wise, 
                Latin rhythms accompanying rather than defining the melody. Estefan 
                has also learned to write for her voice and disposition; on her 
                latest album, Destiny, she has taken her own advice. Reach--higher. 
                </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">And Celine 
                Dion has reached inside. The Falling into You CD, a supercharged 
                superproduction, will yield perhaps half a dozen smasheroo singles, 
                and it's a treat to hear her belt a song to bits. But a bigger 
                piece of her heart can be found on The French Album. There the 
                girl from Quebec sings in her mother's language and in a voice 
                so ardent and discreet it reminds you of Elvis in the intimate 
                ballads he recorded in his time off from creating the bad-boy 
                iconography of rock. Murmuring like the heart just before sleeping, 
                Dion's voice summons the power and the glory of the diva. </span></font></p>

                &quot;City Magazine&quot; have Faye. Its been about one billion, 
                two thousand, six hundered and fourteen million and four thousand 
                seconds apart, since Faye last appeared on &quot;City Magazine&quot; 
                cover in 1994 Dec, its also about when she was doing her concert 
                time then.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">In all, I know 
                two of her. One is the friendly, just like all the other Artists, 
                Wong Jing Wen , with an english name called Shirley, another is 
                Detach far away from the crowd, media , and has a strong character 
                of her own, Faye Wong.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">No matter which 
                times Faye you or me like, cannot deny that the Faye now , her 
                name is already a &quot;fairy tale&quot;, one who breaks through 
                the entertainment game rules, but who still can keep her super 
                position.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">I do not intend 
                to discuss (analysis) faye's current times, no matter how the 
                media describes her attitude, her family situation, her rumours 
                and moods, those who like her only will love her even more of 
                her doing her way kind of handling method. Her albums are still 
                the pop charts Best-Seller, her every performance is defintely 
                worth the price, her Position still remains as the Asian Pop Queen 
                ..... I feel, this should be one criteria in the heart that reflects 
                a normal person cannot or do not dare to do things, Faye has the 
                capability to do it very cooly and nicely with no regrets. A truly 
                worthwhile idol mainly needs this kind of not give in easily to 
                challenges kind of brave attitude.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Artiste must 
                definitely have Charisma, this is the first criteria on the list. 
                Faye's Charisma has two types : includes appearance and feeling. 
                Faye's appearance originally is very beautiful, with a pair of 
                big eyes and sharp face, plus a heavenly good and clear voice. 
                I read some articles before regarding Faye, when she first began 
                as a model, but if she dun sing, then it will have been such a 
                waste in her talent.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">With Faye's 
                height, her character as a singer, isn't it what a true version 
                of a Model ?</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">I have always 
                love to see faye Mtvs, because every time I can feel that the 
                Creative Team's production efforts, from the director to the scenes 
                to image to her performance, you will be able to feel that kind 
                of effort that they have put in. Till to date, the mtvs I like 
                most are &quot;I'm Willing&quot;, &quot;Chess&quot; and &quot; 
                I dun wish to be this either&quot;.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Besides, liking 
                the Cool Cool faye, also like her excellent choice of dressing, 
                a very expensive shirt wore on her will not give the fake impression 
                of the richness , this is really a heavenly gift that we cannot 
                envy about.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">I have seen 
                many Faye's live performances, personally experience that kind 
                of with the live audience and fans, that kind of natural and not 
                fake good responses. Every moment and smile of faye will make 
                the audience to scream loudly and led to great amount of applause 
                and cheering .......</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">The most recent 
                deep impression I had was at the end of September , under FM 104 
                &quot; Good Friends Concert&quot;, together with Faye performing 
                was her good friend, Naying and Jeff Chang. That night Faye was 
                High High, heard it was due to she drank a little wine before 
                that. I feel that that night , faye's performance was specially 
                relax , specially happy, because she sang all her favourite songs, 
                have her own songs, also have other people's songs, and songs 
                she co-operate with her two good friends.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Actually this 
                is not too hard to understand, one normal person find one job 
                that she likes, will also be very enthusiastic about it. Thus, 
                since she came back from America , she formally changed back to 
                her Faye Wong status to face the audience, music style also change 
                to all starts from herself, Faye sings with even more feelings 
                and also gets herself involved in the compositions work and gets 
                her local musicians and their works. No doubt most of her more 
                popular songs have some commercial factors in them, but we cannot 
                deny that she indeed have lead the Hong Kong music lovers to have 
                more contact and wider exposure with more alternative music and 
                another listening sky.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Some people 
                say Faye is a happy woman. According to old sayings as a measurement, 
                one who is married, have a child, this woman is a happy family 
                life model. But Faye is not one who suits that kind of life, and 
                live as a rich lady and people serving her, just this physic this 
                round, she is even more fit now than before she gave birth to 
                Tong Tong, especially is her two skiny shoulders and her 24 inches 
                waist. I think many young mothers also wish to learn from her 
                how she keep fit.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Heavenly born 
                couple, Douwei and Faye, never shown their happiness and sweetness 
                in front of people, but the kind of chemistry can be clearly shown 
                in their music. I always dun envy those kind of loving couples, 
                kissing and holding hands now and then, this kind of gauge is 
                too shallow. That old song &quot; Exit&quot; , isn't it the best 
                thing to varify their love ?</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Its almost 
                been four years. Faye is going to have her second solo concert. 
                From her experience in this line and her popularity rate to calculate, 
                she cannot be considered as one who makes a lot of money as a 
                singer. If not, she can have a concert every year and her income 
                will be large enough to buy many rich houses in Hong Kong already.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">I'm beginning 
                to wait for that one billion, two thousand, six hundered and fourteen 
                million and four thousand seconds later , going to happen soon 
                event ......1998 December Christmas belongs to Faye Wong. What 
                will you expect in one Sing &amp; Play Big World ?</span></font></p>

                words Text : Zhao An</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">I never say 
                I have an idol, Faye is one of them.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Like a person, 
                like a thing, can have no reason, just that feeling, like is like, 
                dun like is dun like, no need any explanations. Some people just 
                have that kind of attraction that will make to like them naturally, 
                Faye is that kind of people.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">I met Faye 
                once. That was during one weekend, in evening, in Zhong Huan Galleria's 
                Joyce saw Faye. She was shopping happily, no one dares to go up 
                to disturb her. When leaving, I met her again at the Escalator, 
                that time Jean Paul Gaultier was still there. It was there Faye 
                left a signature for me, when she was leaving, she said Bye Bye, 
                her attitude was very friendly.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Many friends 
                around me like Faye too, say Faye dun need any words to describe, 
                everything about her is all totally in her music, her music is 
                the best bridge to communicate between her and her fans. Any time 
                you pick any one of her Cds, listen carefully to every note, every 
                word, plus that light, soft, clear voice, seems you can understand 
                her a bit more. Faye's voice, even if is simply &quot;la la ....oh 
                oh ....&quot; is already very attractive, is even touching and 
                better than those songs with lyrics, no wonder people say woman 
                have a soft, nice voice is a gift from Heaven.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">You say Faye 
                beautiful or not ? I say no. Some people have all the 5 parts 
                of the face very very beautiful, but lack a kind of sophistication; 
                Faye do not have a perfect 5 parts, but when all is put together 
                brings out a kind of very easy feeling to people, especially is 
                her pair of talking eyes. People says this type of eyes is best 
                for acting, but Faye didn't choose this road, till to date her 
                only work is &quot;ChungKing Express.&quot; Besides, the story 
                is attractive, is that Faye's Pure, very natural way of acting 
                attracts people. Though there's some who criticize on her acting, 
                but I like and thats it. Good things sometimes is just like that, 
                comes naturally. If purposely go and do something, the results 
                might not be as good as expected. Everything is the same, goes 
                with the feelings!</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Faye's life 
                has long been exposed, by coincidence, her career is a singer, 
                everyone can only see her in the screen. All those want to know 
                stuff, have all been written on those newspaper reports and articles 
                .....all have been reported, those kind of shopping and buying 
                houses stuff , leave to them to write lah! I'm still more concerned 
                about Faye's music.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Faye, still 
                is one who have a good voice and a normal woman.</span></font></p>

                , but she still help &quot;City Magazine&quot; to do the interview 
                below :</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">City : Music, 
                what is it to you ? Faye : Music, to me is part of my life, just 
                like my daily life, is also part of life, like a learning bridge, 
                is everything I learn.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">City : Towards 
                your singing career, do you have any ambitions or dreams ? Faye 
                : I never treat singing as my career, never thought of handling 
                it, singing is my interest, on the surface now, it seems like 
                my job, but I try not to think in this way, still treat it as 
                my interest. In this way, will be more simple and happy.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">City : Be popular, 
                albums sell well or not, is that important ? Faye : Cannot say 
                is not important, but is not the most important. I feel do one 
                thing that you like and receive others agreement and compliments 
                is a very happy thing. I will do things that I have interest in, 
                feel that I can do it, and can do it well things. I will take 
                note of others liking of me,but this is not what I wanted most.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">City : As for 
                backstage work, you did your own compositions before, write lyrics, 
                background vocals, next step what position will you try ? Will 
                try to learn any instruments ? Faye : Actually I dun know what 
                position or sort, now I do what I am able to do , and try to do 
                things that interest me, can do it or not is another thing. I 
                hope I can complete one full album by myself, but for now is still 
                a dream. I hope it can come true, but don't know when. Learn instruments 
                ? Very long ago, I did thought of that, but I do not wish to force 
                myself because of learn so go and learn, let nature take its own 
                course.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">City : Under 
                not liking to do promotions but still need to do, will you feel 
                is a kind of give in ? Faye : Sometimes give in is necessary, 
                no one can forever in one life do everything that he or she likes 
                to do, life, in this kind of dilemma, give in is necessary.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">City : Will 
                you suddenly disappear from the entertainment scene, live a simple 
                normal life ? Faye : I dun know, not possible to plan. But I feel 
                disappear from the entertainment scene and living a simple normal 
                life is two matters. Not much clashes, most important is in one's 
                heart, even though you are in the entertainment scene, you can 
                also lead a normal simple life.</span></font></p>

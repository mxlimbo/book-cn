            <p> FRANCESCA (cont'd)<br>
              (softly)<br>
              Don't you see, I've got to know the <br>
              truth, Robert. I've got to know the <br>
              truth or I'll go crazy. Either way. <br>
              Just tell me. But I can't act like <br>
              this is enough because it has to be. <br>
              I can't pretend I don't feel what I <br>
              feel because it's over tomorrow.</p>
            <p> Robert, keeping his face from her, tries to tell her:</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              If I've done anything to make you <br>
              think that what's happened between us <br>
              is nothing new for me -- is some <br>
              routine -- then I do apologize.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              What makes it different, Robert?</p>
            <p> Robert turns to face her. He is so hopelessly in love he can <br>
              hardly find the words. His eyes fill up with tears.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              Because... if I even think about <br>
              tomorrow -- if I...<br>
              (voice cracks)<br>
              even think about leaving here without <br>
              you -- I'm not sure I can... that I -<br>
              (he shakes his head)</p>
            <p> He can't even finish. He kneels down before her wrapping his <br>
              arms around her and burying his face into her body. Francesca <br>
              starts to cry -- out of happiness, out of pain -- holding onto <br>
              him as if for dear life.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              Oh God... what are we going to do?</p>
            <p> She kisses him -- over and over, not wanting to be even an <br>
              inch apart. As if any space between them might separate them <br>
              forever.</p>
            <p> Suddenly, OS, they hear a CAR DRIVE UP to the house. They <br>
              panic. Francesca runs to the window to see:</p>
            <p> MADGE, a girlfriend, has come for a visit. Madge is holding <br>
              a homemade dessert.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA (cont'd)<br>
              No. No. Where's your truck?</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              Behind the barn. I better go.</p>
            <p> Francesca turns to him -- speechless -- not wanting him to go.</p>
            <p> ROBERT (cont'd)<br>
              Don't worry. I meant upstairs.</p>
            <p> He exits. Francesca gathers herself and heads for the front <br>
              entrance, quickly cleaning up the plates.</p>
            <p> INT. FRONT HALL - DAY</p>
            <p> Francesca opens the door to Madge.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              Madge?</p>
            <p> MADGE<br>
              Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent <br>
              Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -<br>
              (entering)<br>
              &quot;Floyd, I'm going to visit my <br>
              girlfriend and spend the afternoon <br>
              and that's all there is to it. He <br>
              said who's going to make lunch? I <br>
              said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at <br>
              the dinner.&quot; Isn't that hilarious?<br>
              (MOVES INTO KITCHEN)<br>
              He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I <br>
              don't even want to tell you how late <br>
              he was out last night with those good <br>
              for nothings from the Sandford ranch. <br>
              I am so sorry, honey, I let two days <br>
              pass before I came by, but with the <br>
              boy home the time just escapes me. <br>
              Have you heard from Richard? How's <br>
              the fair? God, it's hot.</p>
            <p> Following her into the kitchen, Francesca doesn't know which <br>
              question to answer first.</p>
            <p> EXT. PORCH - LATER THAT DAY</p>
            <p> Madge and Francesca sit facing the pasture beside a table <br>
              with coffee and brown betty. We parachute into the middle of <br>
              the scene.</p>
            <p> MADGE<br>
              ... I said to her, &quot;what's the point <br>
              of summer school if all he's going to <br>
              do are these art projects. The boy <br>
              needs so much work in math and his <br>
              spelling is a nightmare...<br>
              (continues)</p>
            <p> Francesca isn't listening. Her mind wanders.</p>
            <p> FANTASY:</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              Madge. Please. Something's happened. <br>
              I've met someone. I've fallen in love <br>
              in a way I've never thought could <br>
              happen my entire life. It's our last <br>
              day together. I feel like I'm going to <br>
              die when he leaves. Please. Help me.</p>
            <p> MADGE<br>
              Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've <br>
              got to be grateful for even feeling <br>
              the little you've be given. Believe <br>
              me. Go to him. Don't let him leave <br>
              without these new precious hours <br>
              you've got left. And if you need <br>
              anyone to cry on, you know where I am.</p>
            <p> END OF FANTASY:</p>
            <p> Madge shoves a plate at her.</p>
            <p> MADGE (cont'd)<br>
              More brown betty?</p>
            <p> Francesca takes the plate. She can't think straight.</p>
            <p> MADGE (cont'd)<br>
              ... Anyway, I'm glad that's over <br>
              with. Sara doing so well though. <br>
              Everyone thought I was crazy having <br>
              them so far apart, but...<br>
              (CONTINUES...)</p>
            <p> FANTASY:</p>
            <p> Francesca stands behind Madge, as the latter chatters on MOS. 
              <br>
              She calmly picks up the brown betty and, from behind, shoves <br>
              it into Madge's face and holds it there, trying to suffocate <br>
              her with it. Madge struggles.</p>
            <p> END OF FANTASY:</p>
            <p> Francesca's mind races as Madge continues.</p>
            <p> MADGE<br>
              ... without one lesson. The <br>
              instructor couldn't believe it. So, <br>
              who knows -- she may have talent. <br>
              How's Carolyn doing? What are her <br>
              plans for next year?</p>
            <p> Francesca realizes this is her moment. She holds her head and 
              <br>
              leans over, unsteadily.</p>
            <p> MADGE (cont'd)<br>
              Honey, what's wrong?</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              I don't know. I woke up a little <br>
              dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think <br>
              I need to lay down.</p>
            <p> MADGE<br>
              You want me to call the doctor?</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              No, no. I just didn't sleep well. <br>
              I'm not used to sleeping alone. And <br>
              this heat. Would you mind?</p>
            <p> MADGE<br>
              No, of course not. I'll just clean up.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              No, leave it. I'll do it later. <br>
              Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come <br>
              for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure <br>
              Richard'll have so many stories to <br>
              tell you both about the fair and all.</p>
            <p> MADGE<br>
              Oh, that'll be nice.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY</p>
            <p> Francesca enters to find Richard, laying on the bed fully <br>
              clothed. She sits beside him. He strokes her arm, then guides <br>
              her to lay down. Once she's in his arms, he speaks.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              Come with me.</p>
            <p> Francesca knew he was going to say this. Either answer she <br>
              gives frightens her.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              Hold me.</p>
            <p> She turns to him and they embrace. Robert, however, fears <br>
              only one response. On the soundtrack, we hear the song &quot;DARN 
              <br>
              THAT DREAM.&quot;</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. KITCHEN - EVENING</p>
            <p> The song continues over the next few images. Camera slowly <br>
              pans from the radio, upon which the song is playing, to a <br>
              beautifully set table and candles. It arrives on Robert <br>
              preparing dinner.</p>
            <p> INT. BEDROOM</p>
            <p> Camera pans the room from two OPENED SUITCASES, as Francesca <br>
              packs to leave. She moves about the room as if with blinders <br>
              on -- focused on her task, refusing to take in any sign or <br>
              memories that might hinder her. She is wearing a RED DRESS, <br>
              with BUTTONS down the front.</p>
            <p> INT. KITCHEN</p>
            <p> Robert stands at the sink rinsing out some utensils. Waiting <br>
              for the water to turn hot, he looks out through the window <br>
              above the sink. He sees a beautiful view of beautiful night. <br>
              He pauses as it strikes him that this is a view Francesca has <br>
              seen a million times -- that soon she would not see ever again.</p>
            <p> INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING</p>
            <p> Camera follows her as she exits the bedroom with her <br>
              suitcases, then walks down the hall to the stairs, then down <br>
              the staircase to the front hall.</p>
            <p> She quietly sets the suitcases down, hearing the radio and <br>
              Robert in the kitchen. She pauses, then enters the living <br>
              room. One of the throw pillows has fallen off the couch. She <br>
              replaces it then takes a moment to look about the room. She <br>
              slowly sits down on the couch.</p>
            <p> We hear voices of the past, auditory memories conjured up by <br>
              each stick of furniture Francesca sees.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA (V.O.)<br>
              Michael, get off the back of that <br>
              chair! What did I tell you!</p>
            <p> WE HEAR HIM FALL AND BEGIN TO CRY.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA (V.O.)<br>
              All you all right, honey. Let me see...</p>
            <p> A sound of Christmas music... of toddlers running and <br>
              laughing... A birthday party for Carolyn...</p>
            <p> CAROLYN (V.O.)<br>
              Mama, look -- look at the dress Aunt <br>
              Patty sent!</p>
            <p> RICHARD (V.O.)<br>
              Franny, BONNAZA's on!</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              Francesca?</p>
            <p> Francesca snaps out for it and turns to find Robert.</p>
            <p> ROBERT (cont'd)<br>
              I've got dinner.</p>
            <p> She smiles.</p>
            <p> INT. KITCHEN</p>
            <p> They eat by candlelight. Neither speaks. Neither is very <br>
              hungry.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              Would you like a beer?</p>
            <p> She smiles and shakes her head. Robert opens a bottle and <br>
              takes a sip.</p>
            <p> ROBERT (cont'd)<br>
              You know what I'd like to do before <br>
              we leave? I'd like to take a picture <br>
              of you -- at Roseman bridge. Maybe <br>
              just as the sun's coming up.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              Yes. I'd like that.</p>
            <p> Pause. Robert smiles back and takes another sip. Then, <br>
              knowing full well what hangs heavy between them, he asks:</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              Tell me why you're not coming with me?</p>
            <p> Francesca stops pretending to eat. She looks at him, having <br>
              forgotten how well he can read her.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              No matter how I keep turning it <br>
              around in my mind -- it doesn't seem <br>
              like the right thing.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              For who?</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              For anyone. They'll never be able to <br>
              live through the talk. Richard will <br>
              never be able to. He doesn't deserve <br>
              that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his <br>
              life.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              (getting aggressive)<br>
              Then he can move! People move!</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              His family's lived for almost a <br>
              hundred years. Richard doesn't know <br>
              how to live anywhere else. And the <br>
              kids...</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              The kids are grown! They don't need <br>
              you anymore. You told me that. They <br>
              hardly talk to you.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              No, they don't say much. But <br>
              Carolyn's 16. She's just about to <br>
              find out about all this for herself <br>
              -- she's going to fall in love, <br>
              she's going to try and figure out <br>
              how to build a life with someone. <br>
              If I leave what does that say to her?</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              What about us? What about me?</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              You've got to know deep down that the <br>
              minute we leave here. It'll all <br>
              change.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              Yeah. It could get better.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              No matter how much distance we put <br>
              between us and this house, I bring <br>
              with it with me. And I'll feel it <br>
              every minute we're together. And I'll <br>
              blame loving you for how much it <br>
              hurts. And then even these four days <br>
              won't be anything more than something <br>
              sordid and... a mistake.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              (desperately)<br>
              Francesca, listen to me. You think <br>
              what's happened to us happens to just <br>
              anybody? What we feel for each other? <br>
              How much we feel? We're not even two <br>
              separate people anymore. Some people <br>
              search their whole lives for it and <br>
              wind up alone -- most people don't <br>
              even think it exists and you're going <br>
              to tell me that giving it up is the <br>
              right thing to do? That staying here <br>
              alone in a marriage, alone in a town <br>
              you hate, in a house you don't feel <br>
              apart of anymore -- you're telling me <br>
              that's the right thing to do!?</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              We are the choices we've made, Robert.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              (rises)<br>
              TO HELL WITH YOU!</p>
            <p> He turns his back on her.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              Robert. Please.<br>
              (desperate to explain)<br>
              You don't understand -- no one does. <br>
              When a woman makes the choice to <br>
              marry, to have children -- in one way <br>
              her life begins but in another way it <br>
              stops. You build a life of details. <br>
              You become a mother, a wife and you <br>
              stop and stay steady so that your <br>
              children can move. And when they <br>
              leave they take your life of details <br>
              with them. And then you're expected <br>
              move again only you don't remember <br>
              what moves you because no one has <br>
              asked in so long. Not even yourself. <br>
              You never in your life think that <br>
              love like this can happen to you.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              But now that you have it -</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              I want to keep it forever. I want to <br>
              love you the way I do now the rest of <br>
              my life. Don't you understand -- we'll <br>
              lose it if we leave. I can't make an <br>
              entire life disappear to start a new <br>
              one. All I can do is try to hold onto <br>
              to both. Help me. Help me not lose <br>
              loving you.</p>
            <p> She embraces him. He wraps his arms around her. He whispers.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              Don't leave me. Don't leave me alone. <br>
              Please.</p>
            <p> This breaks her heart, knowing how hard it is for him to say <br>
              this. She holds him tighter, until -</p>
            <p> ROBERT (cont'd)<br>
              Listen. Maybe you feel this way, <br>
              maybe you don't. Maybe it's just <br>
              because you're in this house. Maybe <br>
              ... maybe when they come back <br>
              tomorrow you'll feel differently. <br>
              Don't you think that's possible?</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              I don't know. Please...</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              I'm going to be here a few more days. <br>
              I'll be at the Inn. We have some <br>
              time. Let's not say any more now.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              No. Don't do this.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave <br>
              it for now. We're not saying goodbye. <br>
              We're not making any decision. Maybe <br>
              you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll <br>
              accidentally run into each other and <br>
              ... and you'll change your mind.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              Robert, if that happens, you'll have <br>
              to decide. I won't be able to.</p>
            <p> She cries in his arms. He kisses her as if for the last time. 
              <br>
              Then, quickly, separates himself and leaves the house.</p>
            <p> EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE</p>
            <p> Robert walks briskly towards his truck not wanting to look <br>
              back. He gets in, starts it up and drives away.</p>
            <p> Francesca exits the house and watches the truck recede into <br>
              the distance. She stops when she reaches the front gate, <br>
              leaning against it. She murmurs to herself -</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              Keep going. Please.</p>
            <p> The truck drives away. Then, suddenly, stops. Francesca's <br>
              heart quickens. She watches as the truck stands on the road <br>
              in the distance. As if Robert was deciding to turn around or <br>
              keep going. Francesca waits. Suddenly, the door to the truck <br>
              flies open and Robert exits. Francesca loses all restraint.</p>
            <p> She opens the gate but her dress is caught on it. Robert <br>
              stands by the truck. Francesca tears at the dress, ripping <br>
              off a button which falls to the ground. She runs down the <br>
              road. Seeing her, Robert runs towards her as well.</p>
            <p> They grab each other furiously. For these few moments, all <br>
              considerations are gone. As he kisses her, he murmurs:</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              I forgot to take your picture.</p>
            <p> She laughs through her tears as they continue to kiss. Camera 
              <br>
              pans up to the road beyond Robert's truck.</p>
            <p> WE SEE RICHARD'S TRUCK DRIVING TOWARDS THEM. For a moment it <br>
              seems as if they will be caught until we realize RICHARD'S <br>
              TRUCK IS BEING SUPERIMPOSED as the LIGHT GRADUALLY BRIGHTENS <br>
              TO REVEAL:</p>
            <p> MORNING.</p>
            <p> EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE</p>
            <p> Richard, Michael and Carolyn drive down the road toward the <br>
              house. Robert's truck, and all traces of him, are gone.</p>
            <p> Francesca steps into the doorway in a house dress to welcome <br>
              her family home -- wondering how this will feel.</p>
            <p> JOHNSON KITCHEN - EVENING</p>
            <p> The Johnson family has dinner as Francesca narrates:</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA (V.O.)<br>
              You all came home. And with you, my <br>
              life of details.</p>
            <p> EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE</p>
            <p> Everyone is doing various daily chores.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA (V.O.)<br>
              A day or two past and with each <br>
              thought of him, a task would present <br>
              itself like a life saver, pulling me <br>
              further and further away from those <br>
              four days.</p>
            <p> INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING</p>
            <p> Francesca is reading. Richard watches TV.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA (V.O.)<br>
              I was grateful. I felt safe.</p>

            <p><font face="宋体">　　希望你一切都好.我不知道你何时能收到此信,总是在我去世以后.我现</font><font face="宋体">已六十五岁,我们相逢在十三年前的今日,当我进入你的小巷问路之时.</font></p>

            <p><font face="宋体">　　可是我记得你的话,我尊重你的感情.也许你是对的,我不知道.我只知道</font><font face="宋体">在那个炎热的星期五从你的小巷开车出来是我一生中做过的最艰难的事以后</font><font face="宋体">也决不会再有.事实上我怀疑有多少男人曾做过这样艰难的事.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　我于一九七五年离开&lt;地理杂志&gt;以后的摄影生涯就致力于拍摄我自己挑</font><font face="宋体">选的对象,有机会时就在当地或者本地区找点事做,一次只外出几天经济比较</font><font face="宋体">困难,不过还过得去,我总是过得去的.</font></p>

            <p><font face="宋体">　　一九七二年我在缅因州阿卡迪亚国家公园的一座峭壁上摔了下来,跌断了</font><font face="宋体">踝骨,项链和圆牌一起给跌断了,幸亏是落在近处,我又找到了,请一位珠宝商</font><font face="宋体">修复了项链.</font></p>

            <p><font face="宋体">　　在雾蒙蒙的早晨,或是午后太阳在西北方水面上跳动时,我常试图想象你在</font><font face="宋体">哪里,在做什么.没什么复杂的事-不外乎到你的园子里去,坐在前廊的秋千</font><font face="宋体">上,站在你厨房洗涤池前之类的事.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　我样样都记得:你的气息,你夏天一般的味道,你紧贴我身上的皮肤的手感</font><font face="宋体">还有在我爱着你时你说悄悄话的声音.</font></p>

            <p><font face="宋体">　　但是我毕竟是一个男人.所有我能记起的一切哲学推理都不能阻止我要你,</font><font face="宋体">每天,每时,每刻,在我头脑深处是时间残忍的悲号,那永不能与你相聚的时间.</font></p>

            <p><font face="宋体">　　最后一道仪式是读文稿,她总是在一天结束时在烛光下读.她从起居间拿来这份文稿,小心地把它铺在贴面桌上蜡烛旁,点上她一年一支的香烟骆驼牌,啜一口白兰地,然后开始读.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　从零度空间落下</font></p>

            <p><font face="宋体">　　对有些古老的风我至今不解,虽然我一直是,而且似乎永远是乘着这些风卷曲的脊梁而行.我徜徉在零度空间,世界在别处另一种物体中与我平行运行.我看世界就像两手插在裤袋里弯身向商店橱窗里张望一样.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　在零度空间中常有奇异的时刻.一条长长的长路从马格达莱纳以西蜿蜓绕过多雨的新墨西哥,变成了人行小路,然后又变成野兽踩出来的羊肠小道.我车窗的乱水器一甩,羊肠小道变成了人迹兽迹都没有的洪荒森林.乱水器再一甩,又退回了一步,这下到了大冰原,我乱缠头发,身披兽衣,手拿长矛在杂草中行进,身体精瘦像冰一般坚硬,浑身肌肉,狡黠莫测.过了冰原,再沿着事物的发展阶段往回走,我在深盐水中游泳,长着鳃,深身是鳞.再往远处我就什么也看不见了.只见浮游生物之外是零这个数字.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　欧几里德不一定全对.他假定平行线一直到头都是平行的.但是非欧几里德式存在也是可能的.两条平行线在遥远的某处相遇.那相交点正在消失,是对会合的幻觉.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　但是我知道,我并非仅仅是幻觉而已.有时相会合是可能的-一种现实洋溢到另一种现实中去.那是轻柔的互相缠绕,而不是这个充斥着准确性的世界上所惯见的那种齐整的交织.没有穿梭声,只是.....呵气.对了,就是这声音,也是这感觉.呵气.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　于是我在这世外的现实之上,之旁,之下以及周围缓缓运行,总是强壮有力,同时也不断献出我自己.而那另一个觉察到了,于是带着它自己力量迎上来,同样把自己献给我.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　在这呵气之中的某个地方有乐声飘飘,于是那奇异的,盘旋上升的舞蹈开始了,完全踏着自己特有节拍,把那个缠头发手拿长矛的冰纪人炼化.缓缓地,在柔和的乐声中总是柔和--那冰纪人落下来,从零度空间落下来.....落到她的体内.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　弗朗西丝卡六十七岁生日这一天结束时雨已停止,她把牛皮纸信封放回书桌最下面的抽屉.理查德去世后她决定把这包东西放进她银行的保险柜里,不过每年此时拿回来几天.盖上胡桃木匣子的盖子,把相机关在里面.匣子放进她卧室壁柜的子上.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　下午早些时候她曾去过罗斯曼桥.现在她走到前廊,用毛巾擦干秋千,坐在上面,这里很凉,但是她要呆几分钟,每次都是这样.她走到庭院门口站着,然后走到小巷口.事隔二十二年之后她仍然看见他在近黄昏的午后走出卡车来问路,她还能看见哈里颠簸着驶向乡间公路然后停下-罗伯特.金凯站在踏板上,回头望着小巷.</font></p>

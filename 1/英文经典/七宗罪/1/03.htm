              20 INT. AUTOPSY ROOM -- DAY 20</p>
            <p> The room is large, cold and clean. Stainless steel and white tile. 
              Many pathologists work at slabs. A bone saw screams.<br>
              Mills and Somerset are with DOCTOR SANTIAGO, who stands over the 
              obese corpse which is pretty well dissected already.</p>
            <p> SANTIAGO<br>
              He's been dead for a long time, and I can tell you it was not a 
              poison.</p>
            <p> Santiago moves to make room for Mills to stand beside him. Mills<br>
              moves up a little, but not much, looking on in disgust. Santiago<br>
              reaches into the man's belly. We do not see.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Ah, man... how does somebody let himself go like that? Look at the 
              blubber.</p>
            <p> Santiago moves something and there is a squashy sound.</p>
            <p> SANTIAGO<br>
              It took four orderlies and me all together just to put this body 
              on the table.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              How did the fat fuck ever fit out the door of his apartment?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Yes, it's obvious he was a shut-in. Not an enviable life, but, maybe 
              he still deserves a modicum of respect in spite of that.</p>
            <p> SANTIAGO<br>
              Are you looking here? First... see how big this stomach is. And, 
              see the strange thing. Stretches. And, here it is distended. Look 
              at the size of that, because of all the foods.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I can see what you're pointing at, but...</p>
            <p> SANTIAGO<br>
              Lines of distention across the stomach, and parts have ripped open.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (disbelief)<br>
              Doctor, are you saying... this man ate till he burst?</p>
            <p> SANTIAGO<br>
              Well, he didn't really burst. Not all the way. But, he was bleeding 
              inside himself, and there is a hematoma on the outside, on the belly. 
              Very large.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              He died by eating?</p>
            <p> SANTIAGO<br>
              Yes. And, there's something else here you have to look at and see.</p>
            <p> Santiago goes to root through many jars on a table. Somerset<br>
              walks around the slab, looking down at the obese man's propped<br>
              up, partially shaved head.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              These bruises on the victim's head...</p>
            <p> More round and semi-circular bruises have been revealed, all about 
              the same diameter as a dime.</p>
            <p> SANTIAGO<br>
              I don't kow what they are yet. They...</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              They could have been caused by a gun. The barrel of a gun... pressed 
              against the back of his head.</p>
            <p> Santiago picks up the jar he was looking for, comes to lean and<br>
              look at the obese man's head, nodding again.</p>
            <p> SANTIAGO<br>
              If it was jammed against him hard enough, sure. It's possible. Here...</p>
            <p> Santiago gives the jar to Somerset.</p>
            <p> SANTIAGO<br>
              Most of the stomach's food contents are in the lab now.... but, 
              these... I found these in his stomach too.</p>
            <p> Somerset holds the jar up. Inside are many little pieces of blue<br>
              plastic. They are curled slightly, as if they are scrapings.<br>
              Somerset hands the jar to Mills. Mills shakes it, studying.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Plastic?</p>
            <p> SANTIAGO<br>
              Why these are in a fat man's stomach, I don't know.</p>
            <p>21 INT. APARTMENT, KITCHEN -- DAY 21</p>
            <p> The room where the obese corpse was found is now lit by<br>
              fluorescent light. Two forensics, a MALE and FEMALE, are dusting<br>
              for prints. Somerset and Mills are on their hands and knees.<br>
              Somerset holds the jar and touches the linoleum floor.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Same color and texture.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (to forensics)<br>
              Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink? Near 
              the food?</p>
            <p> MALE FORENSIC<br>
              What do you mean?</p>
            <p> Mills and Somerset continue looking around the floor.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (to Somerset)<br>
              This doesn't make any sense.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              You always have to find one singular thing to focus on. There's 
              always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but<br>
              you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.</p>
            <p> The forensics watch, curious. Somerset is near the refrigerator.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              It could be nothing.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were 
              nothing? It must have been intentional.</p>
            <p> Somerset stops. There are deep scratches here in the linoleum.<br>
              He fingers the grooves, then takes a piece of the plastic from<br>
              the jar. He holds the piece to the floor, fiddles... fits it into 
              one of the scratches.</p>
            <p> Somerset gets off the floor and looks down. These scratches are<br>
              in front of the refrigerator. it looks like they were caused by<br>
              the refrigerator having been pulled away from the wall and pushed<br>
              back into place at some time.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (to Mills)<br>
              Come here.</p>
            <p>22 INT. APARTMENT, KITCHEN -- LATER DAY 22</p>
            <p> Mills and Somerset pull the refrigerator, rocking it back and 
              forth away from the wall to get a clear view behind it. They strain, 
              pull it a few more feet, and release.</p>
            <p> Mills leans to look at the wall behind. Shock.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Holy shit.</p>
            <p> Somerset comes to look. Behind the refrigerator, there is a<br>
              space on the wall where the dust has been wiped away. In that<br>
              space, the words: ONE IS GLUTTONY. The letters have been<br>
              smeared on in grease. A NOTE is pinned beside them.</p>
            <p>23 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING 23</p>
            <p> The captain's office is filled with pictures, books and mugsheets. 
              Piles of paperwork abound, yet the office is meticulously well kept. 
              The CAPTAIN, 50, sits at his tidy desk.<br>
              He wears a white shirt and conservative tie.</p>
            <p> He's a calm man, but whenever he is not speaking, without fail,<br>
              he clenches his jaw over and over, causing the muscles in his<br>
              neck and jaw to pulse. Somerset and Mills sit before him.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              The bruises were caused by the muzzle of a forty-five. So, there 
              was a gun against his head and he was given a choice. Eat, or get 
              your brains blown out.</p>
            <p> Somerset gets up to pace.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body 
              rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then 
              kept serving. He took his time. The coroner says this might have 
              gone on for more than twelve hours. The victim's throat was swollen 
              from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed 
              out. That's when killer kicked him in the stomach. Popped him.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              This was one sadistic motherfucker.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              That seems obvious.</p>
            <p> Somerset picks up a photocopy of the NOTE from behind the fridge.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (reads)<br>
              &quot;Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell 
              leads up to light.&quot; It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Announcing what?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony, wrath, greed...</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              So what? This victim...</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              ... envy, sloth, pride and lust. Seven.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins. But, this was 
              a fat guy. The killer may have felt this was the just best way to 
              torture him.<br>
              (MORE)</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN (cont'd)<br>
              And, writing on the walls happens all the time. It's like the fashionable 
              thing to do.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              ONE is gluttony.</p>
            <p> The captain is disgruntled, clenching his jaw, looks at Mills.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              This is his stuff. I've been out in the cold all day.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Always working up there, huh, Somerset?<br>
              Big brain's always cooking.</p>
            <p> Somerset sits.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I'm declining this case. I want us reassigned.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Whoa, whoa... what?!</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              What's this: &quot;I'm declining this case?&quot; It don't work 
              that way.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              This can't be my last duty here. It will go on and on.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              I know what you're thinking, okay? You don't want to get in bed 
              with this every night, but it's different now. You're retiring. 
              In six days you're all the way gone.</p>
            <p> Somerset shakes his head.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              You've left unfinished business before.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible. 
              Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              This isn't my first assignment, dickhead.<br>
              What the hell?</p>
            <p> Mills stands, furious.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that. 
              And nobody's going to swap with you.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Give it to me.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              How's that?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              There's nothing that says I have to work with him. If Somerset wants 
              out, &quot;goodbye.&quot; Give it to me.</p>
            <p> The captain considers this.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              It's too soon for him.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (to the captain)<br>
              Can we talk about this in private?</p>
            <p> The captain looks at Somerset, then at Mills.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              That's not necessary. You're in.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              Go start picking up the pieces. We'll shuffle some paper and try 
              to get you a new partner.</p>
            <p> Mills looks at Somerset, then leaves, closing the door. Somerset<br>
              seems deflated, staring at the floor. He looks at the captain.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              You win, Somerset. You're out.</p>

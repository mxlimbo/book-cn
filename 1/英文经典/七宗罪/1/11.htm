              72 INT. SOMERSET'S CAR -- DAY 72</p>
            <p> The car is parked with Somerset at the wheel and Mills beside.<br>
              They're looking through pages of connected computer paper.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              This is a waste of time.</p>

              We're focusing.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>

            <p>73 INT. TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL/HALLWAY -- DAY 73</p>
            <p> Somerset and Mills walk up the stairs and turn a corner into this<br>
              long hall. Somerset is looking at the computer sheets.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You're sure you're reading that right?<br>
              John Doe?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              That's what it says. Jonathan Doe.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              This is stupid. It'd be just too easy.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              We'll take a look at him. Talk to him.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Sure. Uh, excuse me... are you by any chance a serial killer? Oh, 
              you are?<br>
              Well, come with us then, if it's okay.</p>
            <p> They reach a door, apartment 6A. Somerset knocks.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What are you going to say?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              You do the talking. Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Who told you about my silver tongue? You been talking to my wife?</p>
            <p> Mills knocks on the door, hard.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              This is really lame.</p>
            <p> A CREAK is HEARD O.S. Somerset turns to look towards it...</p>
            <p> A male figure, JOHN DOE, is standing at the stairwell, wearing 
              a<br>
              hat and standing in shadow, looking towards them. Stark still.</p>
            <p> Somerset furrows his brow.</p>
            <p> The John Doe reaches into his coat, lifts his arm, pointing...</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Mills... !</p>
            <p> BLAM -- GUNFIRE SOUNDS, deafening, as a bullet slams into door<br>
              6A, just missing Somerset as he and Mills hit the floor.</p>
            <p> John Doe fires again...</p>
            <p> The bullet blows a huge hole in the wall, throwing plaster. A<br>
              third bullet follows, just above Mills and Somerset, and John Doe<br>
              is heard running back down the stairs.</p>
            <p> The gunfire's still echoing, ringing, as Mills gets up and unholsters 
              his gun.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Jesus Christ...</p>
            <p> Mills scrambles down the stairwell...</p>
            <p> IN THE STARWELL</p>
            <p> Mills bounds down stairs, turns a corner and leaps down another<br>
              flight. He halts on the landing, listening. John Doe can be HEARD 
              still RUNNING, below.</p>
            <p> IN THE HALL ABOVE</p>
            <p> Somerset rolls and takes out his gun. He stands, dazed.</p>
            <p> MILLS (o.s.)<br>
              (from in stairwell)<br>
              What kind of gun was it?</p>
            <p> IN THE STAIRWELL</p>
            <p> Somerset comes into the stairwell.</p>
            <p> MILLS (o.s.)<br>
              (from below)<br>
              Damn it, Somerset... what kind of gun?!<br>
              How many bullets?</p>
            <p> BELOW, IN THE STAIRWELL</p>
            <p> Mills hurries down more stairs.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET (o.s.)<br>
              (from above)<br>
              I don't know. Might've been a revolver.</p>
            <p> Voices echo. Mills loses his footing, falls...</p>
            <p> Mills hits the next landing hard, dropping his gun.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Fuck!</p>
            <p> Mills gets back up and picks up his gun and keeps going.</p>
            <p> ABOVE IN THE STAIRWELL</p>
            <p> the stairs, breathing hard.</p>
            <p> MILLS (o.s.)<br>
              (from below)<br>
              What's he look like?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Brown hat. Tan raincoat... like a... like a trench coat.</p>
            <p> BELOW IN THE STAIRWELL</p>
            <p> ready, moves to peer over the railing, down into stairwell's center...</p>
            <p> in shadow, aiming his gun straight up...</p>
            <p> s SHOT is FIRED from below and the bullet is</p>
            <p> ABOVE</p>
            <p> Somerset splinters into a million pieces, sends Somerset ducking 
              for cover.</p>
            <p> far below -- the bullet is HEARD RICOCHETING</p>
            <p> BELOW</p>
            <p> waiting as the gunshot echoes.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (to himself)<br>
              Five... that's five...</p>
            <p> continues down the stairs.</p>
            <p> INT. TENEMENT BUILDING, LOWER HALLWAY -- DAY</p>
            <p> stairs and into a hallway, falling to one knee, ing his gun one 
              direction -- empty hallway.</p>
            <p> direction, gun hand shaking, catches a glimpse of John Doe just 
              as he disappears around a corner far Mills gets up, looking back 
              to the number 2 by ooks, shouting back towards the stairwell...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Second floor! Second floor!</p>
            <p> FOLLOW him, tearing ass...</p>
            <p></p>
            <p> rn, full speed ahead, bringing his gun up...</p>
            <p> John Doe's running...</p>
            <p> Mills takes aim...</p>
            <p> Ahead, between John Doe and Mills, a tenant in t-shirt and<br>
              underwear comes out an apartment, looking towards John Doe,<br>
              blocking the line of fire...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Get down! Move... !</p>
            <p> The tenant turns to Mills, confused. Mills pushes angrily<br>
              past...</p>
            <p> Ahead, John Doe makes an abrupt halt. A woman tenant is looking<br>
              out her door and John Doe grabs her and throws her into the hall.<br>
              She falls as John Doe shoves his way into her apartment.</p>
            <p> BACK AT THE STAIRWELL</p>
            <p> Somerset comes down the stairs, tired. He runs.</p>
            <p> AROUND THE CORNER, IN THE OTHER HALLWAY SECTION</p>
            <p> Mills reaches the apartment Doe entered, bursting in...</p>
            <p>74 INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT -- DAY 74</p>
            <p> Mills enters, gun up. It's a railroad apartment, with all the<br>
              rooms adjoining in a row. At the far end of the apartment, John<br>
              Doe can be seen moving out one room's window onto a fire escape<br>
              just as that room's door is swinging shut.</p>
            <p> Mills charges through the apartment, full on...</p>
            <p> He bashes through the closed door...</p>
            <p>75 EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING, FIRE ESCAPE -- DAY 75</p>
            <p> Mills leans out the window over an alleyway. BLAM -- GUNSHOT.<br>
              The window above Mills' shatters and Mills pulls back.</p>
            <p> Mills leans back out, fanning with his gun, searching.</p>
            <p> Below, John Doe runs out the alleyway's mouth and rounds a<br>
              corner, gone.</p>
            <p> Mills curses, scrambling out onto the fire escape, running a few<br>
              steps and then vaulting the rail... crashes down on the roof of 
              a<br>
              car parked below. The windshield cracks. Mills jumps off and<br>
              continues the pursuit...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (to himself)<br>
              That's six...</p>
            <p>76 EXT. CITY STREET -- DAY 76</p>
            <p> Mills rounds the alleyway corner into people packed streets.</p>
            <p> Several people are running, heading several different directions.</p>
            <p> Mills comes to a halt, his focus confused, searching desperately.<br>
              Others run upon seeing his gun. Woman scream and grab up their<br>
              children. Mills can't see far down the sidewalk because of all<br>
              the people. He moves forward...</p>
            <p> He jumps atop a fire hydrant, gripping a street sign for balance,<br>
              trying to see further down the street.</p>
            <p> MILLS' P.O.V. -- There he is! John Doe can be seen, far off,<br>
              moving across the street, through traffic, to the opposite sidewalk.</p>
            <p> ON THE STREET, Mills runs, into traffic, avoiding cars, down the<br>
              center line. Angry drivers scream at him.</p>
            <p> Ahead, John Doe glances back, ducking into an alley.</p>
            <p> Mills gets to the other sidewalk, yelling for people to get out<br>
              of the way...</p>
            <p>77 EXT. CITY ALLEYWAY -- DAY 77</p>
            <p> Mills comes to this tight alleyway. It's dark, with a long,<br>
              tall, vertical sliver of daylight far ahead. Mills runs...</p>
            <p> Charging hard onwards...</p>
            <p> A two-by-four swings out from a hidden nook along the side of 
              the<br>
              alleyway -- slamming Mills in the face with a THWACK!!</p>
            <p> Mills' gun hits the alley wall and clatters into a puddle.</p>
            <p> Mills hits the dirt, on his back, nose broken and split, face<br>
              bloodied. He cries out, rolling to his side, clutching his face.</p>
            <p> The two-by-four is dropped. John Doe's feet cross a short<br>
              distance. Doe's hand reaches to pick up Mills' gun. (We never<br>
              see John Doe's face.)</p>
            <p> Mills still lies on his side, stunned, spitting blood and<br>
              cursing, when he feels the barrel of his gun against the side of<br>
              his face. Mills freezes.</p>
            <p> John Doe moves the gun slowly across Mills' face, till the barrel<br>
              reaches Mills' mouth. The barrel is inserted between his lips.</p>
            <p> The gun's hammer is pulled back.</p>
            <p> Mills quakes, tries to open his eyes, but he's blinded by the<br>
              blood from his broken nose. For an instant, there is a sudden,<br>
              BRIGHT FLASH of LIGHT.</p>
            <p> After a long moment, the gun withdrawals. From O.S., the bullets<br>
              fall out of Mills gun onto his chest.</p>
            <p> The gun is dropped. John Doe runs towards the sliver of light.<br>
              He's gone.</p>
            <p> Mills lies for a long moment, gasping. At the alleyway's entrance,<br>
              Somerset appears.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Mills...</p>
            <p> Mills rolls, shaken, feeling to pick up the bullets and trying 
              to<br>
              rub the blood out of his eyes with his shirt sleeve. Somerset<br>
              arrives.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Are you alright?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I'm fine.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              What happened?</p>
            <p> Mills gets up, collects his gun and pockets it, then walks past<br>
              Somerset, heading back.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Mills... ?</p>
            <p> Mills starts running. Somerset runs to follow.</p>

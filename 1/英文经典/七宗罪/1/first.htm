            <p> by Andrew Kevin Walker<br>
            </p>
            <p> 8/8/94<br>
              <br>
              1 INT. OLD HOUSE -- DAY 1</p>
            <p> Sunlight comes through the soot on the windows, more brown than 
              bright. SOMERSET, 45, stands in one corner of this small, second-story 
              room. He looks over the ceiling, looks down at the worn wooden floors, 
              looks at the peeling wallpaper.</p>
            <p> He walks to the center of the room, continues his study, taking<br>
              his time. He halts, turns to one wall where the current wallpaper 
              is torn away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath.</p>
            <p> Somerset goes to this wall and runs his finger across one of the<br>
              pale, red roses which decorates the older paper. He pushes the<br>
              grime away, brings the rose out more clearly.</p>
            <p> He reaches into his suit pocket and takes out a switchblade. He<br>
              flips the thin, lethal blade free. Working deliberately, delicately, 
              Somerset cuts a square around the rose, then peels the square of 
              dry wallpaper away from the wall. He studies it in his hand.</p>
            <p>2 EXT. OLD HOUSE -- DAY 2</p>
            <p> Somerset stands in front of the old home. He looks out at the<br>
              surrounding farms and forests. He ponders something. Birds sing.</p>
            <p> MAN (O.S.)<br>
              Is something wrong?</p>
            <p> Somerset does not respond, just stares off. The MAN, 34, wears 
              a<br>
              real-estate broker's jacket and stands beside a FOR SALE sign in<br>
              the muddy lawn.</p>
            <p> MAN<br>
              Is there something the matter?</p>
            <p> Somerset turns to face the man, then looks back at the house.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              No. No... it's just that everything here seems... so strange.</p>
            <p> MAN<br>
              Strange? There's nothing strange about this place. The house'll 
              need a little fixing up, that's for sure...</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              No. I like the house, and this place.</p>
            <p> MAN<br>
              I was about to say. Cause this place is about as normal as places 
              get.</p>
            <p> Somerset nods, taking a deep breath. He smiles.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              That's what I mean. Strange.</p>
            <p> Somerset looks back to the beautiful landscape. The man does not<br>
              understand.</p>
            <p>3 INT. AMTRACK TRAIN -- LATER DAY 3</p>
            <p> Somerset is in the window seat, looking out the window of the<br>
              speeding train, smoking a cigarette. He is near the back of the 
              car, away from the few other passengers.</p>
            <p> Outside, farms, fields, small homes and lawns rush by. The panorama 
              is dappled by the rays of the soon to be setting sun.</p>
            <p>4 INT. AMTRACK TRAIN -- LATER DAY 4</p>
            <p> The train is almost full, moving slower. Somerset has his suitcase 
              on the aisle seat beside him. He holds a hardcover book unopened 
              on his lap. He still stares out the window, but his face is tense. 
              The train is passing an ugly, swampy field. The sun has gone under.</p>
            <p> Though it seems impossible it ever could have gotten there, a 
              car's burnt-out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken.</p>
            <p> Ahead, the city waits. The sky is full of smokestacks and huge<br>
              industrial cranes.</p>
            <p>5 INT. AMTRACK TRAIN -- LATER DAY 5</p>
            <p> The train is passing urban streets below. Slums and smashed cars. 
              People stand in groups in the corners. Bleak.</p>
            <p> Somerset's suitcase is now on the window seat. Somerset has moved 
              to the aisle. He is reading his book. He looks up from the book 
              and rubs his eyes, then looks back to continue reading, not once 
              looking out the window.</p>
            <p>6 EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT 6</p>
            <p> Somerset carries his suitcase outside the train station. The city 
              demands attention: cars screeching, people yelling, sirens blaring.</p>
            <p> Somerset passes a family of bewildered tourists. A WEIRD MAN has 
              a hand on the tourist-father's suitcase.</p>
            <p> It has become a tugging match with the Weird Man shouting, &quot;I'll<br>
              take you to a taxi... I'll take you.&quot; Ahead, a group is gathered<br>
              on the sidewalk near two ambulances. People clamor to get a look<br>
              at a BLOODY BODY which lies on the street.</p>
            <p> Policeman try to hold the crowd off. Ambulance attendants<br>
              administer aid to the victim, who convulses. Somerset moves by,<br>
              ignoring it all. He motions for a cab. One pulls up from the street's 
              stream of vehicles.</p>
            <p>7 INT. CAB -- NIGHT 7</p>
            <p> Somerset throws his suitcase in and shuts the door behind him.</p>
            <p> CAB DRIVER<br>
              (about the crowd)<br>
              What's the big fuss?</p>
            <p> Somerset looks out at the crowd, looks at the driver.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Why do you care?</p>
            <p> CAB DRIVER<br>
              (under his breath)<br>
              Well, excuse me all to hell.</p>
            <p> The driver leans forward, checking it out. The circle of spectators 
              shifts suddenly. A man has shoved another man and they're really 
              going at it now. The swing at each other and tear at each other's 
              clothing. One man's flailing fist connects and the other man's face 
              is instantly bloodied. The fight grows even more spastic. Policemen 
              try to stop it.</p>
            <p> CAB DRIVER<br>
              Crazy fucks.</p>
            <p> The driver pulls away and the cab rages down the street.<br>
              Somerset watches the parade of neon passing on the avenue. He<br>
              slumps back in the seat and closes his eyes.</p>
            <p> CAB DRIVER<br>
              Where you headed?</p>
            <p> Somerset opens his eyes.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Far away from here.</p>
            <p>8 INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 8</p>
            <p> The curtains are closed. The SOUNDS of the CITY are here as they<br>
              will be everywhere in this story. A CAR ALARM is SOUNDING,<br>
              shrill and clear. Somerset's life is packed into moving boxes,<br>
              except for some clothing in a closet and hundreds and hundreds of<br>
              books on the shelves of one wall. Somerset is lying on the bed,<br>
              dressed only in his underwear.</p>
            <p> He reaches to the nightstand, to a wooden, pyramidical metronome.<br>
              He frees the metronome's weighted swingarm so it moves back and<br>
              forth. Swings to the left -- TICK, swings to the right -- TICK.<br>
              Tick... tick... tick... measured and steady.</p>
            <p> Somerset situates on the bed, closes his eyes. Tick... tick... 
              tick. The metronome's sound competes with the sound of the car alarm. 
              Somerset's face tightens as he concentrates on the metronome. His 
              eyes close tighter. Tick... tick... tick. The swingarm moves evenly. 
              Somerset's breathing deepens.</p>
            <p> Tick... tick... tick. The car alarm seems quieter.</p>
            <p> Tick... tick... tick. Somerset continues his concentration. The<br>
              metronome's sound seems louder.</p>
            <p> Tick... tick... tick. The sound of the car alarm fades, and is 
              GONE. The metronome is the only sound.</p>
            <p> Somerset's face relaxes as he begins to fall asleep. Tick...<br>
              tick... tick...</p>
            <p> INSERT -- TITLE CARD</p>
            <p> SUNDAY</p>
            <p>9 INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT -- MORNING 9</p>
            <p> Somerset picks items off a moving box: his keys, wallet,<br>
              switchblade, gold homicide badge. Finally, he opens the<br>
              hardcover book he had with him on the train. From the pages, he<br>
              takes the pale, paper rose.</p>
            <p>10 INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT -- DAY 10</p>
            <p> Somerset stands before a wall which is stained by a star-burst 
              of<br>
              blood. A body lies on the floor under a sheet. A sawed-off<br>
              shotgun lies not far from the body. The apartment is gloomy.</p>
            <p> DETECTIVE TAYLOR, 52, stands on the other side of the room, looks 
              through a notepad.</p>
            <p> TAYLOR<br>
              Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours. 
              It was nothing new. But, then they heard the gun go off.<br>
              Both barrels.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Did the wife confess?</p>
            <p> TAYLOR<br>
              When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together. 
              She was crying too hard to say anything.</p>
            <p> Somerset beings walking around the apartment.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Why always like this? Only after the fact... this sudden realization, 
              that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person 
              will cease to exist.</p>
            <p> TAYLOR<br>
              Crime of passion.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Yes. Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.</p>
            <p> TAYLOR<br>
              This is a done deal. All but the paperwork.</p>
            <p> Taylor shifts his weight, impatient. Somerset looks at a coloring 
              book open on the coffee table. There are crayons beside it. Somerset 
              picks the book up, flips through the pages.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Did their son see it happen?</p>
            <p> TAYLOR<br>
              I don't know.</p>
            <p> Taylor closes his notebook, perturbed. Somerset looks at the pictures 
              of cute, crudely colored animals.</p>
            <p> TAYLOR<br>
              What kind of fucking question is that anyway?</p>
            <p> Taylor walks over and grabs the coloring book to get his attention.</p>
            <p> TAYLOR<br>
              You know, we're all real glad we're getting rid of you, Somerset. 
              You know that? I mean, it's always these questions with you... &quot;Did 
              the kid see it?&quot; Well, who gives a fuck? Huh?<br>
              (points)<br>
              He's dead. His wife killed him.</p>
            <p> Taylor throws the coloring book back to Somerset and walks.</p>
            <p> TAYLOR<br>
              Anything else has nothing to do with us.</p>
            <p> Taylor leaves, pushing past DETECTIVE DAVID MILLS, 31, who is<br>
              just entering. Mills is muscular and handsome. He looks back at<br>
              Taylor, then around the apartment, a bit disoriented.</p>
            <p> Somerset puts down the coloring book. He stares at the floor,<br>
              showing no reaction to Taylor's tantrum.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Uh, Lieutenant Somerset?</p>
            <p> Somerset turns to see Mills.</p>
            <p>11 EXT. CITY STREET -- DAY 11</p>
            <p> A body bag is carried through a crowd of people outside the<br>
              tenement building.</p>
            <p> Somerset follows the body bag out and Mills follows Somerset.<br>
              They walk towards the end of the filthy block, past a man<br>
              urinating on a car.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I'm a little thrown. I just got in town like twenty minutes ago 
              and they dumped me here.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... 
              sit and talk for awhile. After that, we'll...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (interrupting)<br>
              Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct 
              house a.s.a.p. Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole 
              transition thing.</p>
            <p> Somerset keeps walking, says nothing.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I need to start getting the feel of it all, right? Meet the people.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone. 
              I can't help wondering... why here? </p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I... I don't follow.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question 
              that pops into my head.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess. Or, at least, the 
              same reasons you used to have for being here before...<br>
              before you decided to... quit.</p>
            <p> Somerset stops and faces Mills.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              You just met me.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Maybe I'm not understanding the question.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              It's very simple. You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought 
              to get here as if your life depended on it. I've just never seen 
              it done that way before, Detective.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there. I don't know. 
              Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each 
              other in the balls. But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... 
              <br>
              however you want it to go.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Let me tell you how I want this to go. I want you to look, and I 
              want you to listen.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell. I've worked 
              homicide for five and a half years. </p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Not here.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I realize that.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it.</p>
            <p> Somerset turns and walks away. Mills stands a moment, pissed.<br>
              He follows after Somerset.</p>

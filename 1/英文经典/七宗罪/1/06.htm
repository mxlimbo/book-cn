              43 INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT 43</p>
            <p> Food is cooking on the stove. Tracy is in the living room area<br>
              carefully setting the table with good silver and china.</p>
            <p> The door the the apartment is HEARD OPENING and CLOSING. Mills 
              and Somerset come down a short hallway. Mills carries a brand<br>
              new briefcase.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              Hello, men. You made it.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Hi, honey.</p>
            <p> Mills gives Tracy a kiss, then presents Somerset.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I'd like you to meet Somerset.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Hello.</p>
            <p> Somerset shakes Tracy's hand lightly.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              It's nice to meet you. My husband has told me a lot about you... 
              except your first name.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Oh... um, William.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              It's a nice name. William, I'd like you to meet David.<br>
              (to Mills)<br>
              David... William.</p>
            <p> Mills smiles and nods this off, heading across the room.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Great... I'm, uh, just going to put these things away.</p>
            <p> Mills moves to the adjoining bedroom. Somerset stands with his<br>
              hands folded in front of him.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              It smells good.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              What? Oh, yes. I mean, thank you.<br>
              (motions to the table)<br>
              Please, sit down.</p>
            <p> Somerset takes off his jacket. Tracy goes to check on the food.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              You can put that over on the couch. You'll have to excuse all the 
              mess. We're still unpacking.</p>
            <p> Somerset notices something on Mills' desk. It's a medal, in a 
              small, clear case amongst the papers and pens.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              High school and college, yes. Pretty hokey, huh? I knew on our first 
              date this was the man I was going to marry. God...<br>
              he was the funniest man I'd ever met.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Really?</p>
            <p> Somerset has to think about that one for a second. He picks the<br>
              medal up: a medal for valor from the Police Department.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Well, it's rare these days... that kind of commitment.</p>
            <p> He puts the medal down. Tracy is looking at the gun strapped<br>
              under Somerset's arm as Somerset starts to unstrap it.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (about the gun)<br>
              Don't worry. I don't wear it at the dinner table.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.</p>
            <p> Somerset lays the gun with his jacket.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Same here.</p>
            <p> Tracy smiles. Somerset goes to the table and transfers a small<br>
              notebook from his breast pocket to his pants pocket. A piece of<br>
              paper falls to the floor, closer to Tracy.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              Anyway... what girl wouldn't want the captain of the football team 
              as their lifetime mate? Here... you dropped something...</p>
            <p> Tracy picks it up. It is the pale, paper rose. She looks at it 
              as she hands it back to Somerset, who is self-conscious.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              What is that?</p>
            <p> Somerset looks at the rose, then puts it away.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              My future.</p>
            <p> Tracy tilts her head, looking at Somerset.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting. I'm sorry. 
              It's really none of my business. It's just nice to meet a man who 
              talks like that.<br>
              (goes back to stove)<br>
              If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag. That's how he is.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (smiles)<br>
              I guess I won't be showing it to him then.</p>
            <p>44 INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- LATER NIGHT 44</p>
            <p> A record player on a moving box PLAYS QUIET MUSIC. Tracy, Mills<br>
              and Somerset are eating. Mills has a beeper beside his plate and<br>
              occasionally fingers it absently.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              Why aren't you married, William?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Tracy... what the hell?</p>
            <p> Somerset pokes at the napkin, thinking.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I was close once. It just didn't happen.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              It surprises me. It really does.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds 
              me... disagreeable.<br>
              Just ask your husband.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Very true.</p>
            <p> Mills grins, but he means it.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              (to Somerset)<br>
              How long have you lived here?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Too long.<br>
              (drinks)<br>
              What do you think so far?</p>
            <p> Tracy glances immediately to Mills.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              It takes time to settle in.</p>
            <p> Somerset can see it is a sore subject.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Well, you can get numb to it pretty quickly.<br>
              There are things in any city...</p>
            <p> A LOW RUMBLING is HEARD. Plates on the table begin to clatter.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Subway train.</p>
            <p> The dishes clatter more. Coffee cups clink against their saucers. 
              Tracy holds her coffee cup to stop it and smiles at Somerset to 
              act like it's nothing, but she is clearly bothered.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              It'll go away in a minute.</p>
            <p> They wait. The rumbling grows louder, knocks something over in<br>
              the sink. Somerset continues eating, fiddles with his food. The<br>
              record player skips, then plays on. The clattering dies down.<br>
              Mills seems uncomfortable.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              This real estate guy... this miserable fuck, he brought us to see 
              this place a few times. And, first I'm thinking he's good, really 
              efficient. But then, I started wondering, why does he keep hurrying 
              us<br>
              along? Why will he only show us this place for like five minutes 
              at a time?</p>
            <p> Mills laughs lamely.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              We found out the first night.</p>
            <p> Somerset tries to stay straight, but he can't help laughing.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              The soothing, relaxing, vibrating home.<br>
              Sorry...</p>
            <p> He laughs harder, covering his mouth. Tracy and Mills laugh.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Oh, fuck.</p>
            <p>45 INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- LATER NIGHT 45</p>
            <p> The record player plays another album. Tracy brings over a pot<br>
              of coffee and pours. Mills and Somerset have beers.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              I don't think I've ever met anyone who doesn't have a television 
              before.<br>
              That's... weird.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              It's un-American is what it is.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be 
              stupid and eat candy bars all day.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What about sports?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              What about them?</p>
            <p> Tracy brings over a plate of cookies and puts it on the table.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You go to movies at least?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I read. Remember reading?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen &quot;Green 
              Acres.&quot;</p>
            <p> Somerset gives a blank stare. Tracy walks across the room.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You've NEVER seen &quot;The Odd Couple?&quot; This is sick. &quot;The 
              Honeymooners?!&quot;</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.</p>
            <p> Tracy turns the record player down further, then goes into the<br>
              bedroom and shuts the door behind her.</p>
            <p> Somerset and Mills look a the closed door. A long moment. They<br>
              look at each other, then sit for a time. Somerset puts down his<br>
              beer, sighs. He looks around.</p>

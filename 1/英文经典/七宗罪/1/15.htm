              103 INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT 103</p>
            <p> Mills comes quietly into the dark bedroom. Tracy is asleep on<br>
              the bed. Mills takes off his suit jacket, puts it down. He sits<br>
              on a chair and unties one shoe, takes it off, then looks at<br>
              Tracy. Looks at her a long moment.</p>
            <p> He puts the shoe on the floor and goes to get on the bed. He<br>
              kisses his wife's forehead, kisses her cheek, then wraps his arms<br>
              under and around her. He holds her tight, kisses her again.<br>
              Tracy stirs.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              Honey?</p>
            <p> Mills runs his fingers along her face.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I love you.</p>
            <p> Mills holds her tighter. She wraps her arms around him. They lie 
              together, clinging, holding tighter still.</p>
            <p>104 INT. MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING/STREET -- NIGHT 104</p>
            <p> Through the window of the apartment, we can see Tracy and Mills<br>
              on the bed. CAMERA MOVES from this window, to the street.</p>
            <p> CAMERA CONTINUES down the night street, to a car far from Mills'<br>
              building. Inside the car, John Doe sits, looking up at Mills'<br>
              window. Doe looks as plain as white bread. He adjusts his thick<br>
              glasses, sips from a coffee cup.</p>
            <p>105 INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT 105</p>
            <p> Somerset is in bed. The metronome is sounding; tick... tick...<br>
              tick... The SOUNDS of the CITY are LOUD.</p>
            <p> Somerset closes his eyes, concentrating on the metronome.<br>
              Tick... tick... tick... TWO MEN are HEARD from outside, YELLING<br>
              at each other. Somerset rolls over, restless. Tick... tick...<br>
              tick...</p>
            <p> GLASS is HEARD SHATTERING. Somerset opens his eyes. MORE GLASS,<br>
              bottles being smashed. Somerset sits up. He reaches over, grabs<br>
              the metronome and throws it against the wall.</p>
            <p>106 INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- LATER NIGHT 106</p>
            <p> THWACK. Somerset's switchblade hits the dartboard on the wall<br>
              and the blade embeds.</p>
            <p> Somerset crosses the room, still dressed for bed. He is tense.<br>
              He takes the switchblade from the dartboard, paces back across<br>
              the room, turns, holds the blade, then throws. The blade sticks.</p>
            <p> Somerset paces back to the dartboard, pulls the blade, paces<br>
              back, throws the knife. THWACK. He goes to the board, gets the<br>
              blade, paces, turns, throws. THWACK.</p>
            <p> INSERT -- TITLE CARD</p>
            <p> SATURDAY</p>
            <p>107 INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- DAY 107</p>
            <p> A clock on the wall says 12:30.</p>
            <p>108 INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO -- DAY 108</p>
            <p> Three deputy detectives are reading John Doe's notebooks. PHONE<br>
              RINGS from the other room.</p>
            <p>109 INT. JOHN DOE'S APARMENT, MAIN ROOM -- DAY 109</p>
            <p> One deputy enters. He goes to the phone near the bed. The<br>
              phone's been hooked into recording device with a speaker and<br>
              tracing equipment. The deputy turns everything on, answers.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE (v.o.)<br>
              (through speaker)<br>
              I've gone and done it again.</p>
            <p>110 INT. LUXURY APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- DAY 110</p>
            <p> Somerset is looking around this femininely decorated bathroom<br>
              with a forensic, GIL. Both wear rubber gloves.</p>
            <p> At the sink, objects covered in blood: a pair of scissors, a<br>
              hypodermic needle, first-aid tape and gauze bandages, a bottle of<br>
              anesthetic, a straight razor and a tube of super glue.</p>
            <p> GIL<br>
              He really did a number on her, didn't he?</p>
            <p> Gil opens the plastic shower curtain and looks into the tub. The<br>
              tub and shower wall are splattered with blood. The tub has a few<br>
              inches of water in it. The water is cloudy red. A few bits of<br>
              tape and gauze float in it. Gil jiggles the drain's knob. Some<br>
              bubbles pop up from the clogged drain.</p>
            <p>111 INT. LUXURY APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- DAY 111</p>
            <p> PRIDE is written in lipstick on a full length mirror. Below<br>
              that: I DID NOT KILL HER. SHE WAS GIVEN A CHOICE.</p>
            <p> Mills and Dr. O'Neill are in the room. O'Neill goes through his<br>
              black bag. They're by a bed where a WOMAN lies dead under a<br>
              blanket. The woman's head is sloppily bandaged with heavy white<br>
              gauze and tape. The gauze is stained by spots of blood. Only<br>
              the eyes and mouth have been left uncovered. A zoo's worth of<br>
              stuffed animals have been placed across the bed. The woman holds<br>
              a stuffed unicorn.</p>
            <p> Somerset enters from the bathroom as Mills reaches to take the<br>
              unicorn from the woman's grasp. There is a cordless phone in her<br>
              left hand, and her and clings to it.</p>
            <p> Her right hand holds a bottle of prescription pills. Mills tries<br>
              to open the fingers of this hand with a tongue depressor, but<br>
              they are super-glued to the bottle. Mills turns the woman's hand<br>
              slightly so two red pills roll out onto the blanket.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Sleeping pills.</p>
            <p> Mills examines the left hand. The phone is glued into it.</p>
            <p> O'Neill steps up, holding a thin pair of silver scissors. He<br>
              leans to slide the scissors under the woman's bandage mask,<br>
              starts cutting.</p>
            <p> Somerset goes to a dresser where the woman's purse sits open. 
              He<br>
              takes out the driver's license and looks at the photo. The woman<br>
              in the picture is stunningly beautiful.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              You see what he did?</p>
            <p> Mills is watching the doctor work.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              He cut her up and dressed the wounds.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (holds up his left hand)<br>
              Call for help, and you'll live. But,<br>
              you'll be disfigured.<br>
              (raises right hand)<br>
              Or, put yourself out of your misery.</p>
            <p> O'Neill removes the bandages. Mills looks away. We do not see.<br>
              O'Neill looks to the detectives.</p>
            <p> O'NEILL<br>
              He cut off her nose to spite her face, and he did it very recently.</p>
            <p>112 EXT. CITY STREET -- DAY 112</p>
            <p> Mills' car pulls up in front of the precinct house. Mills and 
              Somerset get out. They wade through cars towards the old precinct 
              house building.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I've decided to stay on this, till it's over. Till it's either done 
              or we can both see it's never going to finish.</p>
            <p> Mills remains impassive.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Oh, you want to stay now?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              One of two things will happen. We're either going to get John Doe, 
              or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for 
              years.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days. You'd 
              be doing me the favor.</p>
            <p> Mills walks on.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You knew I'd say yes.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.</p>
            <p> Somerset and Mills climb the steps of the precinct house.<br>
              Behind them, in the street, John Doe's car pulls up and parks.</p>
            <p> Cars behind begin BEEPING. People behind begin cursing and<br>
              screaming for him to move.</p>
            <p> John Doe steps out, his brown work boots, pants and shirttails<br>
              are splattered with blood.</p>
            <p> He walks towards the precinct house, hands in his pockets, like<br>
              he's out for a stroll. People on the sidewalk stop on seeing<br>
              him, avoid him.</p>
            <p>113 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, RECEIVING LOBBY -- DAY 113</p>
            <p> Mills and Somerset walk past booking cubicles and benches of<br>
              handcuffed low-lifes. Junkies are being led through by uniformed<br>
              cops. The place is swimming with activity. The two detectives<br>
              head to the wide duty desk at the end of the room.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              As soon as this is over, I'm gone.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Big surprise.</p>
            <p> They pass through a gate and Somerset goes towards a staircase<br>
              leading upstairs. Mills stops at the duty desk. Other cops are<br>
              vying for the DUTY SERGEANT'S attention.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Mills and Somerset are on the premises.</p>
            <p> SERGEANT<br>
              Wonder-fucking-ful.</p>
            <p> Another PLAIN CLOTHES COP behind the duty desk leans over to hold 
              out a few phone-message note to Mills.</p>
            <p> PLAIN CLOTHES COP<br>
              Your wife called this morning. Do us a favor and get yourself an 
              answering machine, how bout it?</p>
            <p> Mills nods and wave dismissively, pocketing the messages without<br>
              looking at them and walking to follow Somerset.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE (o.s.)<br>
              Detective.</p>
            <p> Mills heads toward the stairs.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE (o.s.)<br>
              Detective!</p>
            <p> Mills looks back... stops.</p>
            <p> John Doe stands inside the precinct house doors. He gives a very<br>
              slight smile.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              I know you.</p>
            <p> Somerset stops, looks back down the stairs.</p>
            <p> Mills is staring at Doe, not comprehending.</p>
            <p> Doe holds up his arms as if to say, &quot;Presto, here I am.&quot; 
              All<br>
              eyes go to the blood-soaked figure of John Doe. There comes a<br>
              sudden, near-silence in the room.</p>
            <p> One UNIFORMED COP takes out his gun, points it at John Doe.</p>
            <p> UNIFORMED COP<br>
              It's him!</p>
            <p> Several other cops drop what they're doing and draw weapons.</p>
            <p> Mills, still off balance, takes out his own gun, walking back 
              through the gate. He points the gun at John Doe.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Get down. Get down on the floor.</p>
            <p> Cops move slowly in on Doe from all sides.</p>
            <p> ANOTHER COP<br>
              You heard him, fuckface. Get down!</p>
            <p> Somerset comes back through the gate.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Be careful!</p>
            <p> John Doe gets down on his knees, hands in the air. Mills, pulse<br>
              pounding, steps up, gun in both hands. Not too close.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Down! Face on the floor!</p>
            <p> ONE COP comes from behind and nudges Doe with his foot.</p>
            <p> ONE COP<br>
              Spread your legs and get your hands out in front of you!</p>
            <p> John Doe lies on his stomach, obeying. Mills comes up and puts<br>
              his gun right against Doe's head.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Don't move. Don't move an inch.</p>
            <p> One cop begins frisking Doe. Another comes to put on cuffs.</p>
            <p> Somerset comes to Mills' side.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I don't believe it.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              (to Somerset)<br>
              Hello.</p>
            <p> The cop putting on the handcuffs looks up at Somerset and Mills.</p>
            <p> COP<br>
              What the fuck is this... ?</p>
            <p> The cop holds up Doe's cuffed hands. Doe winces. Every single<br>
              one of Doe's fingers has a bandage wrapped around it.</p>
            <p> John Doe tries to muster a smile, his face pressed against the<br>
              floor, glasses askew, gun at his temple.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE<br>
              (to Mills)<br>
              I want to speak to my lawyer.</p>

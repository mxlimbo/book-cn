              67 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- DAY 67</p>
            <p> A blackboard is nailed to the wall. Written in chalk:</p>
            <p> 1 gluttony (x) 5 wrath<br>
              2 greed (x) 6 pride<br>
              3 sloth (x) 7 lust<br>
              4 envy</p>
            <p> Somerset and Mills are at their paperwork covered desks.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              ((reading one sheet)<br>
              Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox 
              each month. He says, quote, &quot;I never heard a single complaint 
              from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained<br>
              about him. He's the best tenant I've ever had.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Who pays the rent on time.</p>
            <p> Somerset turns to the typewriter, types. Mills fills out a form 
              by hand. He make an error and tries to erase, but the paper rips. 
              He curses, crumples the paper and throws it.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              This is the job. It's not an Easter egg hunt.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow. I 
              mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic.<br>
              We can't make that mistake.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Oh, blah, blah, blah. The guy's insane.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              It's a fine line between insane and inspired.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh? Right 
              now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's 
              panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              No. He's not depending on luck. You've seen that. We walked into 
              that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the 
              bed, to the day. To the day!<br>
              Because he wanted us to.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              We don't know for sure...</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Yes we do. Here...</p>
            <p> Somerset picks up the photocopy of the first note.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              This quote... his first words to us. I looked it up. It's from Milton's 
              Paradise Lost. &quot;Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell 
              leads up to light... &quot;</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              And so what?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him 
              Einstein.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic. The type of intestinal 
              fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year. To 
              connect tubes to his genitals. To sever his hand and use it to plant 
              fingerprints. He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's 
              patient.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What does all that matter anyway? It's not our job to figure him 
              out, is it? All we have to do is catching him.</p>
            <p> Something clicks for Somerset. He looks away, thinking.</p>
            <p> Mills watches him.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> Somerset sits. Ponders, staring off into space.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What is it?</p>
            <p> Somerset stands back up, takes money out of his pockets.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              How much money do you have?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I don't know... like fifty.</p>
            <p> Somerset picks up the phone and dials, still sifting through his<br>
              own money. Mills doesn't know what's going on.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (to Mills)<br>
              I propose a field trip.</p>
            <p>68 INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY -- DAY 68</p>
            <p> Somerset walks through the busy main library, goes to a group 
              of<br>
              computer terminals. Mills follows, wound up. Somerset sits at<br>
              one computer and works the keyboard, hunt-and-peck.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Somerset... what the fuck?</p>
            <p> Several people turn to shush him. Somerset takes out a notepad.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              At the top of the list, we'll put Purgatory, Canterbury Tales... 
              anything<br>
              relating to the seven deadly sins. Now, what the killer might research. 
              What would he need to study to do the things he's done? What are 
              his other interests? For example...</p>
            <p> INSERT -- COMPUTER SCREEN</p>
            <p> Somerset types. On the screen: SEARCH: JACK THE RIPPER.</p>
            <p>69 EXT. HOT DOG WORLD -- DAY 69</p>
            <p> The restaurant's sign reads: HOT DOG WORLD, HOME OF THE WORLD'S 
              BIGGEST DOGS. A MAN is trying to give out paper dvertisements.<br>
              People walk out of their way to avoid him.</p>
            <p> MAN<br>
              (to people)<br>
              Take one, you stupid fucks! Here... take one! It's a fucking coupon! 
              Take it!</p>
            <p>70 INT. HOT DOG WORLD -- DAY 70</p>
            <p> Mills and Somerset are in a booth, both on the same seat on the<br>
              same side of the table. They look over their list of books.<br>
              Mills goes to eat a hot dog, but Somerset stops him.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              They had about fifty health violations during the last inspection.</p>
            <p> Mills throws the dog down, looks at his watch.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Could you at least sit across from me? I<br>
              don't want people to thing we're dating.</p>
            <p> Somerset watches a GREASY MAN, wearing a black suit, enter. The<br>
              man's hair is slicked back.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Give me your money.</p>
            <p> Mills hands his money to Somerset.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I'm handing you this, and for some strange reason, I have the idea 
              I should know what the fuck we're doing.</p>
            <p> Somerset folds the money with his own into the list of books. 
              He<br>
              holds the list in his lap, under the table. Greasy Man comes to<br>
              sit at the table.</p>
            <p> GREASY MAN<br>
              Hey, Somerset. How are you? I didn't know this was going to be a 
              menage-a-trois.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              It's not a problem.</p>
            <p> GREASY MAN<br>
              Only for you do I do this. Big risk here... so I figure we'll be 
              even-up. All fair and square.</p>
            <p> Greasy Man has his hands under the table. he gets up to leave<br>
              with his hand in his pocket. He picks up Mills' dog.</p>
            <p> GREASY MAN<br>
              About an hour.</p>
            <p> Greasy Man leaves, eating the hot dog.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Well, that was money well spent.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Let's go.</p>
            <p>71 INT. PIZZA PARLOR -- DAY 71</p>
            <p> Mills and Somerset sit with a pizza before them.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch 
              you in the face.</p>
            <p> Somerset leans closer to Mills, speaks quietly.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth. 
              The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Him?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, 
              keeping accurate records.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What? Assessing fines?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              They monitor reading habits. Not every book, but certain ones are 
              flagged. Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, 
              or maybe Mein Kampf. Whoever takes out a flagged book has their 
              library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You got to be kidding.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... 
              communism to violent crime.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              How is this legal?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Legal... illegal. These terms don't apply.<br>
              I don't applaud it.</p>
            <p> Somerset takes a bite of pizza.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              They can't use the information directly, but it's a useful guide. 
              It might sound silly, but you can't get a library card without i.d. 
              and a current phone bill.</p>
            <p> Mills is starting to warm to it.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              So they ran our list.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, 
              and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer 
              will tell you. It might give us a name.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Yeah. Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens 
              to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office. We've got pizza.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              How do you know all about this?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I don't. Neither do you.</p>
            <p> Somerset looks up. Greasy Man is entering the pizza parlor.</p>

              31 INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY, MAIN LIBRARY -- NIGHT 31</p>
            <p> MUSIC CONTINUES. Somerset has two books open. He opens his<br>
              notebook and brings a pen to bear. Writes:</p>
            <p> SEVEN DEADLY SINS</p>
            <p> GLUTTONY GREED WRATH LUST PRIDE ENVY SLOTH</p>
            <p> He crosses out GLUTTONY and GREED. Somerset picks up one book:<br>
              DANTE'S PURGATORY. Volume II of the DIVINE COMEDY. Somerset<br>
              opens it:</p>
            <p> <br>
              | THE EARTHLY PARADISE<br>
              | VII The Lustful <br>
              | VI The Gluttonous 7 TERRACES OF<br>
              | V The Avaricious and Prodigal PURGATION<br>
              | IV The Slothful<br>
              | III The Wrathful<br>
              | II The Envious<br>
              | I The Proud<br>
              THE ISLAND OF PURGATORY</p>
            <p> UP ON THE BALCONY</p>
            <p> George and the guys finish another hand. George looks down at 
              Somerset, who is writing in the notebook. George takes up the cards 
              and starts shuffling.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              (down to Somerset)<br>
              You know, Smilely... you're really going to miss us.</p>
            <p> George shuffles again, but they flip wrong and a few go off the 
              table, over the balcony.</p>
            <p> DOWN ON THE MAIN FLOOR</p>
            <p> Somerset looks up at George, then looks around.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I just might.</p>
            <p> ABOVE</p>
            <p> The cards George dropped are fluttering, flipping downwards.</p>
            <p>32 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING 32</p>
            <p> The office is dark. Somerset is at his desk, writing:</p>
            <p> DETECTIVE MILLS, YOU MAY WANT TO LOOK AT THE FOLLOWING BOOKS, 
              RELATING TO THE _SEVEN_DEADLY_SINS_:</p>
            <p> DANTE'S PURGATORY <br>
              THE CANTERBURY TALES -- THE PARSON'S TALE DICTIONARY OF CATHOLICISM</p>
            <p>33 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- LATER EVENING 33</p>
            <p> Somerset lays an envelope on top of the two boxes which have Detective 
              Mills' name on them. The envelope reads: MILLS.</p>
            <p> INSERT -- TITLE CARD</p>
            <p> WEDNESDAY</p>
            <p>34 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- MORNING 34</p>
            <p> Somerset pushes the door open and notices &quot;DETECTIVE MILLS&quot; 
              painted on the glass. Rain falls outside. Somerset goes to his desk, 
              but stops. All his belongings have been moved to a small, temporary 
              desk in the corner.</p>
            <p> Somerset moves to open the top left drawer of the big desk.<br>
              Empty. He goes to the temporary desk and urgently searches through 
              the boxes of papers and files... finds what he was looking for. 
              He holds a small frame which fits in his palm.</p>
            <p> Inside the frame is a PHOTO of an attractive WOMAN. Somerset pops 
              the frame open, looks at the picture, then puts the picture in his 
              wallet.</p>
            <p> Somerset sits at the temporary desk. He begins to sort through 
              his papers. After a moment, he glances over his shoulder. The envelope 
              he left for Mills is gone.</p>
            <p>35 EXT. UPSCALE CITY BLOCK -- MORNING 35</p>
            <p> It's raining. At one high-rent office building, many business 
              men and women are coming and going in a lunch-hour hurry. Just to 
              one side of the building, the CORONER'S WAGON drives out from the 
              mouth of the parking garage into the rain. People on the sidewalk 
              have to stop to let it cross to the street. At the same<br>
              time, a large Lincoln Towncar turns off the street, heads into the 
              bowels of the garage.</p>
            <p>36 EXT. UPSCALE BUILDING, UNDERGROUND GARAGE -- MORNING 36</p>
            <p> Many police cars and news vans here, and police men and reporters 
              and photographers everywhere. Mills, looking haggard, finishes a 
              conversation with a TALL COP by the service elevator.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              ... good. Do it. I'm going back up.</p>
            <p> Tall Cop hurries away as Mills pushes repeatedly on the service 
              elevator button. The elevator doors open and Mills steps in. As 
              the door are shutting, a COMMOTION is HEARD. Mills stops the door 
              and looks out.</p>
            <p> Across the garage, the Towncar is pulling to a stop and reporters 
              are rushing to it. FLASHBULBS are FLASHING.</p>
            <p> MARTIN TALBOT, 47, impressive and well dressed, steps out of the 
              car and faces the reporters as they start shouting questions.</p>
            <p> In the service elevator, Mills lets the doors slide shut.</p>
            <p>37 INT. UPSCALE BUILDING, SERVICE AREA -- MORNING 37</p>
            <p> The service elevator opens to a dark physical plant room. Mills 
              exits the elevator and crosses past humming air-conditioning vents, 
              dripping pipes and janitor's lockers. To a door...</p>
            <p>38 INT. UPSCALE BUILDING, OFFICE CORRIDOR -- MORNING 38</p>
            <p> Mills comes out the service area door into a bright, ritzy hallway. 
              This hall and the doors along it reek of money. A few cops are standing 
              around. Ahead there's a police line, which Mills ducks under on 
              his way to stately mahogany doors.</p>
            <p>39 INT. LAW OFFICE -- MORNING 39</p>
            <p> A huge law office. A television is on in one corner, showing the 
              news. Windows overlook the rain wet city. Two FORENSICS dust for 
              prints, whispering to each other when Mills enters.</p>
            <p> FORENSIC ONE<br>
              (to other forensic)<br>
              ... going to screw it up. I swear... I've seen...</p>
            <p> The other forensic clears his throat, getting back to work.<br>
              Forensic One shuts up. Mills notices this, weary.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              How's it coming?</p>
            <p> FORENSIC ONE<br>
              Nothing yet.</p>
            <p> Mills watches them a moment, then turns his attention to another 
              part of the office. A leather chair sits in an open area.</p>
            <p> The chair and the carpet under it are covered in a goodly portion 
              of brown, dried blood.</p>
            <p> There is a trail of dripped blood from the chair to a large desk.<br>
              On a cleared off section of the desk, a two-armed, counter balance 
              SCALE sits, also blood stained. The desk has been dusted. Behind 
              the desk, GREED is written on the wall in blood, near a modern art 
              painting.</p>
            <p> Mills stands staring at this area. The TELEVISION is HEARD:</p>
            <p> ANCHOR (v.o.)<br>
              (from television)<br>
              ... going cut in live downtown right now, where Defense Attorney 
              Eli Gould was found murdered in his office late last night.<br>
              District Attorney Martin Talbot is taking questions from reporters...</p>
            <p>40 ON T.V., Talbot comes on screen, a powerful presence, with a 
              gold 40<br>
              tooth in the front of his mouth. It's from down in the garage.</p>
            <p> A REPORTER (v.o.)<br>
              (from television)<br>
              ... a small conflict of interest here? I mean, your prosecutors 
              have lost more than<br>
              a few very high profile cases to Mister Gould and his defense team...</p>
            <p> TALBOT (v.o.)<br>
              (from television)<br>
              Now, that's ridiculous to the point of almost being offensive. There's 
              no conflict of interest whatsoever, and any claim that there would 
              be, or could be, is<br>
              irresponsible.</p>
            <p> Other reporters begin to shout questions, but Talbot's not done.</p>
            <p> TALBOT (v.o.)<br>
              Now, hold on... I want to address that. I've just come from a meeting 
              with law<br>
              enforcement officials, and they've assured me they put their best 
              people on this<br>
              thing.</p>
            <p> Mills turns to looks at Talbot on the screen.</p>
            <p> TALBOT (v.o.)<br>
              You just wait and see how quickly we get a handle on it. This will 
              be the very<br>
              definition of swift justice.</p>
            <p> Mills walks to turn the t.v. off.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (quietly to t.v.)<br>
              Shut the fuck up.</p>
            <p> He turns and looks to see the forensics looking at him. The forensics 
              look away.</p>
            <p> Mills walks away from the t.v., to a picture frame on the floor.<br>
              The frame has been placed specifically in the center of the room, 
              facing the doors.</p>
            <p> It is a photo if a falsely pretty, middle-aged woman, smiling 
              and wearing pearls. On the glass of the frame, two circles have 
              been drawn with blood around the woman's eyes.</p>
            <p> Mills sits on the floor, stares at the photo.</p>
            <p>41 INT. MILLS' CAR -- MORNING 41</p>
            <p> Mills gets in and slams the door. He is alone with the sound of 
              the rain. He wipes water from his face and looks at his tired eyes 
              in the rear view mirror. He leans over to the glove compartment 
              and takes out two newly purchased paperbacks: The Canterbury Tales 
              and Dante's Purgatory.</p>
            <p> Mills makes a face and opens Dante's Purgatory to a bookmark. 
              He rests the book on the steering wheel. He reads.</p>
            <p> He bites his lip, leaning close to the words.</p>
            <p> He is really concentrating, mouths some of the words to himself. 
              He finally shakes his head and closes the book, not understanding 
              a word of it. Pause. He starts pounding the book against the steering 
              wheel with all his might.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Fucking, Dante, goddamn, poetry-writing, faggot motherfucker...</p>
            <p> Mills throws the book against the windshield, then puts his head 
              back and closes his eyes, trying to calm. A long moment. Quiet. 
              BANG, BANG, BANG -- there's a loud BANGING on the window and Mills 
              looks up, startled...</p>
            <p> Tall Cop is at the window in rain gear. Mills rolls it rown.<br>
              Tall Cop hands a wet paper bag through.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Good work, Officer. Good work.</p>
            <p> Mills rolls the window up, rips the bag open. Inside: Cliff<br>
              Notes for Dante's Purgatory and for The Canterbury Tales.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Thank God.</p>
            <p>42 INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- DAY 42</p>
            <p> It still rains outside. Somerset sits at the big desk which is 
              now Mills'. He fills out form by hand as Mills enters with a ton 
              of his own paperwork. Somerset looks up.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (gathers his things)<br>
              Let me get out of your way.</p>
            <p> Mills sets his paperwork on the desk. He is beat. Somerset moves 
              to the temporary desk. They both sit and settle in, organizing, 
              not looking at each other.</p>
            <p> Both attend to their work. Here are two men, about five feet apart, 
              each trying not to acknowledge the other's presence.<br>
              Mills takes his Cliff Notes out, looks to see Somerset is occupied, 
              and hides them in a desk drawer.</p>
            <p> Somerset finishes one form, flips it and looks at Mills. Mills 
              sorts through photos from the greed murder. Somerset continues writing. 
              PHONE RINGS. Both men look at it. Phone rings again.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              It's a package deal. You get the phone with the office.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (picks up, into phone)<br>
              Detective Mills here.<br>
              (listens, lowers voice)<br>
              Honey... I asked you not to call me here.<br>
              I'll call you back...<br>
              (listens)<br>
              What? Why?</p>
            <p> Mills is very confused.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Why? Okay... okay, hold on.</p>
            <p> Mills clears his throat and holds out the phone to Somerset.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              It's my wife.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> Mills shrugs. Somerset stands, takes the phone.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Hello?<br>
              (listens)<br>
              Yes, well... it's nice to speak to you.<br>
              (listens)<br>
              Well, I appreciate the thought... but...<br>
              (listens)<br>
              Then, I guess I'd be delighted. Thank you<br>
              very much. Yes... goodbye.</p>
            <p> Somerset hangs up, shakes his head.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Well?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I'm invited to have a late supper at your house. And, I accept.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              How's that?</p>

              89 INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO -- NIGHT 89</p>
            <p> Somerset and three uniformed officers are looking through the<br>
              notebooks on the shelves. Somerset squints at the notebook in<br>
              his hand, shaking his head as he reads. Mills enters.</p>
            <p> Somerset looks up and closes the notebook.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              We could use about fifty more men here.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I'm trying, alright? Just tell me what we've got.</p>
            <p> Somerset pauses briefly at Mills' abruptness.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and 
              near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty 
              pages.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Then, he must write about these murders.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (opens notebook, reads)<br>
              &quot;What sick, ridiculous, puppets we are, and what a gross, little 
              stage we dance on.<br>
              What fun we have, dancing and fucking, not a care in the world. 
              Not knowing that we are nothing. We are not what was intended.&quot;</p>
            <p> Somerset turns a few pages.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (reads)<br>
              &quot;On the subway today, a man came to me to start a conversation. 
              He made small talk, this lonely man, talking about the weather and 
              other things. I tried to be pleasant and accommodating, but my head 
              began to hurt from his banality. I almost didn't notice it had happened, 
              but I suddenly threw up all over him. He was not pleased, and I 
              couldn't help laughing.&quot;</p>
            <p> Somerset closes the notebook.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order. 
              It's just his mind poured out on paper. I don't think it's going 
              to give us any specifics.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's 
              work.</p>
            <p> A PHONE is HEARD RINGING in another room. Mills looks.</p>
            <p>90 INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT 90</p>
            <p> Everyone's looking around, and at each other, trying to find the<br>
              source of the RINGING. Mills and Somerset enter, baffled. Mills<br>
              looks to Sara. She shrugs and shakes her head.</p>
            <p> Everyone searches. PHONE RINGS.</p>
            <p> Mills gets on his hands and knees.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Here...</p>
            <p> Mills crawls under John Doe's &quot;bed.&quot; He comes back out 
              with a<br>
              rotary phone. Someone throws him a micro-cassette recorder.<br>
              Mills turns the recorder on, makes sure it's running, then picks<br>
              up the phone with the recorder to the earpiece.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Hello.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE (v.o.)<br>
              (from phone)<br>
              I admire you. I don't know how you found me, but imagine my surprise. 
              I respect you detectives more every day.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Okay, John, let's...</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE (v.o.)<br>
              (from phone)<br>
              No, no, no! You listen. I'll be back on schedule tomorrow, even 
              with this setback.<br>
              I just had to call and express my admiration. I'm sorry I had to 
              hurt you today, but I didn't have a choice. You will accept my apology, 
              won't you?</p>
            <p> Mills says nothing, containing his anger.</p>
            <p> JOHN DOE (v.o.)<br>
              I feel like saying more... but I don't want to ruin the surprise.</p>
            <p> John Doe hangs up. Mills puts down the phone.</p>
            <p>91 INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO -- LATER NIGHT 91</p>
            <p> Mills and Somerset stand in the dark, watching the continuous<br>
              loop projector's strange images of Heaven and Hell.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              You were right.</p>
            <p> Somerset looks at Mills.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              He's preaching.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (nods)<br>
              These murders are his masterwork. His sermon to all of us. To all 
              us sinners.</p>
            <p> The door opens and light bursts in. The captain stands there,<br>
              looking them over.</p>
            <p> CAPTAIN<br>
              It's been a long day, kids. Go home. Just make sure you sleep with 
              the phone between your legs.</p>
            <p>92 INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT 92</p>
            <p> Somerset winds his metronome. PHONE RINGS. Somerset does not<br>
              want to answer it, but does.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Hello.</p>
            <p> TRACY (v.o.)<br>
              (from phone)<br>
              Hello, William? It's Tracy.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Tracy, is everything alright?</p>
            <p> TRACY (v.o.)<br>
              Yes, yes, everything's fine.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Where's David?</p>
            <p> TRACY (v.o.)<br>
              He's in the shower, in the other room. I'm sorry to call like this.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              It's alright, I guess.</p>
            <p> TRACY (v.o.)<br>
              I, um... I need to talk to you. I need to talk to someone. Can you 
              meet me somewhere... maybe tomorrow morning?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I really don't understand.</p>
            <p> TRACY (v.o.)<br>
              I feel stupid, but you're the only person I know here. There's no 
              one else...</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I just...</p>
            <p> TRACY (v.o.)<br>
              Can't you get away, for a little while?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I don't know, with this case.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              If you can, please call me. Please. I<br>
              have to go now... goodnight.</p>
            <p> Tracy hangs up. Somerset looks at the phone, wondering.</p>
            <p> INSERT -- TITLE CARD</p>
            <p> FRIDAY</p>
            <p>93 INT. COFFEE CAFE -- MORNING 93</p>
            <p> Somerset sits in the window booth with Tracy. The cafe is noisy.<br>
              Tracy stares into her coffee while she stirs it.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              I mean, you known this city. You've been here for so long.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              It's a hard place.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              I don't sleep very well.</p>
            <p> Somerset is trying to be understanding, but sneaks a look at his<br>
              watch.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I feel strange being here with you...<br>
              without David knowing.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              I'm sorry, I only...</p>
            <p> Two young punks step up to the window outside and look in at<br>
              Tracy. One flicks his tongue rapidly. Tracy looks away.<br>
              Somerset takes out his badge and holds it against the window.<br>
              One punk gives the finger and the other spits on the window.<br>
              They leave, laughing. Tracy tries to smile.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              Perfect example.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              You have to put blinders on sometimes.<br>
              Most times.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              I don't know why I asked you to come.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Talk to him about it. He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              I can't be a burden, especially now. I know I'll get used to things. 
              I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks. Upstate, 
              it was a completely different environment.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              He mentioned it.</p>
            <p> Tracy seemsvery upset, near tears.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the 
              conditions here are... horrible.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              You should look into private schools.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              I don't know...</p>
            <p> Tracy looks up, wipes at her eyes.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              What's really bothering you?</p>
            <p> Tracy bites her lip.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              David and I are... going to have a baby.</p>
            <p> Somerset sits back, the expression of soothing concern on his<br>
              face disappearing.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about 
              this.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              I hate this city.</p>
            <p> Somerset sighs. He takes out a cigarette, but thinks better of 
              it and puts it back. He looks out the window.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              If you're thinking...<br>
              (pause)<br>
              I had a relationship once, very much like a marriage. And, she was 
              going to have our child. This is a long time ago. She and I had 
              decided we were going to make the choice together... whether to 
              keep the baby.</p>
            <p> Tracy looks at Somerset.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other 
              day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby.<br>
              And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me. I looked 
              around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all 
              this? How can a child grow up here?<br>
              (pause)<br>
              So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over 
              the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong. I mean... I wore 
              her down, slowly.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              I want to have children. It's just...</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision. 
              I'm positive.<br>
              But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided 
              differently.</p>
            <p> Somerset reaches and takes Tracy's hand.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              If you... don't keep the baby, if that's what you decide, then, 
              never tell him you were pregnant. I mean that. Never.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              The relationship will whither and die.</p>
            <p> Tracy nods, tears welling up again. Somerset smiles a bit.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              But, if you do decide to have the baby, then, at that very moment, 
              when you're absolutely sure, tell David. Tell him at that exact 
              second, and then spoil that kid every chance you get.</p>
            <p> There are tears in Somerset's eyes.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              That's all the advice I can give you, Tracy. I don't even know you.</p>
            <p> He smiles again, wipes his own tears.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              William...</p>
            <p> Somerset's beeper begins BEEPING. He takes it out and stands,<br>
              wanting to leave. Tracy gets up and kisses him on the cheek.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> Somerset starts to back away.</p>
            <p> TRACY<br>
              Keep in touch after you're gone, William.<br>
              Please.</p>
            <p> Somerset nods, raises a hand to say goodbye as he leaves.</p>

              <br>
              46 INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM 46</p>
            <p> The only sounds are from the city outside. The living room table<br>
              has been cleared and its surface is now covered with various<br>
              forms, reports and 8&quot; by 10&quot; photographs. Mills and Somerset 
              are<br>
              both standing. Mills guides Somerset through the photos.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and 
              security tightened up. Gould must have been working late.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              I'm certain. He was the biggest defense lawyer around. Infamous, 
              actually.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Well, his body was found Monday night, okay? But, get this... the 
              office was closed all day Monday. Which means, as long as the gluttony 
              killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've<br>
              gotten in here on Friday. He could've spent all day Saturday with 
              Gould, and all day Sunday.</p>
            <p> Mills picks up one photo and shows it to Somerset. Long shot: 
              it<br>
              shows the greed murder scene. Gould sits dead in the leather<br>
              chair, near the desk where the counter-balance scale sits.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Gould was tied down, nude. The killer left his arms free and handed 
              him a big, sharp butcher's knife. See... the scale here.</p>
            <p> Mills pulls another photo. Close up: the two-armed scale. In one 
              suspended plate is a one pound weight. In the other is a hunk of 
              flesh.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              A pound of flesh.</p>
            <p> Mills digs, comes up with a photocopy of a hand-scrawled note.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (reading note)<br>
              &quot;One pound of flesh, no more no less. No cartilage, no bone, 
              but only flesh. This task done... and he would go free.&quot;</p>
            <p> Mills takes out one photo showing the note pinned to the wall 
              beside where &quot;greed&quot; is written in blood.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (nods, grim)<br>
              All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              The murderer would want Gould to take his time. To have to sit there 
              and decide.<br>
              Where do you make the first cut? There's a gun in your face... but, 
              what part of your body is expendable?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              He cut along the side of his stomach. The love handle.</p>
            <p> Somerset's still studying the photos.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              He must have left another puzzle piece.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              This is just to satisfy my curiosity. I'm still leaving town Saturday.</p>
            <p> Mills is very tired. He rubs his eyes, then walks to take one 
              more photo from his briefcase. It is the photo of the framed picture 
              of the falsely pretty woman with her eyes circled in blood.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Gould's wife. She was away on business.<br>
              If this means she saw anything, I don't know what. We've questioned 
              her at least five times.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              And, if it's a threat.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              We put her in a safe house.</p>
            <p> Somerset nods. He puts down the photos he's holding. He begins<br>
              spreading all the pictures out.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Look at these with fresh eyes. Don't see what the killer wants you 
              to. Don't let guide you...</p>
            <p> While he speaks, Somerset keeps shifting the photos, for example:<br>
              covering the corpse in one with the edge of another.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Even if the corpse is right there... it's almost like looking through 
              it. Editing out the initial shock. Look at the room.</p>
            <p> In the photos, there's the scale. The note on the wall. Shelves 
              of books. The Modern Art painting.</p>
            <p> GREED written in blood.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              He's preaching.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Punishing.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              The sins were used in medieval sermons.<br>
              There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created 
              as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Did you read them?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Yeah. Parts of them. Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are 
              climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who 
              sinned...</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Seven Terraces of Purgation.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Right. But there, pride comes first, not gluttony. The sins are 
              in a different order.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration.<br>
              (MORE)</p>
            <p> SOMERSET (cont'd)<br>
              The books and sermons are about atonement for sin. And, these murders 
              have been like forced attrition.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Forced what?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Attrition. When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.</p>
            <p> Mills runs his hands across his face, walks to the fridge to get 
              beer. Somerset keeps looking at photos and papers.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              No fingerprints?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Nothing.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Totally unrelated victims.</p>
            <p> Mills nods, drinking from a beer.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              No witnesses of any kind?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              None. Which I don't understand. He had to get back out.</p>
            <p> Somerset sits in a chair, picks up the photo of the wife. Runs 
              his fingers over the eyes circled in blood.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              In any major city, minding your own business is a perfected science. 
              There's a public crime prevention course offered at the precinct 
              house once a month. The first thing they teach is that you should 
              never cry &quot;help.&quot; Always scream &quot;fire,&quot; because 
              people don't want to get caught up in anything. But a fire... that's 
              an evening's ntertainment. They come running.</p>
            <p> Looking at the wife's photo.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              This is the one thing.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I know.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              (holds photo up)<br>
              What if it's not that she's SEEN<br>
              something? What if she's supposed to see something, but she just 
              hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Okay. But, what?</p>
            <p>47 INT. SAFE HOUSE -- NIGHT 47</p>
            <p> The room is like a hotel room. Mills stands beside the woman<br>
              from the picture, MRS. GOULD. Mills shows her photos from the<br>
              murder scene. The photos have been covered in sections to hide<br>
              the Mr. Gould's corpse. Mrs. Gould is crying. Somerset is on<br>
              the other side of the room, holding more photos.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould. I really<br>
              am.</p>
            <p> MRS GOULD<br>
              I... I don't understand.</p>
            <p> Mills helps her flip through the photos. He isn't too keen to 
              put her through this.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              I need you to look at each one carefully...<br>
              very carefully. Look for anything that seems strange or out of place. 
              Anything at all.</p>
            <p> MRS GOULD<br>
              I don't know why... why now?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Please, I need you to help me if we're going to get who did this.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Gould sobs quietly, wipes her tears.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Anything... anything missing or different.</p>
            <p> MRS GOULD<br>
              I don't see anything.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Are you absolutely certain?</p>
            <p> MRS GOULD<br>
              I can't do this now... please.</p>
            <p> Mills looks to Somerset, looks at the photos Somerset holds.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Maybe we better wait.</p>
            <p> Somerset looks at the photos in his hand. These show Mr. Gould's<br>
              corpse in the chair, not covered in any way.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              It should be now. There may be something we're not seeing.</p>
            <p> MRS GOULD<br>
              Wait. Here...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What is it?</p>
            <p> Mrs. Gould points at the modern art painting on the wall in one<br>
              photo. The painting is just splattered paint, abstract.</p>
            <p> MRS GOULD<br>
              This painting...</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> MRS GOULD<br>
              Why is this painting hanging upside-down?</p>
            <p> Mills turns to look at Somerset.</p>
            <p>48 INT. LAW OFFICE -- NIGHT 48</p>
            <p> Where the greed murder took place. Somerset, wearing gloves,<br>
              reaches to take the modern art painting off the wall. Mills near, 
              watching.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              You're sure your men didn't move this?</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.</p>
            <p> Nothing on the wall behind the painting. Blank space.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Nothing.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              It's got to be.</p>
            <p> Somerset puts the painting down, resting it on its bottom edge.<br>
              The painting is backed by a thick sheet of brown papers stapled<br>
              into the wooden frame. Somerset points to where the wire's eye<br>
              screws used to be screwed into the frame, and to where it has<br>
              been rescrewed.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              He changed the wire to rehang it.</p>
            <p> Somerset takes out his switchblade. Mills is surprised.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What the fuck is that?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              A switchblade.</p>
            <p> Somerset cuts along the edge of the brown paper to get to the<br>
              hollow space between it and the back of the canvas. He cuts out<br>
              the entire sheet. Mills helps pull it away. Nothing. Empty.<br>
              Mills looks at both sides of the paper, then tosses it away.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Nothing. Damn it!</p>
            <p> Somerset lays the painting face up on the floor. He pokes his<br>
              finger on the painted surface. He brings the flat of his blade<br>
              against the painting, tries to peel some of the paint.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              The killer didn't paint the fucking thing.<br>
              Give it up.</p>
            <p> Somerset pushes the painting away, frustrated.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              There must be something.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              We're screwed. He's fucking with us.</p>
            <p> Somerset backs away from the wall, staring at the space where 
              the<br>
              painting hung. There is only a nail. He turns, looking around<br>
              the office, then crosses.</p>
            <p> Mills puts his hands to his temple, furious, picks up a lamp and<br>
              throws it to the floor, venting.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Motherfucker!</p>
            <p> Across the room, Somerset falls to his knees and pulls open a<br>
              forensics kit. He takes out a fingerprint brush, examining the<br>
              bristles. Mills sees this.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Bear with me.</p>
            <p> Somerset goes back to the wall where the painting was. He pulls<br>
              over a chair, gets on it and starts brushing near the nail.</p>
            <p> MILLS<br>
              Oh, yeah, sure. You got to be kidding?!</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Just wait!</p>
            <p> Somerset brushes with a few wider strokes. He leans close,<br>
              studies the powder residue. Leans closer still. Pause.</p>
            <p> SOMERSET<br>
              Call the print lab.</p>
            <p>49 INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT 49</p>
            <p> Tracy is asleep, dressed, with the lights still on. She stirs,<br>
              then awakens and sits up slowly. She squints from the light,<br>
              sweaty and uncomfortable. She looks around and listens. All she<br>
              hears is traffic.</p>
            <p>50 EXT. MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 50</p>
            <p> FROM OUTSIDE, looking into the apartment, we see Tracy come in<br>
              from the bedroom. She sees Mills and Somerset are gone. She<br>
              comes to open a window, then goes to the kitchen area.</p>
            <p> We're still LOOKING IN at her as she starts the dishes in the<br>
              sink. The RUMBLING of the SUBWAY TRAIN is HEARD starting. The<br>
              room begins to rattle, as before.</p>
            <p> Tracy looks out into the living room, ill at ease.</p>

              INT. FERRARI - MOVING - NIGHT</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Nice car. Yours?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (as he grinds the gears; wincing)<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Stolen?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Not exactly.</p>
            <p> He smiles. Vivian smiles back.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Mind if I turn on some heat?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              If you can figure it out, be my<br>
              guest.</p>
            <p> Vivian reaches out, turns on the heat.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Very good. You're obviously<br>
              mechanical.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (laughs)<br>
              You're not from L.A., huh?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              New York.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What motel you staying at?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Hotel.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Okay, what hotel?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Regent Beverly Wilshire. I bet<br>
              you know it.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (annoyed at his tone)<br>
              Yeah, I peed in the fountain there<br>
              once. Give me a break.</p>
            <p> Edward glances over, amused. It hits him that she really is an 
              attractive girl.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              What's your name?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What do you want it to be?<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              Vivian, my name's Vivian.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              You like being a hooker, Vivian?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              It pays.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              So do day jobs.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (sarcastic)<br>
              Day jobs, yeah. I've tried them.<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              Turn right.</p>
            <p> EXT. SANTA MONICA BLVD. - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The Ferrari glides along a seedy, West Hollywood section of<br>
              Santa Monica.</p>
            <p> INT. FERRARI - MOVING - NIGHT</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Must be dangerous. Hooking.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Tell me about it. L.A. is<br>
              suffering from a wacko epidemic.<br>
              And who knows where half the guys<br>
              I pick up have been. I mean, I<br>
              use condoms. Always. And I get<br>
              checked out once a month at the<br>
              free clinic. Not only am I better<br>
              in the sack than an amateur, I'm<br>
              probably safer.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Very good. You ought to have<br>
              that printed up on your business<br>
              card.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (a moment)<br>
              If you're making fun of me, I<br>
              don't like it.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Sorry. If I did, I didn't mean<br>
              to.</p>
            <p> Vivian unconsciously bites her fingernails.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Ugly habit, biting your nails.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You don't know habits, you think<br>
              this is ugly.</p>
            <p> But she puts her hands in her lap. She looks out the window.<br>
              She's safe from Carlos.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Okay, pull over. Let me out.<br>
              I've got to get back to work.</p>
            <p> Edward pulls the Ferrari to the curb and stops.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN (cont'd)<br>
              Stay on this street and you'll<br>
              hit Beverly Hills.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              What do you charge for company,<br>
              Vivian?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Company would cost you... a<br>
              hundred dollars.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              For the whole night?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              For an hour.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              You're joking.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I never joke about money.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Neither do I.<br>
              (a moment; amused)<br>
              A hundred bucks an hour though.<br>
              That's pretty stiff.</p>
            <p> She reaches across the seat. Her hand goes in his lap.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              No, but it's getting there.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Vivian, how much to put up with<br>
              me for the entire night?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You couldn't afford it.</p>
            <p> Vivian starts to get out of the car.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Try me.</p>
            <p> A moment. Vivian's sexy smile comes on.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Three hundred.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Fine.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What's your name, lover.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Edward. My name is Edward.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Edward... you got it!</p>
            <p> Edward gets out of the car. Vivian looks at him confused.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Get in. This side.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              You know how to drive a stick?</p>
            <p> Vivian moves around the car.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Better believe it.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Then let's go. It's worth 300<br>
              just so I don't have to drive.</p>
            <p> They get in the car.</p>
            <p> INT. FERRARI - NIGHT</p>
            <p> She starts the car, revs it.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Here we go Edward.</p>
            <p> EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The Ferrari peels out, fishtails madly and SCREAMS up the<br>
              street.</p>
            <p> EXT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Thousands of tiny white lights sparkle along the walls of the<br>
              Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Bright flags are illuminated<br>
              by carefully placed spotlights. The Ferrari SCREAMS into the<br>
              driveway and comes to a jarring stop by the front door.</p>
            <p> INT. FERRARI - NIGHT<br>
              <br>
              Edward takes a moment to get his breath. He gestures toward<br>
              the back.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              My raincoat's in the back. Put it on.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Why?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              You may feel more comfortable.<br>
              This is not the kind of place that<br>
              rents rooms by the hour.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You mean they don't have hookers.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Every place has hookers, but if<br>
              this hotel has hookers, they don't<br>
              look like they're...</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Off the boulevard.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Exactly.</p>
            <p> INT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As they walk in, Vivian is tying the trenchcoat.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Great. Now I took like a hooker<br>
              in a trenchcoat.</p>
            <p> She looks up. She stops in her tracks. The lobby is bright<br>
              and spacious, filled with thick carved wood paneling. Even at<br>
              this hour there is a great deal of activity. MEN in business<br>
              suits and WOMEN in furs and jewels are passing by. Vivian's<br>
              face quickly conceals the sudden awe she feels at the sight of<br>
              all this luxury. Vivian matter of factly reaches out and takes<br>
              Edward's arm.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              So let's go.</p>
            <p> Edward guides them across the lobby. They reach the elevators<br>
              and go inside.</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL - ELEVATOR - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The young ELEVATOR OPERATOR is dressed in a clean red uniform 
              that seems just a bit too tight. As the elevator doors close<br>
              he nods toward Edward.</p>
            <p> OPERATOR<br>
              Evening, sir.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Good evening. Penthouse.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Penthouse. My, my.</p>
            <p> She sees the operator glancing at her.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              The penthouse. And step on it.</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Edward and Vivian come out of the elevator into a hallway<br>
              leading to a single doorway with two heavy wood doors. Edward<br>
              pulls out his key and unlocks the doors. With a gentle push<br>
              the door slide open in unison. Edward gestures to Vivian to<br>
              go inside. She does. Edward closes the doors behind her.</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As Vivian steps into the room she has the sensation of falling<br>
              off the top of the building. In front of her is a sunken living<br>
              room with massive windows revealing the sparkling lights of the<br>
              city below. For the first time, she is speechless. Edward<br>
              closes the door and walks past her down the steps to the living<br>
              room. Edward picks up a phone. Vivian checks out the room.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (into the phone)<br>
              Room service.<br>
              (to Vivian)<br>
              What do you drink?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Diet coke.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (into the phone)<br>
              Send up a bottle of Crystal<br>
              champagne.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Can I have some chips?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (into the phone)<br>
              -- and a bowl of strawberries.<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> Vivian makes her way down the steps to the living room. She<br>
              stares at the view.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (to Vivian)<br>
              Impressed?</p>
            <p> Vivian is impressed but she's not going to admit it.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You kidding? I come here all the <br>
              time. As a matter of fact they<br>
              do rent this room by the hour.</p>
            <p> Edward smiles. He sits down in a comfortable chair and leans<br>
              back. Vivian looks at him.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN (cont'd)<br>
              Well, now that you have me for<br>
              the night, what are you going to<br>
              do with me?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Want to know something? I don't<br>
              quite know. I hadn't planned<br>
              this.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Do you plan everything?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (a small smile)<br>
              Always.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Well, the meter's running, it's<br>
              your money. Speaking of which,<br>
              cash'll do. In advance.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Fair enough.</p>
            <p> He rises. Takes out his wallet. Standing over her, he drops<br>
              THREE crisp, new hundred dollar bills in Vivian's lap. She<br>
              picks up the bills, stares at them, trying not to be impressed.<br>
              She puts the money in her jacket. She realizes Edward is<br>
              standing over her as if waiting.</p>
            <p> She leans forward, reaches out to unzip his pants. He abruptly<br>
              turns away.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Let's talk some more first.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Right.<br>
              (brightly)<br>
              So! In town on business?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (taking off his jacket)<br>
              Uh-huh.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (loosening his tie)<br>
              And why do you say that?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (a small smile)<br>
              I dunno... you have that sharp,<br>
              useless look.</p>
            <p> Edward almost smiles. He sits across from her again.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Sounds like you've known a lot<br>
              of lawyers.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I've known a lot of everybody.</p>
            <p> A chime goes off to indicate there's someone at the door.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Champagne.</p>
            <p> He starts to sit up. Vivian motions for him to stay put.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Hey. I might as well make myself<br>
              useful.</p>
            <p> Edward sits back down. Vivian waltzes up the steps and opens<br>
              the front door. A WAITER comes into the room with a silver<br>
              cart; on it is a bucket of champagne and a covered bowl.</p>
            <p> WAITER<br>
              Where would you like it?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Where would we like it?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Where would we like it? Here'll<br>
              be fine.</p>
            <p> The Waiter carries it down the steps and sets it in the middle<br>
              of the living room. He turns and heads back up the stairs and<br>
              pauses near Vivian, staring. Vivian stares back at him.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What are you looking at?</p>
            <p> The Waiter glances away uncomfortably and exits. Vivian closes<br>
              the door behind him. Vivian marches back down the stairs.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I think he wanted you to tip him.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Tsk. Excuse me, I didn't think<br>
              he had change for a hundred.</p>
            <p> Edward crosses to the silver stand. Vivian watches with<br>
              interest as he twirls the champagne bottle in the ice bucket.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN (cont'd)<br>
              You have a wife? Girlfriend?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I have both.</p>
            <p> Edward lifts the bottle out. He deftly pops the cork on the<br>
              bottle without losing a drop of champagne.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Where are they? Shopping<br>
              together?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              They should be. They're both good<br>
              at it.</p>
            <p> Edward pours the champagne into a single long stemmed glass and<br>
              hands one to Vivian.</p>
            <p> EDWARD (cont'd)<br>
              My ex-wife lives in London in what<br>
              used to be my home.<br>
              My girlfriend is in New York<br>
              moving out of my apartment even<br>
              as we speak. Cheers.</p>
            <p> He drinks, nods approvingly.</p>

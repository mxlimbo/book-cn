              EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SUNSET</p>
            <p> The setting sun casts an incredibly glow over the city and the<br>
              coast.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN (O.S.)<br>
              You ever been in love with anyone?</p>
            <p> INT. CORPORATE JET - SUNSET</p>
            <p> Vivian is at the window, looking out. She carefully puts her<br>
              earrings back on. She stares, mesmerized by the skyline, the<br>
              golden gate bridge in the distance. She turns. Edward is<br>
              buttoning his shirt. He is silent.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Sorry. You're not paying me to<br>
              ask you question like that.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Vivian. I'm paying you to be<br>
              you. Be you.<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              Have you? Ever been in love with<br>
              anyone?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You mean, besides Elvis?<br>
              (turning back to the<br>
              window)<br>
              I'm a human being. Sure. Once.<br>
              First time I ever ran away from<br>
              home, I got as far as Atlanta.<br>
              I met this boy. He'd been with<br>
              his parents on their way to<br>
              Chicago. They stopped at a gas<br>
              station. He went to the john.<br>
              When he came back they'd split.<br>
              We sorta started looking out for<br>
              each other. Aw, he was sweet.<br>
              And boy, was he good looking,<br>
              y'know, dark hair and eyes.<br>
              The chicken hawks were on him all<br>
              the time. He hated that.<br>
              Sometimes we'd find a safe place<br>
              to crash nights and we'd curl up<br>
              together and we'd talk about all<br>
              these crazy things. The two of<br>
              us getting married someday.<br>
              Having kids. Stupid stuff.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              What happened to him?</p>
            <p> A moment. Vivian shrugs.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              My father found me. Dragged me<br>
              home. I don't know why, he never<br>
              seemed to like me much when I was<br>
              there.<br>
              (a bitter smile)<br>
              'Cept when he was drunk, then he<br>
              liked me a whole lot.<br>
              (a moment)<br>
              I made it back to Atlanta a year<br>
              later. Andy was gone.</p>
            <p> Silence. Vivian stares out the window.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Aw, but things sure look fine<br>
              when you're sitting way up high.</p>
            <p> Edward moves close to Vivian and putting an arm around her<br>
              shoulders, stares with her out at the view. Vivian rests her<br>
              head against him.</p>
            <p> EXT. SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> An airport limo pulls to a stop in front of the San Francisco<br>
              Opera House. The DRIVER walks around back and opens the<br>
              passenger door. Edward emerges and helps Vivian out.</p>
            <p> INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Edward puts his hand on Vivian's elbow as they walk through<br>
              the elegant lobby.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Some people say that opera is an<br>
              acquired taste, but I don't<br>
              believe it. You can always tell<br>
              when someone goes to the opera<br>
              for the first time. They either<br>
              love it or hate it. Those who<br>
              love it will always love it; those<br>
              who hate it might come to<br>
              appreciate it, but they'll never<br>
              truly love it.</p>
            <p> Vivian is wide eyed as they walk past a beautifully lit fountain 
              with several graceful statues in its center. Everywhere she looks 
              she sees elegantly dressed WOMEN and prosperous looking MEN. It 
              makes her nervous. Without realizing it, she raises a protective 
              hand up to her necklace. She looks as if she suspects someone is 
              going to step up and steal it.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Viv? I really doubt if anyone<br>
              here is going to try and grab it.</p>
            <p> Vivian reluctantly lowers her hands.</p>
            <p> INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A crowd of PEOPLE mill around the lobby, heading toward their<br>
              seats. Vivian is aware of the looks she draws as she passes<br>
              -- curious, even envious looks from the WOMEN, appreciative<br>
              glances from the MEN. Her hands again rises nervously to her<br>
              necklace.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              They all think you look very<br>
              beautiful, Vivian.</p>
            <p> Vivian gives him a grateful look. Relaxing, she lowers her hand<br>
              from the necklace. With a flourish, he offers his arm. She<br>
              takes it. They start forward.</p>
            <p> INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Edward and Vivian take their seats in a box high above the<br>
              stage.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              If it's in Italian, how will I<br>
              know what they're saying?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I'll whisper some of the main<br>
              parts of the story to you. But<br>
              you'll be surprised how much you<br>
              understand. The music conveys<br>
              the story more powerfully than<br>
              any words.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              But don't they have it in<br>
              English?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Vivian, don't be afraid of what<br>
              you don't know. That's the fun<br>
              of it.</p>
            <p> The lights dim.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (resigned)<br>
              Okay. Even if I hate it, I'm<br>
              glad you brought me.</p>
            <p> The orchestra begins to play. Vivian's eyes focus intensely<br>
              on the stage, as if a new world is about to be revealed to her.</p>
            <p> INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE STATE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> IN A MONTAGE OF IMAGES AND MUSIC - LA BOHEME is performed.</p>
            <p> The lights from the stage dance across Vivian's face. Edward<br>
              leans over to translate the tenor's aria.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              What am I? I am a poet. Not<br>
              a man of wealth but one rich in<br>
              dreams. You have come to replace<br>
              my vanished dreams. I dwell now<br>
              only in your eyes.</p>
            <p> The MUSIC ebbs and swells. The sets and costumes change. The<br>
              story continues.</p>
            <p> Edward again leans close to Vivian.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              And now she asks Rudolpho if he<br>
              still thinks her beautiful --</p>
            <p> Vivian raises a hand and gently covers Edward's mouth. Her eyes<br>
              are fixed on the stage. She doesn't need his help.</p>
            <p> The emotions building inside Vivian swell as the music is<br>
              reaching its tragic climax. Her lips tremble. Her eyes fill<br>
              with tears. Edward glances at her. He studies her a long<br>
              moment, watching the emotions play unashamedly across her face.<br>
              Strangely moved, he takes Vivian's hand.</p>
            <p> As the opera ends, they are both swept away by it.</p>
            <p> INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As the lights come up, Vivian wipes off her tear-ruined<br>
              mascara. She sighs, happy. The WOMEN in the next box smile<br>
              at her.</p>
            <p> OLDER WOMAN<br>
              Did you enjoy the opera, dear?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (tearfully)<br>
              It was so beautiful I just about<br>
              pissed my pants.</p>
            <p> Edward smiles at the now shocked looking Older Woman and he<br>
              and the still misty Vivian exit.</p>
            <p> INT. CORPORATE JET - NIGHT - LATER</p>
            <p> Edward and Vivian sit side by side.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              If you'd gone on about how much<br>
              you liked it, I'm not sure I'd<br>
              have believed you.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I more than liked it.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I know. I'm glad.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Did you?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Yes. I've never enjoyed it more.<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> Vivian looks at him a moment. And then, leaning slowly forward<br>
              she kisses him gently on the mouth. He looks at her surprise.<br>
              He puts his arms around her and kisses her back. It is the<br>
              first time they've kissed and they make it very special.</p>
            <p> EXT. CORPORATE JET - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The plane flies in the night. Back to L.A.</p>
            <p> INT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> IN A SERIES OF CROSS FADES Edward and Vivian make love.<br>
              Equally giving, equally taking. No masks, no shields.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER</p>
            <p> In the darkened bedroom, Edward and Vivian lie together.<br>
              Edward cradles Vivian. Her back rests against his chest. His<br>
              arm is over her body.</p>
            <p> She takes Edward's hand in her hands and carefully examines<br>
              it; marveling at the fingers, the tiny hairs on the back. She<br>
              gently kisses the palm.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Love you...</p>
            <p> She clutches Edward's hand tightly to her breast. She closes<br>
              her eyes, ready to sleep now.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - ANGLE ON EDWARD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> His eyes open. Vivian's whispered endearment has filled with<br>
              him with sudden confusion and uncertainty. He stares into the<br>
              dark, wondering what to do with the woman in his arms.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE - OUTDOOR PATIO - MORNING</p>
            <p> The phone rings. Edward immediately reaches out and picks it <br>
              up. He is dressed in a robe. Breakfast is on the umbrella'd<br>
              table in front of him.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Yes?</p>
            <p> INT. STUCKEY'S HOME - LIBRARY- MORNING - INTERCUT</p>
            <p> Stuckey, not even dressed yet, paces around his desk.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Did I wake you?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I'm up.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              I had to call. I jus got off<br>
              the phone with James Kross. Get<br>
              this. He wants to see you.<br>
              Today.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Why?</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              He wouldn't say. Edward... I<br>
              think we got him. His nuts are<br>
              on the block and we got him.<br>
              (silence)<br>
              You there?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Give me twenty minutes.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              We'll be there. Listen, if he's<br>
              really caving in, we'll go from<br>
              there down to the office. I want<br>
              him to commit his stock to us this<br>
              morning.</p>
            <p> Edward hangs up. His mind seems on other things. He rises.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING</p>
            <p> Vivian is still asleep. She is face down on the bed, the<br>
              sheets just covering her to her waist. Edward stares down at<br>
              her. He gently reaches out and runs a finger down the soft line<br>
              of her spine. Vivian murmurs contentedly.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Mmm.<br>
              (opening her eyes;<br>
              looking at him)<br>
              Hi.</p>
            <p> Edward smiles at her softly. And then:</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Better get dressed. We're having guests.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian is wearing her yellow dress. She stares at herself in<br>
              the bedroom mirror. Her hair... her make-up... she realizes<br>
              how different she is now, realizes that she likes it.</p>
            <p> Edward comes out of the bathroom. He crosses to the closet<br>
              for a tie.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Here. Let me.</p>
            <p> She comes over, starts to tie his tie for him. He is very<br>
              aware of the closeness of her. She smiles at him. He smiles;<br>
              puts his hand on her stopping her for a moment. Looking up,<br>
              she sees that he is serious now; no more jokes. He releases<br>
              her hand.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (quietly)<br>
              One more night and you're finally<br>
              rid of me.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I have to go to New York<br>
              tomorrow.</p>
            <p> Vivian says nothing.</p>
            <p> EDWARD (cont'd)<br>
              But I'll be back in Los Angeles.<br>
              Soon. I'd like to see you again.<br>
              I thought we could work out<br>
              something... An arrangement.</p>
            <p> Vivian is silent.</p>
            <p> EDWARD (cont'd)<br>
              I'll get you an apartment, buy<br>
              you a car --</p>
            <p> Vivian sighs, letting something go inside. Finished with his<br>
              tie, she turns away.</p>
            <p> EDWARD (cont'd)<br>
              What is it?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (not unkindly)<br>
              What else? You gonna leave some<br>
              cash by the bed when you pass<br>
              through town?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              It wouldn't be like that. I want<br>
              to get you off the street. You'll<br>
              have a different kind of life.<br>
              What's wrong with that?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I'm sorry. That's very sweet,<br>
              Edward, and I know you mean it...</p>
            <p> She is silent.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Vivian, I've thought about this<br>
              a lot. This is the best solution.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (shakes her head &quot;no,&quot;<br>
              then continues tying<br>
              his tie)<br>
              When I was a little girl, my<br>
              mother locked me in the attic when<br>
              I was bad, which was pretty often.<br>
              I'd stare out the window up there<br>
              and make believe I was a princess<br>
              trapped in the tower by the wicked<br>
              queen. Then suddenly a knight<br>
              on a white horse with his bright<br>
              colors flying would ride up.<br>
              Rescue me from the tower, and then<br>
              we'd ride off... but never, ever<br>
              in all the times I had that dream<br>
              did the knight say, &quot;Come on baby,<br>
              I'll put you up in a great condo.&quot;</p>
            <p> She finished his tie.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (softly; to herself)<br>
              I know.<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              Hey, don't mind me. I'm being<br>
              stupid.<br>
              (more)<br>
              I'll think about it, okay? It's<br>
              a real good offer for a whore.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I've never treated you like a<br>
              whore.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (not mean)<br>
              You just did.</p>
            <p> The doorbell suddenly rings in the living room.</p>

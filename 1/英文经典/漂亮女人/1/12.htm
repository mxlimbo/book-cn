              INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> They enter. Edward switches on a light. Vivian comes down the<br>
              steps into the room. Edward follows after her.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              You're awfully quiet. You haven't<br>
              said a word since the party.</p>
            <p> As Edward touches her shoulder, Vivian suddenly spins and<br>
              explodes with anger.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You asshole! I can't believe what<br>
              a --!</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Vivian, what the --</p>
            <p> Tears well in Vivian's eyes as she yells at him.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Clean the slut up, take her out,<br>
              huh?! What are you trying to <br>
              prove!? I'm not a piece of meat<br>
              for you to offer to your friends!</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I don't know what you're talking<br>
              about.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I've been with stinking old men<br>
              who've made me want to puke but<br>
              I've never had anyone make me feel<br>
              as dirty as you did tonight.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Would you please calm down. Tell<br>
              me what happened.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Stuckey! He wants an<br>
              &quot;appointment&quot; with me after you<br>
              leave. You my pimp now or did<br>
              he think that up on his own?</p>
            <p> Edward looks guiltily away.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              What was I supposed to do?<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              I told the truth. Why should the<br>
              truth upset you? It's not as if<br>
              you're from a convent.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I want my fucking money. I'm<br>
              getting out of here. I don't want<br>
              anything more to do with you.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Can we talk about this? Can you<br>
              just try to calm down?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Your goddamned friend, he thinks<br>
              the only reason I'm with you is<br>
              for the money.</p>
            <p> A tear falls from Vivian's eyes.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (defiantly)<br>
              Well, it's true. Just pay me<br>
              what you owe me and I'm gone.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Vivian...</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Pay me! Before I pick up this<br>
              chair and smash your face in.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Fine. I'm only here a couple<br>
              of more days and I'm not going<br>
              to spend them fighting with you.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Fuck off.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I'll call you a cab. If you want<br>
              the clothes, pack them up.</p>
            <p> Vivian stands quietly for a moment. And then she turns and<br>
              walks into the bedroom.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Vivian starts roughly picking up her clothes in the dim light<br>
              of the bedroom. As she does she starts crying. With each item<br>
              of clothing the tears come down harder. Edward appears at the<br>
              doorway. His face is genuinely concerned.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Vivian... I'm sorry. I wasn't<br>
              prepared for questions about us.<br>
              It was an idiotic and insensitive<br>
              thing I did. I should have known<br>
              that it would hurt you.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I'm not hurt. It doesn't hurt<br>
              you when somebody pisses on you,<br>
              it just pissed you off.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I really am sorry.</p>
            <p> Vivian lets the clothes fall from her arms. Sobbing, she stands<br>
              limply.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You hurt me.</p>
            <p> Edward goes to her and wraps his arms around her shoulders.<br>
              She touches his hand. He sits on the bed. He pulls her to him<br>
              and wraps his arms around her, holds her tight.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I'll make it up to you.</p>
            <p> INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - DAY</p>
            <p> Edward, carrying a briefcase, moves jauntily down a long<br>
              hallway. Stuckey trails after him.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              This is no time to disappear.<br>
              We're in too far.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Bill? Stop panicking. Kross<br>
              isn't going anywhere and I don't <br>
              need to spend the rest of the day<br>
              watching his stock go down. I'll<br>
              be in the office tomorrow.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Promise me you'll read those<br>
              contracts by then.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Goodbye, Bill.</p>
            <p> Stuckey stops. He calls after Edward.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Shit... By tomorrow, Edward!</p>
            <p> Edward hurries on.</p>
            <p> EXT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE - DAY</p>
            <p> Edward exits out of his limo and walks to the front doors.</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY</p>
            <p> Edward smiles, moving jauntily to the elevators. Mr. Thomas<br>
              at the front desk notices Edward's happy mood.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Afternoon.</p>
            <p> Edward's attention is taken by the glittering jewelry display<br>
              in the hotel jewelry store window. He detours from the<br>
              elevators and moves to the window for a closer look. He thinks<br>
              a moment and enters the jewelry store.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE - AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> Vivian comes out of the bedroom into the living room wearing<br>
              an elegant red sequined evening dress. She looks incredibly<br>
              beautiful. She sees the phone. A thought occurs to her and<br>
              going to it, she picks it up. Waits.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              C'mon, Kit...</p>
            <p> No answer. She hears someone at the door. She hangs up.<br>
              Edward enters. He is carrying a small case. He stops at the<br>
              sight of Vivian.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Do I look okay?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (a small smile)<br>
              Hmm... let's see... no, there's<br>
              something missing.</p>
            <p> He holds up the small case.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What's that?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I don't want you to get too<br>
              excited... these are on loan...<br>
              however...</p>
            <p> Vivian's jaw drops. Edward is holding a diamond and ruby<br>
              necklace in his hands, holds it as if it might melt if he<br>
              breathed too hard. Edward behind Vivian, fastens the<br>
              necklace around her neck.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              This is made for a princess.<br>
              I think she'd approve of you<br>
              wearing it tonight. There. <br>
              Come look.</p>
            <p> He leads her to a mirror. She stares at her reflection.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Edward, I can't.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Shush. Of course you can.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What if I lose it?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              You won't.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What if someone tries to steal<br>
              it?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I'll guard them and you with my<br>
              life.</p>
            <p> EDT. BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY</p>
            <p> A limo pulls onto the tarmac at Burbank Airport. A PILOT in<br>
              a leather jacket and sunglasses hurries forward to open the limo 
              <br>
              door. Edward -- now wearing evening clothes -- and Vivian climbs<br>
              out of the limo.</p>
            <p> PILOT<br>
              Your plane is ready to go, Mr.<br>
              Harris.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Very good.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Plane?</p>
            <p> Taking her arm, Edward leads her across the tarmac.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              You don't want to go all the way<br>
              to San Francisco in a limousine,<br>
              do you? I don't.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Where are you taking me!?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              To meet some friends. Rudolpho,<br>
              a poet... Benoit, a landlord...<br>
              Mimi, a flower maker...</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Huh?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              The opera.</p>
            <p> Up ahead is a waiting private jet, its engines already HUMMING.<br>
              She is speechless. Edward grins, loving the look on her face.</p>
            <p> EXT. BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY</p>
            <p> The corporate jet takes off down the landing strip.</p>
            <p> INT. CORPORATE JET - DAY</p>
            <p> Edward and Vivian are alone in the passenger lounge of the jet.<br>
              Vivian can't believe the cabin. It is a comfortable room<br>
              featuring a long couch that curves across two walls, built in<br>
              bar, television and stereo. Edward is once again, going over<br>
              papers.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I've never been on a plane<br>
              before.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I'm glad you like it. Now be<br>
              quiet, I've really got to read<br>
              these.</p>
            <p> Vivian fluffs her hair up. She makes a happy, excited growling<br>
              sound -- Rrrrr! A wicked gleam comes to her eye.</p>
            <p> She walks over to Edward and stands in front of him. He looks<br>
              up. She parts the thigh high slit in her gown to expose silken<br>
              quarters. She begins to unfasten the garters one at a time.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Vivian, what do you think you're<br>
              doing?</p>
            <p> Edward watches silk stockings slide down Vivian's lovely legs.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Being quiet.</p>
            <p> She reaches out and gently caresses Edward's face. Edward sets<br>
              down his papers.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

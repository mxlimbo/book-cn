              INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN</p>
            <p> Vivian pulls a coffee can off a shelf. She pulls off the top.<br>
              It's empty. She tosses the can away, starts for the door. She<br>
              opens it.</p>
            <p> INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Down the hallway, the landlord is standing in front of his open<br>
              doorway, talking to a FAT WOMAN. They both glance up.</p>
            <p> Vivian quickly closes the door. She doesn't want to deal with<br>
              them.</p>
            <p> EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Vivian comes off the fire escape onto the sidewalk. She hurried<br>
              away.</p>
            <p> EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Vivian walks along, urgently looking for something... someone.</p>
            <p> A BABBLING STREET-TYPE goes by happily talking to himself.<br>
              He wears an &quot;I Love Hollywood&quot; t-shirt.</p>
            <p> Vivian passes TOURISTS but doesn't notice them any more than<br>
              she pays attention to the VAGRANT she passes further on, huddle<br>
              in a doorway.</p>
            <p> A LONG-HAIRED KID on a SKATEBOARD goes by dropping off little 
              bags to various STREET-TYPES.</p>
            <p> A BARKER-TYPE stands in front of a photo store urging tourists<br>
              to come in and take a photo with a cardboard cut-out of a movie<br>
              star. Some go in.</p>
            <p> Vivian hurries past a group of rubbernecking JAPANESE TOURISTS.<br>
              A BLACK PROSTITUTE in a mini skirt strolls toward her. A car<br>
              passes. The DRIVER stares at Vivian with interest. She ignores<br>
              him. The black prostitute approaches the car.</p>
            <p> PROSTITUTE<br>
              Hey, baby, you lookin' for a date?</p>
            <p> The Driver looks her over. The Black Prostitute gets in the<br>
              car and it drives away.</p>
            <p> A GROUP OF MEN, mostly drug dealers, hang out at an all night<br>
              coffee shop. They WHISTLE and make obscene gestures and SOUNDS<br>
              as Vivian hurries by. She ignores them and goes next door into<br>
              a falafel stand. Half a dozen PEOPLE sit at dirty tables inside.</p>
            <p> INT. FALAFEL STAND - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Behind the counter are a MAN and a WOMAN, Vietnamese cooks<br>
              frying food, trying to ignore the unsavory crowd camped in the<br>
              shop.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Chan, you seen Kit tonight?</p>
            <p> COOK 1<br>
              Hi, hi! No see nothing.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You do, tell her I'm looking for her.</p>
            <p> COOK 2<br>
              Looking good, bay-bee.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Yeah, you too, D'Nai. If Kit<br>
              comes in here, tell her stay.</p>
            <p> Both of them nod and smile at Vivian. Vivian exits.</p>
            <p> EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Skateboard zips by a GROUP. We SEE a police car parked at the<br>
              entrance to an alcove. Also, an ambulance. The bubblegum<br>
              lights are going. A CROWD has gathered. The happy man with<br>
              the &quot;I Love Hollywood&quot; t-shirt and a POLICE OFFICER are 
              engaged in tense conversation.</p>
            <p> COP<br>
              They just pulled her out of a<br>
              dumpster in the back. Now talk<br>
              to me.</p>
            <p> MAN<br>
              I tell you, man, I don't know who<br>
              she hang with.</p>
            <p> COP<br>
              She have a pimp?</p>
            <p> MAN<br>
              Cocaine her pimp, man. She a<br>
              strawberry. She be out on these<br>
              streets, day in, day out, tradin'<br>
              her sorry ass for crack. And<br>
              now she dead from it.</p>
            <p> Vivian rushes up to join the outskirts of the crowd as the body<br>
              of a YOUNG GIRL is pulled out of an open dumpster and carried<br>
              towards the waiting ambulance. For a moment Vivian thinks<br>
              it's... no, Vivian turns grimly away.</p>
            <p> Vivian surveys the dark street. And suddenly sees who's she's<br>
              looking for. Walks.</p>
            <p> EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - WIG SHOP - NIGHT</p>
            <p> We SEE a young, tough-looking MAN and WOMAN trying on wigs.<br>
              The STOREKEEPER is a man wearing a dress and wild wig. The<br>
              girl, KIT, is around 18, is dark haired and thin. The young<br>
              man, CARLOS, has his arm sloppily draped across Kit's shoulder.<br>
              They giggle about something, both obviously high. Kit looks<br>
              up, bleary-eyed. She stops. Vivian is standing in front of her.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You spent it on drugs, didn't you?</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Hi, Viv. Carlos, you know my<br>
              roommate, Viv.</p>
            <p> CARLOS<br>
              Lookin' good, baby.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (ignoring him)<br>
              Did you blow it all, Kit? Is it<br>
              all gone?</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Carlos had some great rock.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I bet.<br>
              (beat)<br>
              That was our rent!</p>
            <p> Carlos attempts to put an arm around Vivian's shoulders.</p>
            <p> CARLOS<br>
              Calm down, Chica.</p>
            <p> Vivian throws him off.</p>
            <p> CARLOS<br>
              Ey! What is it you wan', baby?<br>
              I can fix you up.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Beat it, scum bucket!</p>
            <p> CARLOS<br>
              You kiss your mother with that<br>
              mouth? Your frien' still owes<br>
              me 200.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (to Kit)<br>
              Let's go.</p>
            <p> Skateboard appears suddenly, blocking Vivian and Kit's path.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Get out of my face or I'll have<br>
              those cops on your ass in two<br>
              seconds.</p>
            <p> Carlos glares at her. He looks down toward the lights of the<br>
              cop cars. One of the POLICEMEN looks towards them, curiously.<br>
              Vivian waves at the cop.</p>
            <p> CARLOS<br>
              (threatening to Vivian)<br>
              Don't take no dates tonight,<br>
              chica, you got one with me.</p>
            <p> Vivian grabs Kit by the arm and pulls her across the Boulevard.</p>
            <p> INT. FALAFEL STAND - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Vivian and Kit sit at a table sipping tea. Vivian is still mad 
              at her.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              We worked for that money. We<br>
              were gonna put together enough<br>
              to get out of that dump we live<br>
              in, get off this street.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Viv... don't be stupid. We're<br>
              whores.</p>
            <p> Vivian looks like she wants to weep. Or scream. She does<br>
              neither. She slowly nods. Kit's sorry she said that.</p>
            <p> KIT (cont'd)<br>
              So I blew our stash. We could<br>
              make it all back with one good<br>
              night on the streets.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I just saw somebody pulled out<br>
              of a dumpster. I wonder how much<br>
              she made tonight?</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Don't be mad at me. I'll pay<br>
              you back. I promise.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I thought you were giving up that<br>
              drug shit.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              I will. I'm trying.<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              Meanwhile I got some crack left,<br>
              you wanna get high?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              No, let's go to work. Okay?</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Okay.<br>
              (then touches her hand)<br>
              I'm sorry I said your dream was<br>
              stupid.</p>
            <p> EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Edward's Ferrari turns onto Hollywood Blvd., finally out of<br>
              the Hollywood Hills.</p>
            <p> EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Vivian and Kit are out trying to hustle John's in passing cars.<br>
              Vivian strikes a sexy pose at the bus stop. Kit is talking to<br>
              another prostitute, RACHEL.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              No no, honey. You see these<br>
              stars on the sidewalk. Me and<br>
              Vivian work from Don Ameche all<br>
              the way up to Roy Rogers.<br>
              This is our office. We got<br>
              seniority. Get off our corner.</p>
            <p> RACHEL<br>
              I was just taking a rest here.<br>
              Besides, she's new.<br>
              (points to Vivian)</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              But I'm old. Go rest up by Monty<br>
              Hall or Debra Paget where you<br>
              belong.</p>
            <p> Rachel walks off.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (looks at passing cars)<br>
              Looks slow tonight.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Maybe we should get a pimp.<br>
              Carlos likes you and --</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Forget it. We work for it. We<br>
              keep it.</p>
            <p> They keep hustling.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              I can't handle this tonight.<br>
              I'm going home.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (stares at her)<br>
              That crack is burning a hole in<br>
              your pocket. There isn't even<br>
              milk in the fridge. The rent's<br>
              due. Now come on --</p>
            <p> EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - ANGLE ON FERRARI - NIGHT</p>
            <p> KIT (O.S.)<br>
              (suddenly)<br>
              Hey, hey -- There's a rent.</p>
            <p> EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - BACK TO SCENE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              He's not gonna want us.</p>
            <p> The Ferrari goes by and stops.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (calls out to Vivian)<br>
              Excuse me.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              (excited)<br>
              Don't take less than a hundred.<br>
              You look hot tonight. And<br>
              remember, don't mouth off. They<br>
              don't like that.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Okay. Go home. But take it easy<br>
              on that shit.</p>
            <p> Kit gives Vivian a quick hug.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              You're the greatest. I'll wait<br>
              up for you.</p>
            <p> And then Kit is off, moving quickly away. Vivian turns. She<br>
              stares at the Ferrari, loathing it and all it represents. And<br>
              then it's as if Vivian turns a switch. She fluffs her mane of<br>
              hair, throws her shoulders back, thrusting her breasts out and<br>
              sashays towards the car, a sexy, friendly smile on her face.</p>
            <p> In the driver's seat of the Ferrari, Edward is looking furious<br>
              and distracted. Vivian leans over the passenger window.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              What's that?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You looking' for some company?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Uh, no. How do I get to Beverly<br>
              Hills?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What?<br>
              (dropping the come on)<br>
              You gonna tell me you're lost?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Great. What do I look like a<br>
              tourguide?</p>
            <p> Edward takes a good look at her.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              No, you look like a hooker.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Actually, I'm a movie star out<br>
              for a walk.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Good. Can you tell me how to<br>
              get to Beverly Hills?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Sure. For five bucks.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              That's ridiculous.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              The price just went up to ten.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Why don't you just do it out of<br>
              the kindness of your heart?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (sweetly)<br>
              Sit... and spin.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Sit-and-spin.<br>
              (amused)<br>
              Alright... why not?</p>
            <p> He pulls out his money clip.</p>
            <p> Vivian suddenly freezes. On the sidewalk up ahead, Carlos and<br>
              Skateboard. Carlos flashes an evil, menacing grin. He motions<br>
              to Skateboard, they start forward.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (holding up a bill)<br>
              You have change for a twenty.</p>
            <p> Vivian pulls open the door of the car and jumps in.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              For twenty, Ill show you<br>

              INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian turns on the water in the tub. It fills the tub in a<br>
              torrential rush.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You could hold a pep rally in<br>
              here!</p>
            <p> The phone on the marbled bathroom wall suddenly rings. Edward<br>
              reaches for it.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (into the phone)<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> INT. STUCKEY'S HOUSE - INTERCUT</p>
            <p> Stuckey is walking around his desk.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Edward, it's me. Kross is all<br>
              set for tonight.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian stares curiously at the bidet.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Listen, I gotta say this again,<br>
              I don't like you going alone.</p>
            <p> She turns it on. The water hits her in the face.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (stifling a chuckle)<br>
              I'm a big boy.</p>
            <p> There are lotions and shampoos and bubblebaths on the edge of<br>
              the tub. Vivian regards them like a kid in a candy shop.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Let me at least get you a date.<br>
              Keep it social.</p>
            <p> Edward watches as Vivian smells some bubble bath. She smiles.<br>
              Her eyes ask Edward if it's okay to...? He nods.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Edward, did you hear me?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I'm here.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              I know a lot of nice girls.</p>
            <p> Vivian pours the bubblebath into the swirling water. There's<br>
              something about the look on her face... the way she bites her<br>
              lower lip... curious, sensual...</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I have one.</p>
            <p> Edward hangs up the phone as Vivian curiously turns on the<br>
              television. The sound blares. She fumbles to turn it down.<br>
              Edward reaches over and turns it off.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              All right. How much for the week?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I'm in town until Saturday.</p>
            <p> She look at him like he isn't speaking English.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Do-you-want-to-stay-here-<br>
              for-the-week?</p>
            <p> It takes Vivian a moment to respond.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              It'd cost you.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Of course. How much?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Five full nights... days too?</p>
            <p> Edward nods. Vivian hesitates... it's got to be enough to<br>
              really change things... She shoots for the moon again.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Four thousand.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Vivian, may I point out five more<br>
              nights at three hundred a night<br>
              is only 1,500.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              But you want days too.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              All right, two thousand.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Three.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Done.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Holy shit.</p>
            <p> And then, quickly getting herself back together, she flips on<br>
              the sexy smile.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN (cont'd)<br>
              Sugar, you got it. I will treat<br>
              you like a prince. Anything,<br>
              anyway you want.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I'm not just talking about sex.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Look butthead, I'll treat you so<br>
              nice you'll never want to let me<br>
              go, okay?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Three thousand for five days.<br>
              And Vivian, I will let you go.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING</p>
            <p> Edward comes out into the bedroom. Vivian quickly follows.<br>
              They move through the bedroom into the living room.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I'll be out most of the day.</p>
            <p> He reaches into his pocket for a money clip. He peels off<br>
              bills. He hands the cash to Vivian.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I want you to go out and buy some<br>
              decent clothes.</p>
            <p> Vivian's eyes go wide at the amount of money.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Nothing too flashy, not too sexy.<br>
              Conservative. Understand?</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE ENTRANCE WAY - DAY</p>
            <p> They're at the front door.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Yeah, you want me to dress like<br>
              your high class girlfriend.<br>
              You're wasting your money though.<br>
              All I'm gonna do is hang around<br>
              the hotel. As a matter of fact, <br>
              I may never get out of that<br>
              bathtub.</p>
            <p> Edward opens the door, he starts to exit. He turns back.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Think again. I'm taking you out<br>
              to an important dinner with me<br>
              tonight.</p>
            <p> The door closes in her face.</p>
            <p> INT. OUTSIDE THE PENTHOUSE DOOR - DAY</p>
            <p> VIVIAN (O.S.)<br>
              (from inside)<br>
              What? Are you crazy?</p>
            <p> Edward smiles to himself.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Probably.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian is stretched out in the hot bubble bath. The TV is on.<br>
              She clicks the remote control in her hand.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Three thousand...</p>
            <p> She lies back into the soapy water and disappears. She suddenly<br>
              pops back up, laughing.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Three thousand!</p>
            <p> A thought occurs to her. She reaches for the cordless phone.<br>
              She dials. She waits. She is about to disconnect when the<br>
              phone is answered.</p>
            <p> KIT (O.S.)<br>
              'Lo.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Kit! Where've you been?</p>
            <p> KIT (O.S.)<br>
              I was asleep. You woke me. You<br>
              okay?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Kit, listen, the guy last night,<br>
              the one in the Ferrari, I'm at<br>
              this hotel, the Regent Beverly<br>
              Wilshire, it's this absolutely<br>
              unbelievable place and he's hired<br>
              me for a whole week and Kit,<br>
              listen, he's paying me three<br>
              thousand bucks! We can get out<br>
              of the apartment. We can get out<br>
              of this town. We can do anything!<br>
              (silence)<br>
              Kit? Hey, you there?</p>
            <p> KIT (O.S.)<br>
              Why'd he want you?</p>
            <p> That hurts. Perhaps because Vivian's been wondering the same<br>
              thing.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              He... he just does.</p>
            <p> KIT (O.S.)<br>
              I'm sorry, Viv'. Carlos has been<br>
              on my back.<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              Did you get the money up front<br>
              like I taught ya'?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Three hundred for last night and<br>
              he gave me extra to buy some<br>
              clothes. Now listen, I'm gonna<br>
              leave an envelope for you at the<br>
              front desk.<br>
              Give me two hundred to the scum<br>
              bucket and the other hundred to<br>
              that asshole landlord for part<br>
              of the rent. Spend it on drugs<br>
              and I'll pull your hair out.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              I'm getting dressed now. I'll <br>
              be over. Bye.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Hey Kit, where do I go for the<br>
              clothes? Good stuff on him.</p>
            <p> KIT (O.S.)<br>
              (brightening)<br>
              In Beverly Hills?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Yeah.</p>
            <p> KIT (O.S.)<br>
              Baby! Rodeo Drive.</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian comes out of the elevator and crosses the lobby. She<br>
              is back in her hooker clothes. She leaves an envelope at the<br>
              front desk.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS, the prim, middle-aged hotel manager, steps out from<br>
              his office. He stares in surprise and displeasure as he sees<br>
              Vivian exit out the front door. Vivian doesn't notice the odd<br>
              stares she gets from two well-dressed MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN who are 
              just entering.</p>
            <p> EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian is looking wide-eyed and delighted and yes, more than<br>
              a bit overwhelmed. She passes store windows... and MORE STORE<br>
              WINDOWS... and still MORE STORE WINDOWS. Each display is more beautiful 
              and expensive than the one before.</p>
            <p> Vivian is also aware that she is getting odd looks. From<br>
              PASSERBY'S. Two beautiful dressed GIRLS her own age look at<br>
              her, turn away and giggle. The uniformed GUARDS that stand at<br>
              attention in front of many of the stores, stare at her suspiciously.</p>
            <p> Feeling more and more uncomfortable, Vivian comes to a posh<br>
              woman's boutique. She hesitates for a moment. She enters.</p>
            <p> INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian is no sooner in the door than she is subject to the<br>
              disapproving stare of a SALESWOMAN standing behind the counter.</p>
            <p> SALESWOMAN<br>
              (cooly)<br>
              May I help you?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I'm just looking, thanks.</p>
            <p> Vivian tiptoes through the shop as if it was filled with delicate 
              glass objects. She cautiously examines a dress. The Saleswoman quickly 
              comes around the counter and approaches her.</p>
            <p> SALESWOMAN<br>
              Are you looking for something in particular?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Yes. Something... conservative.</p>
            <p> SALESWOMAN<br>
              Yes...</p>
            <p> Vivian eyes the Saleswoman, puzzled at her tone. She examines<br>
              a dress.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You have beautiful things.<br>
              (no reply)<br>
              How much is this?</p>
            <p> SALESWOMAN<br>
              I don't think it would fit you.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (beginning to get the<br>
              drift)<br>
              I didn't ask if it would fit.<br>
              I asked how much it was.</p>
            <p> SALESWOMAN<br>
              It's very expensive.</p>
            <p> Vivian's body tenses as she stares at the Saleswoman.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What is with you?</p>
            <p> SALESWOMAN<br>
              (unblinking)<br>
              Excuse me?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I'm going to spend money.</p>
            <p> SALESWOMAN<br>
              I don't think we have anything<br>
              for you here. You're obviously<br>
              in the wrong place.</p>
            <p> Vivian is speechless. She turns and stomps toward the door.<br>
              She stops and spins around staring at the Saleswoman. Vivian<br>
              flips her off. She throws the door open and storms outside.<br>
              The Saleswoman calmly strolls back to her counter and returns<br>
              to her place.</p>

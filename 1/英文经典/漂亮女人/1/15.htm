              INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - DAY</p>
            <p> Edward is walking down the hall. Stuckey comes out of the<br>
              office and calls after him.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              (calls)<br>
              Edward, what happened? What kind<br>
              of move was that?</p>
            <p> Edward silently goes into the elevators. The doors close.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              (yells)<br>
              Dammit Edward, speak to me.</p>
            <p> Stuckey heads back to the conference room.</p>
            <p> EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> Edward comes out of the building. His Chauffeur leaps to open<br>
              the limo door.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              No... take the car back to the<br>
              hotel. I need to walk.</p>
            <p> He sets off across Century Park East.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE - EVENING</p>
            <p> Vivian is in the living room, pacing, edgy, the doorbell rings.<br>
              She turns. It rings again.</p>
            <p> She opens it. Stuckey is standing outside with a small<br>
              briefcase. He looks agitated. He tries to hide it.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Well, well... Hello again. I'm<br>
              looking for Edward.</p>
            <p> Vivian just stares at him.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Edward's not back. I thought<br>
              he was with you.</p>
            <p> Stuckey walks past her and down the steps into the living room.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              No, I'll just have to wait then,<br>
              won't I?</p>
            <p> There is a bar set up. Stuckey sets his briefcase down. He<br>
              crosses to the bar.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY (cont'd)<br>
              Mind if I have a drink?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> He pours liquor in a glass. He fires it down. It seems to<br>
              calm him a bit.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Do you want to know what he did?<br>
              Do you want to know what the crazy<br>
              son of a bitch did? He handed<br>
              the whole thing back to Kross!<br>
              On a silver platter. For no<br>
              reason! What was he thinking,<br>
              I mean, what was going through<br>
              his goddam head? Why?<br>
              (pours another drink)<br>
              What was all that benevolent<br>
              crap? What are we going to<br>
              become, a philanthropic<br>
              foundation? I'll probably be the<br>
              director of several worthwhile<br>
              charities.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I think it's great.</p>
            <p> Stuckey glares at Vivian.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              I bet. A lousy whore and you're<br>
              the gum in a hundred million<br>
              dollar deal.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (mocking)<br>
              Aw, come on, Bill. It's just<br>
              business.</p>
            <p> He looks at her a moment.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              But what do I know, maybe you're<br>
              worth it. Come on, show me.<br>
              Let's see your act.</p>
            <p> He grabs her wrist.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Get out!</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Don't worry. I'll pay for it.<br>
              What a you charge? Huh? Twenty,<br>
              thirty, fifty bucks, maybe? Are<br>
              you a fifty dollar whore?</p>
            <p> He tries to kiss her and pulls her down on the couch on top<br>
              of him.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Are you crazy?</p>
            <p> She bites his hand. Stuckey slaps her. Vivian starts flailing<br>
              back. But Stuckey is too strong. Vivian staggers back at the<br>
              force of another slap. Stuckey slams her up against a wall and<br>
              starts rubbing up against her.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              You got a mean streak in you,<br>
              don't you.</p>
            <p> He tries to kiss her again.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY (cont'd)<br>
              Is that what he likes about you?<br>
              Huh? Answer me!</p>
            <p> And suddenly a HAND lands on Stuckey's shoulder. Stuckey turns<br>
              his head, startled.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE - REVERSE ANGLE - STUCKEY'S P.O.V.</p>
            <p> Edward, murder in his eyes, belts Stuckey across the room.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT - BACK TO SCENE</p>
            <p> Stuckey falls on the ground. Edward rushes forward, berserk<br>
              with rage, to hit Stuckey again. His fist hits the top of<br>
              Stuckey's head, hurting Edward's hand more than Stuckey's skull.</p>
            <p> Vivian rushes out of room to bathroom. Again Stuckey tries<br>
              to rise. Edward kicks him in the butt, sends him headfirst into<br>
              the bar. Glasses and bottles CRASH to the floor. Stuckey again<br>
              tries to rise. And collapses. Edward rubs his fist. They're<br>
              not used to this violence and both stare at each other panting.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              You broke my nose.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I think I broke my hand.<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              You're fired.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Edward, we've been together ten<br>
              years.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              And I don't like what we've<br>
              become. I'll cover any losses<br>
              you have on this one. Now get<br>
              out, you asshole!</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              All this because of that whore!</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> Edward pushes Stuckey out the door and throws his briefcase<br>
              after him.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Edward, think about what you're<br>
              --</p>
            <p><br>
              Edward slams the door in his face. Edward stands there,<br>
              reflecting on what he's done.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (to himself, almost proud)<br>
              Well, I didn't plan that!</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER</p>
            <p> Edward holds an icepack to Vivian's cheek.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Why do guys always know how to<br>
              hit a woman? Right across the<br>
              cheek, wham, so it feels like your<br>
              eye is gonna explode. What do<br>
              they do, take you all aside in<br>
              high school and show you how?<br>
              It pisses me off!</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Not all men hit. And no one is<br>
              going to hit you anymore.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Right.<br>
              (softening)<br>
              You're quite the Sir Galahad<br>
              today, aren't ya'?<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              I heard what you did with Kross.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              It was a business decision.</p>
            <p> Vivian looks at him.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I got tired of hating my father.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (a small smile)<br>
              It was good.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              It felt good.</p>
            <p> Edward looks on the bed at her suitcases.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              You're packing.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (nods)<br>
              I'm leaving.<br>
              (a moment)<br>
              Don't ya see? If I stay with<br>
              you like you want me to, there'll<br>
              always be some guy, your friends<br>
              eve, treatin' me like that...<br>
              thinkin' they're allowed to. What<br>
              are you gonna do, fight'm all?<br>
              No. I'll take my money now,<br>
              please.</p>
            <p> A moment. Edward reaches for his wallet. He counts out bills.<br>
              He places them in Vivian's suitcase. He puts his arms around<br>
              Vivian.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Aw, don't... no...</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Stay with me tonight. Not<br>
              because you're being paid to.<br>
              Stay with me because you want to.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I do. I do want to. That's why<br>
              I'm leaving.<br>
              (turning to him)<br>
              That's what you given me, see?<br>
              I know what I want now. I want<br>
              a guy like you for real. Not<br>
              because you buy me things and give<br>
              me money. The nicest thing you<br>
              ever done for me is hold my hand.<br>
              You gonna give me that?</p>
            <p> Edward is silent.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I didn't think so.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Vivian...</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              It's not your fault. You're<br>
              right. Kit's right.<br>
              (looks him right in the eye)<br>
              But I want the fairy tale.</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING</p>
            <p> Vivian comes out of the elevators. A BELLMAN sees her and<br>
              springs forward, reaching for her bags.</p>
            <p> BELLMAN<br>
              Let me take those, miss.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Thanks.</p>
            <p> Vivian sees Mr. Thomas behind the front desk.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I'll be out front in a minute.<br>
              I got a cab comin'.</p>
            <p> The bellman moves away. Vivian walks to the front desk.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Hi, Barney!</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              (looking up)<br>
              Miss Vivian.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Look I just wanted to say<br>
              goodbye.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Mr. Harris doesn't check out<br>
              until tomorrow.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Yeah, well, I check out today.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              You're not accompanying him to<br>
              New York?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (lightly)<br>
              Come on, Barney, you and me live<br>
              in the real world.<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              You don't know how to treat a girl<br>
              like anything but a lady, Mr.<br>
              Thomas.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Certain ladies make that very<br>
              easy... Vivian.<br>
              (turning to the desk clerk)<br>
              John, call a limousine for our<br>
              guest, please. Have it take her<br>
              anywhere she wishes to go. Bill<br>
              the hotel.<br>
              (turning back to Vivian)<br>
              See you again sometime soon.</p>
            <p> Vivian smiles softly at him. She turns and walks for the door.</p>

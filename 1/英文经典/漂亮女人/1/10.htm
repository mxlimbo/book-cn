              INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY</p>
            <p> Mr. Thomas looks up from the desk. And stares. Vivian and a<br>
              BELLHOP stroll through the hotel entrance and across the hotel<br>
              lobby to the elevator. The bellhop's arms are packed with boxes<br>
              and shopping bags. Mr. Thomas can't help it. He smiles to<br>
              himself.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian opens the front door for the Bellhop who carries in her<br>
              packages. She motions for him to place them on the couch. He<br>
              does. Vivian happily tips him with a five dollar bill. He<br>
              exits. The door closes.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Wheee!!!</p>
            <p> Vivian does a giddy spin and falls onto the couch.</p>
            <p> INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE MEETING ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Stuckey enters. Edward is standing at the end of a long<br>
              meeting table. He is serving himself coffee from a tray.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              (gloating)<br>
              You were right. Kross mortgaged<br>
              everything he has down to his<br>
              grandson's college tuition to<br>
              secure loans from a bank. Not<br>
              just any bank. One we do business<br>
              with.</p>
            <p> Edward just sips his coffee.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY (cont'd)<br>
              It goes without saying that your<br>
              business means a great deal more<br>
              to them than our friend Kross's.<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              All you have to do is make a call.</p>
            <p> Edward is silent. Stuckey is again surprised.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Excuse me for saying this but what<br>
              is wrong with you this week?<br>
              First, you go soft on the pension<br>
              funds. Now, you're giving him<br>
              the chance to get away? As of<br>
              two minutes ago, you are committed<br>
              to the tune of over fifty million<br>
              dollars --</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Come on, Bill, don't talk to me<br>
              about how much money's involved.<br>
              It's my money.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              And some of it's mine. Edward,<br>
              his jugular's exposed.</p>
            <p> Edward hesitates. Then:</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Get the bank on the phone for me.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE - EVENING</p>
            <p> Edward enters. He closes the door. He turns. And stops. A<br>
              beautiful, candlelit, food laden table has been set up in the<br>
              middle of the room. Champagne and wine chills in a bucket.<br>
              A fire burns in the fireplace. Music is playing.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN (O.S.)<br>
              Hi.</p>
            <p> Edward turns. And stares again. Vivian stands in the bedroom<br>
              doorway. She is wearing an exquisite silk dressing gown. She<br>
              looks incredibly beautiful.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I thought maybe you'd like dinner.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Thank you. I would.<br>
              (he fingers her dressing<br>
              gown)<br>
              Nice.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Wait till you see what I have<br>
              on underneath.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Please.</p>
            <p> She opens the dressing gown. What she has on underneath is<br>
              absolutely nothing. Edward crosses to her. Taking her in his<br>
              arms, he lifts her up and kisses her breasts.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What about dinner?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Dinner can wait.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The bathroom is lit by candles. Vivian and Edward are in the<br>
              marble tub. Vivian sits behind Edward. She lazily washes his<br>
              shoulders and back with a large sponge.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You always been rich?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Seems like it. I guess it's easy<br>
              to get used to, huh?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Easier than learning how to be poor.<br>
              (a moment; and then:)<br>
              My father's family was wealthy.<br>
              When I was young there were cars<br>
              and houses, private schools,<br>
              nannies. But then my father<br>
              divorced my mother to marry<br>
              another woman. And he took his<br>
              money with him.</p>
            <p> Silence.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Keep talkin'. I like hearin'.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Not much to tell. I went to<br>
              public school. Went to<br>
              university on scholarship. Went<br>
              to work for an investment firm.<br>
              In eight years I owned it.<br>
              (and then; growing very<br>
              quiet)<br>
              My father was chairman of the<br>
              board of the third company I ever<br>
              went after. I swallowed that<br>
              company and shit out the pieces.<br>
              One of the pieces was him.</p>
            <p> Vivian softly traces small patterns on Edward's shoulders with<br>
              a finger.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You still mad at'm?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              He died a long time ago.</p>
            <p> She gently rests her head on his back.</p>
            <p> EXT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> PANNING BELLIES People are sunbathing by the pool.<br>
              Overweight... lobster red... old and stretch-marked... fishy<br>
              white... and then gorgeous. The gorgeous is Vivian. She is<br>
              wearing a miniscule bikini and sunglasses.</p>
            <p> WAITER (O.S.)<br>
              Miss Vivian?</p>
            <p> She looks up. A young WAITER, looking a little dry-mouthed at<br>
              the sight of her, is holding a telephone.</p>
            <p> WAITER<br>
              You have a call. Mr. Harris.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (taking the phone)<br>
              Hi, baby.<br>
              (a moment)<br>
              I'll be ready. Bye.</p>
            <p> She hangs up. She looks at the Waiter, confused.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What do you wear to polo?</p>
            <p> EXT. THE LOS ANGELES EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> Horses and riders crash and careen on the playing field. An<br>
              enthusiastic crowd cheers.</p>
            <p> DOWN OFF THE EDGE OF THE FIELD</p>
            <p> a tailgate party using Cadillacs and Rolls Royces is in<br>
              progress. Horses and riders thunder by a crowd of very<br>
              well-dressed, successful-looking people -- celebrities, execs,<br>
              socialites, aficionados -- most of whom ignore the game. They<br>
              are there to see and be seen much more than to watch a polo<br>
              match.</p>
            <p> EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATER AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> Vivian and Edward make their way towards the party. Edward is<br>
              wearing his new tie. Vivian is looking very chic and beautiful<br>
              in one of her new outfits. Not that it's helping -- the place,<br>
              the people, the wealth -- everything here suddenly has her<br>
              overwhelmed. She suddenly stops.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You're really pushing it,<br>
              bringing me here.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I think it's exciting.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What id we run into someone I<br>
              know?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I really doubt anyone here<br>
              frequents Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You did.</p>
            <p> A VOICE calls out.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY (O.S.)<br>
              Edward!</p>
            <p> They turn. William Stuckey is with a group of people. He waves<br>
              them over.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY (cont'd)<br>
              Come on! Over here!</p>
            <p> Edward takes Vivian's arm and leads her forward.</p>
            <p> EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> Stuckey grins and shakes Edward's hand.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              (looking at Vivian)<br>
              Well, well, well...</p>
            <p> Vivian dislikes this guy on sight. Dislikes the frosty looking<br>
              woman at his side.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              (holding out a hand; smiling)<br>
              Bill Stuckey, Vivian. My wife,<br>
              Elizabeth.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Hi.</p>
            <p> Elizabeth Stuckey stretches her thin lips in a col smile.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Lots of fun people here. Let me<br>
              get you two some champagne.</p>
            <p> He moves quickly away.</p>
            <p> ELIZABETH STUCKEY<br>
              Excuse me.</p>
            <p> She moves to greet someone else. Vivian and Edward survey the<br>
              milling CROWD.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (sarcastic)<br>
              Real genuine guy.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              He's good at what he does.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You could freeze ice on his wife's<br>
              ass. She anything like your ex?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (a small smile)<br>
              Shall we mingle?</p>
            <p> EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ON THE FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> A goal is scored.</p>
            <p> IN A SERIES OF CUTS</p>
            <p> Edward watches and guides her, Vivian sips champagne and meets<br>
              and chats and wins over different PEOPLE.</p>
            <p> EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> A group of PEOPLE.</p>
            <p> WOMAN<br>
              I simply love your dress, Vivian.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              This old thing?</p>
            <p> WOMAN<br>
              Of course, a figure like yours<br>
              can wear anything. You must work<br>
              out constantly.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I lead a very physical life.</p>
            <p> OLDER MAN<br>
              Are you into running, Vivian?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I'm into walking. I walk a lot.</p>

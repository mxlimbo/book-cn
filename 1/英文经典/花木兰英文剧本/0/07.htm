            <td>Mulan [gasping as she covers up]: Huh, I can explain.
              <p>Chi Fu [stepping into the tent]: Huh? So it's true.</p>
              <p>Mulan [calling after Shang as he steps out of the tent]: Shang!</p>
              <p>[Cut to outside the tent. Chi Fu hauls out Mulan by the arm. 
                Mulan uses her other hand to hold the blanket]</p>
              <p>Chi Fu: I knew there was something wrong with you. [Chi Fu takes 
                off Mulan's hair tie and throws her to the ground] A woman.</p>
              <p>[Ling, Yao and Chien-Po are shocked]</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [to the troops]: Trecherous snake.</p>
              <p>Mulan [on the ground kneeling and hunched over, speaking to Shang]: 
                My name is Mulan. I did it to save my father.</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [to the troops]: High treason!</p>
              <p>Mulan: I didn't mean for it to go this far.</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [getting in Mulan's face and speaking to her while she 
                whinces]: Ultimate dishonor.</p>
              <p>Mulan: It was the only way. Please believe me.</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [to Shang]: Hmph, Captain?</p>
              <p>[Shang walks over to Khan and takes the sword out of the scabbard 
                attached to Khan. Khan rears back]</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [to the soldier by Khan]: Restrain him.</p>
              <p>[Shang walks toward Mulan with sword in hand]</p>
              <p>Yao, Ling and Chien-Po [rushing toward Mulan]: Noooooo!</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [putting his hand to stop Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po from 
                proceeding further]: You know the law.</p>
              <p>[Shang stands over Mulan. Mulan looks at Shang then bows her 
                head in anticipation. Shang lifts the sword high above his head 
                and throwsit down in front of Mulan]</p>
              <p>Shang: A life for a life. My debt is repaid. [turns and walks 
                towards the Imperial City] Move out!</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [coming up to Shang's face]: But you can't just...</p>
              <p>Shang [getting in Chi Fu's face]: I said, &quot;Move out!&quot;</p>
              <p>[The troops walk off toward the Imperial City leaving Mulan behind 
                with Khan, Cri-Kee, and Mushu. Mulan is sitting, shivering. Khan 
                takeshis blanket and wraps it around Mulan with his mouth and 
                sits behind her. Cri-Kee lights a fire with twigs. When he doesn't 
                get warm, hemoves under the blanket wrapped around Mulan. Mushu 
                walks toward Mulan carrying a stick]</p>
              <p>Mushu: I was this close, this close to impressing the ancestors, 
                getting the top shelf, an entourage. Man, all my fine work, ffft. 
                [Mushu picksup a dumpling with his stick, slumps down in front 
                of the fire Cri-Kee made and begins to cook the dumpling over 
                the fire] [glancing up] Hi.</p>
              <p>Mulan [look of sadness]: I should never have left home.</p>
              <p>Mushu: Eh, come on, you wanted to save your father's life. Who 
                knew you'd end up shaming him, disgracing your ancestors, and 
                losing allyour friends. You know, you just gotta, you gotta learn 
                to let these things go [looking as if he's about to cry].</p>
              <p>Mulan: Maybe I didn't go for my father. Maybe what I really wanted 
                was to prove I could do things right. So when I looked in the 
                mirror[picking up her helmet and looking at her reflection in 
                her helmet] I'd see someone worthwhile. But I was wrong. I see 
                nothing. [throws thehelmet down and a tear runs down her cheek]</p>
              <p>Mushu [picking up the helmet and spitting on it]: Well that's 
                because this just needs a little spit, that's all. Let me shine 
                this up for ya [wipingthe spit to clean the helmet and holding 
                it up to Mulan]. I can see you, look at you, you look so pretty. 
                [seeing Mulan is not cheered up byhis actions, he shows sorrow 
                on his face] The truth is we're both frauds. Your ancestors never 
                sent me, they don't even like me. I mean,you risked your life 
                to help people you love. I risked your life to help myself. At 
                least you had good intentions [Mulan smiles].</p>
              <p>Cri-Kee [jumping on top of the helmet beginning to bawl]: Chirp, 
                Chirp, Chirp. Bawl, Bawl.</p>
              <p>Mushu: What!? What do you mean you're not lucky? You lied to 
                me? [Cri-Kee nods] [to Khan] And what are you? A sheep?</p>
              <p>Mulan [sadly]: I'll have to face my father sooner or later. Let's 
                go home.</p>
              <p>Mushu: Yeah, this ain't gonna be pretty. But, don't you worry, 
                'kay? Things'll work out. We started this thing together and that's 
                how we'llfinish. [Mushu hugs Mulan. Mulan smiles] I promise.</p>
              <p>[Cut to Shan-Yu's falcon flying over the avalanche site. Shan-Yu's 
                hand pops out of the snow. He gets up and glances around]</p>
              <p>Shan-Yu [screaming]: Rrrrrrraaaaaaaaahhh!</p>
              <p>[Hun Archer, Long-Hair Hun Man, Hun Strong Guy, Hun Bald Man 
                #1, and Hun Bald Man #2 each pop out of the snow and joinShan-Yu. 
                They set off towards the Imperial City]</p>
              <p>Mulan [seeing them from behind, gasps]: Huh. [Mulan runs, grabs 
                her sword, mounts Khan, and heads out following the Huns to theImperial 
                City]</p>
              <p>Mushu: Home is that way! [points to the opposite direction Mulan 
                is heading]</p>
              <p>Mulan: I have to do something.</p>
              <p>Mushu: Did you see those Huns!? They popped out of the snow, 
                like daisies!</p>
              <p>Mulan: Are we in this together or not?</p>
              <p>Cri-Kee [emphatically]: Chirp, Chirp.</p>
              <p>Mushu: Well, let's go kick some Huny buns! [Jumps onto Khan and 
                utters fighting words as they ride off to the Imperial City] Wu 
                Hu HaGa, Wu Hu Ha Ga</p>
              <p>[Cut to the victory parade in the Imperial City. Fireworks go 
                off, kites are flying. The drummers march by, followed by the 
                flutist, followedby the acrobats. The Parade Leader follows, then 
                Shang and his men, followed by lion dancers]</p>
              <p>Parade Leader: Make way for the heros of China.</p>
              <p>[Shang leads the men on horseback, all have sorrowful looks on 
                their faces. Mulan rides up through the crowd and stops. She looks 
                aroundand sees Shang in the parade]</p>
              <p>Mulan [calling out]: Shang! [riding next to him]</p>
              <p>Shang [surprised]: Mulan?</p>
              <p>Mulan: The Huns are alive, they're in the city.</p>
              <p>Shang: You don't belong here Mulan, go home.</p>
              <p>Mulan [with a scowl rides khan to the other side of Shang]: Shang, 
                I saw them in the mountains. You have to believe me.</p>
              <p>Shang: Why should I?</p>
              <p>Mulan [riding ahead to block Shang's horse]: Why else would I 
                come back? You said you'd trust Ping. Why is Mulan any different?</p>
              <p>[Shang turns his horse and rides around Mulan and goes forward]</p>
              <p>Mulan [to Yao, Chien-Po and Ling]: Keep your eyes open. I know 
                they're here. Hya.</p>
              <p>[Mulan rides off and stops near the entrance to the palace, she 
                dismounts Khan and runs into the palace yard]</p>
              <p>Mushu: Now where are you going?</p>
              <p>Mulan [calling over her shoulder]: To find someone who will believe 
                me. [Mulan runs into the palace yard] </p>
              <p>[Cut to the parade procession stopping in front of the Emperor 
                on the steps of the palace. Chi Fu stands next to Shang and gives 
                himShan-Yu's sword. The Lion dancers stop behind Shang. A palace 
                man strikes a large gong and the people fall silent]</p>
              <p>Emperor: My children, heaven smiles down upon the Middle Kingdom. 
                China will sleep safely tonight thanks to our brave warriors.</p>
              <p>[The crowd cheers]</p>
              <p>[Cut to Mulan at the fringe of the crowd]</p>
              <p>Mulan [approaching Man #1 laying her hand on his shoulder]: Sir, 
                the Emperor's in danger! [Man #1 rips his shoulder away from Mulan'stouch 
                and moves away] [agitated] But the Huns are here! [Mulan walks 
                up to Man #2] Please, you have to help me. [Man #2 walksaway from 
                Mulan] [turning to Mushu who is standing near her in the yard] 
                No one will listen!</p>
              <p>Mushu: Huh? Oh, I'm sorry, did you say something?</p>
              <p>Mulan [irritatedly]: Mushu!</p>
              <p>Mushu: Hey, you're a girl again, remember?</p>
              <p>[Cut to Shang holding the sword before the Emperor]</p>
              <p>Shang [kneeling down giving the sword to the Emperor]: Your Majesty, 
                I present to you the sword of Shan-Yu.</p>
              <p>Emperor: I know what this means to you, Captain Li. Your father 
                would have been very proud.</p>
              <p>[Shan-Yu's falcon swoops down and takes the sword as Shang is 
                giving it to the Emperor. The falcon rises above the roof and 
                drops thesword to Shan-Yu who was sitting next to the gargoyles 
                in the shadows blending in. He rises out of the shadows to catch 
                the sword so thatall the people can see his face. The masses of 
                people gasp at the sight of Shan-Yu. Shang begins to draw his 
                sword. All 5 of Shan-Yu'smen jump out from behind the dragon knocking 
                down Shang and grab the Emperor knocking off his hat. Hun Bald 
                Man #1 and #2 carrythe Emperor into the Palace. Long-Haired Hun 
                Man and Hun Strong Guy close the palace doors as Hun archer knocks 
                his arrow retreatinginto the Palace to threaten would be rescue 
                attempts]</p>
              <p>Shang [getting up and running toward the closing doors]: No.</p>
              <p>Yao [beckoning to the other soldiers]: C'mon.</p>
              <p>[Shang reaches the palace doors just as they close with all the 
                Huns inside]</p>
              <p>Shan-Yu [laughs evily]: Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.</p>
              <p>[Shang and his soldiers pick up a big stone statue and use it 
                as a battering ram. They are unsuccessful at opening the door. 
                Mulan seeswhat's going on and arrives at the steps]</p>
              <p>Mulan [to herself]: They'll never reach the Emperor in time. 
                [She looks at the columns and runs near to the Shang and his soldiers. 
                Shewhistles loudly catching the soldiers' attention] Hey guys, 
                I've got an idea. [Mulan runs around the palace to the right towards 
                the columns]</p>
              <p>[Song: I'll Make a Man Out of You (reprise) plays in the background 
                during the next action sequence]</p>
              <p>(Be a man) We must be swift as the coursing river(Be a man)With 
                all the force of a great typhoon(Be a man)With all the strength 
                of a raging fireMysterious as the dark side of the moon</p>
              <p>[Yao, Ping and Chien-Po look at one another then drop the statue 
                and follow Mulan. Shang looks astonished. Around the corner Yao, 
                Lingand Chien-Po begin to take off their armor and dress as women. 
                Once the transformation is complete, they take out their sashes 
                andprepare to shimmy up the columns. Shang arrives and taps Mulan 
                on the shoulder. He takes off his cape and wraps it around the 
                columnto signify that he's coming along. They shimmy up the poles 
                together]</p>
              <p>[End song]</p>
              <p>[Cut to Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 arriving with the Emperor and 
                a high balcony within the palace. Shan-Yu drops down from the 
                roof]</p>

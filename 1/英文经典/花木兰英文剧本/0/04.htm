            <td>Mushu: All right, rise and shine sleeping beauty. [Mulan rises 
              and blinks] C'mon [rapping on Mulan's head with each syllable] hup, 
              hup,hup. [Mulan groans, lies back down and pulls the covers over 
              her head. Mushu pulls the covers off Mulan entirely] Get your clothes 
              on. Get ready. Got breakfast for ya. [Mushu jumps onto Mulan's knee 
              with a bowl of porridge] Look, you get porridge, and it's happy 
              to seeyou. [Mushu shows her the bowl with two eggs and bacon looking 
              like a smiley face. Cri-Kee pops up out from the bowl of porridge] 
              Hey,get outta there, you gonna make people sick! [Mushu uses chopsticks 
              to push Cri-Kee out of the porridge]
              <p>Mulan: Am I late?</p>
              <p>Mushu [while feeding Mulan]: No time to talk. Now remember, it's 
                your first day of training so listen to your teacher and no fighting. 
                Playnice with the other kids, unless of course one of the other 
                kids wanna fight, then you have to kick the other kid's butt.</p>
              <p>Mulan [with her mouth full of food]: But I don't wanna kick the 
                other kid's butt.</p>
              <p>Mushu: Don't talk with your mouth full. Now let's see your war 
                face [Mulan looks at him with wide eyes and chipmunk cheeks full 
                of food]. I think my bunny slippers just ran for cover. C'mon 
                scare me, girl! </p>
              <p>Mulan [swallows the food]: Rrrrrrr!</p>
              <p>Mushu [rolling back into the half eaten bowl of porridge]: Oh, 
                that's my tough looking warrior. That's what I'm talking about. 
                Now get outthere and make me proud. [Mushu ties up Mulan's hair]</p>
              <p>[Khan whinnies and pokes his head into the tent]</p>
              <p>Mushu: What do you mean the troops just left? </p>
              <p>Mulan [acting surprised]: They what!? [Mulan hurriedly puts on 
                her clothes and jumps out of the tent going off to join the other 
                recruits] </p>
              <p>Mushu [running out from the tent calling after Mulan]: Wait, 
                you forgot your sword. My little baby off to destroy people [sniffle].</p>
              <p>[Cut to the troops muddling around near Shang's tent]</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [enters stage left]: Order people, order!</p>
              <p>Recruit #2: I'd like a pan fried noodle.</p>
              <p>Chien-Po: Oh, oh, sweet and pungent shrimp [Ling and others begin 
                to laugh]</p>
              <p>Recruit #3: Moo goo gai pan</p>
              <p>Chi Fu: That's not funny.</p>
              <p>[Mulan comes running up to the group]</p>
              <p>Ling [noticing Mulan's arrival]: Looks like our new friend slept 
                in this morning. [Mulan stops between Ling and Yao] [to Ping] 
                Hellooo Ping,Are you hungry?</p>
              <p>Yao: Yeah, 'cause I owe you a knuckle sandwich. [grabs Mulan 
                by the shirt collar drawing back his other arm. Mulan hides her 
                face withher hands. Ling looks away, closes his eyes, and puts 
                his fingers in his ears so that he wont hear anything]</p>
              <p>All Soldiers [in agreement with Yao]: Yeah.</p>
              <p>Shang [loudly]: Soldiers! [The soldiers line up quicky. Shang 
                takes off his shirt and grabs a bow and quiver of arrows. Mulan 
                is dulyimpressed by Shang's physique] You will assemble swiftly 
                and silently every morning. [Shang walks down the line of soldiers] 
                Anyone whoacts otherwise will answer to me.</p>
              <p>Yao: Ooooo, tough guy.</p>
              <p>Shang [turning around with knocked arrow pointing towards Yao]: 
                Yao. [All recruits take a step back leaving Yao one step forward. 
                ShangPoints arrow skyward and shoots it into the top of a high 
                pole] Thank you for volunteering. Retrieve the arrow.</p>
              <p>Yao [bows to Shang]: I'll get that arrow pretty boy. And I'll 
                do it with my shirt on. [Yao prepares to leap onto that pole]</p>
              <p>Shang: One moment, you seem to be missing something. [Chi Fu 
                brings out two large bronze disks. Shang takes out one disk and 
                holds ithigh speaking to all the troops] This represents discipline 
                [Shang hands the weight to Yao and the weight falls to the ground 
                taking Yao'sarm with it] and this represents strength [Shang hands 
                the other weight to Yao making him fall to the ground. The troops 
                laugh whileMulan looks concerned]. You need both to reach the 
                arrow.</p>
              <p>[Yao climbs up the pole then slips down under the weight. Ling, 
                Chien-Po, and Mulan each take their turn and fall down. Mulan 
                rubs herbehind as she walks away in front of Shang]</p>
              <p>Shang: We've got a long way to go.</p>
              <p>[Song I'll Make a Man Out of You]</p>
              <p>[Shang throws staffs to the soldiers. Yao intercepts Mulan's 
                staff and trips her with it]</p>
              <p>Shang:Let's get down to business--to defeat the Huns.</p>
              <p>[Shang throws up two clay pots and breaks them apart with his 
                staff. The troops are highly impressed]</p>
              <p>Recruits [putting their staffs out at arms length, spoken]: Hua</p>
              <p>Shang:Did they send me daughters when I asked for sons? [Ling 
                puts a cricket down Mulan's back causing her to flail erratically]You're 
                the saddest bunch I ever met [Most soldiers fall as Mulan moves 
                uncontrollably]But you can bet before we're through [Shang does 
                a somersault in the air landing near Mulan. He takes a pole in 
                the stomach. Shang stops Mulan andtakes her staff. He grabs her 
                by the collar]Mister, I'll make a man out of you </p>
              <p>[Shang steps on a lever throwing up 3 targets which he hits with 
                3 arrows from one bow]Tranquil as a forest[The recruits try and 
                fail. Mulan gets ready to fire when Mushu sticks a target on her 
                arrow before she shoots. Mulan looks at Mushu's inshock and pauses. 
                Shang looks disdainfully at Mulan as she cracks a huge smile]But 
                on fire within[Shang balances a bucket of water on his head holding 
                a staff. The recruits fire stones at him which Shang deflect with 
                the staff]Once you find your centerYou are sure to win[Mulan wobbles 
                with the bucket of water on her head. As the recruits throw stones 
                at her the bucket tips over onto her head]You're a spineless, 
                pale,pathetic lot And you haven't got a clue [Shang throws his 
                hand down into a river and retrieves a fish. Mulan throws her 
                hand down into the river and retrieve's Yao's foot. Mushucomes 
                out of the water with a fish in hand to give to Mulan]Somehow 
                I'll make a manout of you!</p>
              <p>Chien-Po [running through a field of fire arrows]:I'm never gonna 
                catch my breath</p>
              <p>Yao [following Chien-Po, falls and gets hit in the butt with 
                an arrow]:Say good-bye to those who knew me</p>
              <p>Ling [Banging his head on a stone slab]:Boy I was a fool in school 
                for cutting gym</p>
              <p>[Shang practices martial arts with Mulan. With a punch to the 
                face he knocks her back into a tree]</p>
              <p>Mushu [from the tree acts as a boxing coach]:This guy's got 'em 
                scared to death</p>
              <p>Mulan [Mushu pushes Mulan back out into the ring]:Hope he doesn't 
                see right through me</p>
              <p>Chien-Po [stops as he's hopping across poles protruding from 
                water causing Shang and the recruits to pile into him]:Now I really 
                wish that I knew how to swim!</p>
              <p>Shang and Chorus: [Cannon fire misses the target in the middle 
                of an open field. Ling kicks the support structure out from Mulan's 
                cannon and it begins to fall.Mulan quickly grabs the cannon and 
                it fires high and back towards the camp landing and exploding

                camp from the hill not looking pleased]Mysterious as the dark 
                side of the moon </p>
              <p>Shang [his troops laden with poles on their shoulders carrying 
                bags of grain - one on each side. They march up a mountain]:Time 
                is racing toward us till the Huns arrive [Chi Fu points Shang's 
                eyes back to a struggling Mulan who falls to the ground. Cri-Kee 
                and Mushu try to pick her up but hide when Shangcomes up to her. 
                Shang picks up her pole with grain, puts it on top of his and 
                returns to the troops. Mulan looks rejected]Heed my every order 
                and you might survive[Shang hand the reigns of Khan to Mulan]You're 
                unsuited for the rage of warSo pack up, go home, you're throughHow 
                could I make a manout of you?</p>
              <p>Shang and Chorus [Mulan takes the weights and tries to climb 
                the pole again]:(Be a man)We must be swift as the coursing river[Mulan 
                ties the weights together behind the pole and uses the cloth to 
                help her shimmy up the pole](Be a man)With all the force of a 
                great typhoon[As the sun begins to rise the recruits come out 
                of their tents to cheer on Mulan](Be a man)With all the strength 
                of a raging fire[As Shang comes out of his tent, the arrow he 
                shot up onto the pole comes down to his feet. He looks up and

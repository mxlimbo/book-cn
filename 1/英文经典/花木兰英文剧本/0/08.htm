          <tr>
            <td>Shan-Yu: Boo. [Shan-Yu steps into the balcony next to the Emperor] 
              [to Hun Bald Man #1 and #2] Guard the door [they walk off downthe 
              stairs that lead to the balcony]. [pacing around the Emperor] Your 
              walls and armies have fallen, and now it's your turn. Bow to me.
              <p>[Cut to the entrance to the stairwell that leads to the balcony. 
                Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 come down the stairs and close the door, 
                joiningHun Archer Man, Hun Strong Man and Hun Long-Hair Man. Mulan 
                and company are around the corner]</p>
              <p>Mulan [whispering]: Okay, any questions?</p>
              <p>Yao [whispering]: Does this dress make me look fat? [Mulan slaps 
                him] Ow.</p>
              <p>[Mulan, Yao, Ling and Chien-Po walk out smiling, giggling and 
                trying to act lady-like including holding fans and waving fans]</p>
              <p>Hun Archer: Who's there?</p>
              <p>Hun Bald Man #2 [putting down Hun Bald Man #1's sword]: Concubines.</p>
              <p>Hun Bald Man #1: Ugly concubines.</p>
              <p>Ling [waving daintily, speaking to Yao]: Oh he's so cute.</p>
              <p>[Hun Bald Man #2 smiles and waves back. Hun Bald Man #1 elbows 
                Hun Bald Man #2. A bitten apple falls out from beneath Ling'sdress. 
                He pulls the dress out and turns so as not to expose the loss 
                of figure]</p>
              <p>Shang [from around the corner putting his head down into his 
                hand]: Aww.</p>
              <p>[Shan-Yu's Falcon sees Shang and starts to squawk. Mushu from 
                above singes off all his feathers with his fire breathing]</p>
              <p>Mushu [to Cri-Kee sitting above him]: Now that's what I call 
                Mongolian Barbeque. [Cri-Kee rolls on his back in laughter. The 
                stunnedfalcon doesn't do anything]</p>
              <p>[Hun Bald Man #2 picks up the apple and offers it back to Ling. 
                Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po pull out the fruit they were using to 
                simulate awoman's chest. Chien-Po takes his watermelons and smashes 
                them on the heads of Hun Bald Man #1 and #2. He then smashes their 
                twoheads together and they fall to the ground. Ling pushes the 
                apple into Hun Long-Hair man's mouth and kicks him in the stomach 
                causingHun Long-Hair Man to stoop over on the ground. Ling uses 
                his head to crack Hun Long-Hair Man's back. Hun Strong Guy lunges 
                his fistat Yao and misses, he misses with the other. Yao grabs 
                the outstretched arm and flips him over onto his head. Mulan kicks 
                away HunArcher Man's bow and knocked arrow, avoids his strike 
                by turning her back to Hun Archer. She follows with a left elbow 
                to the stomachfollowed by a left upper cut knocking Hun Archer 
                to the ground. She sits on his back and uses the bow to pull his 
                head back]</p>
              <p>Mulan [calling out]: Shang, GO!</p>
              <p>[Shang runs out from behind the corner, charges through the door 
                and runs up the stairs]</p>
              <p>[Cut to Shan-Yu and the Emperor on the balcony]</p>
              <p>Shan-Yu: I tire of your arrogance old man. [yelling and putting 
                his sword at the emperor'sthroat] Bow to me!</p>
              <p>Emperor: No matter how the wind howls, the mountain cannot bow 
                to it.</p>
              <p>Shan-Yu: Then you will kneel in pieces. [Shan-Yu draws back his 
                sword to strike the Emperor]</p>
              <p>[Shang runs up in time to block the striking blow of Shan-Yu 
                with his sword. Shang swipes withhis sword. Shan-Yu grabs Shang's 
                arm and throws him towards the edge. Shang grabs onto a columnand 
                he flies over the edge and uses the momentum to swing back and 
                kick Shan-Yu. Shan-Yu fallsto the ground, Shang on top of him. 
                Shang punches Shan-Yu. Shan-Yu grabs Shang and rolls overforcing 
                Shang to be on his back underneath him. Shang uses his knee to 
                hit Shan-Yu from behindas he uses his hand to hit him in the head. 
                Shang forces Shan-Yu onto his back and grabs his armpulling it 
                behind Shan-Yu's back. Mulan, Chien-Po, Yao and Ling enter the 
                balcony from thestairs]</p>
              <p>Mulan: Chien-Po, get the Emperor.</p>
              <p>Chien-Po [standing in front of the Emperor and bowing]: Sorry, 
                your Majesty. </p>
              <p>[Chien-Po lifts up the Emperor and runs over to Mulan who is 
                by a rope attached to a column inthe balcony. Chien-Po uses his 
                sash as a pulley and rides down the rope to the ground. Shan Yuwatches 
                the Emperor leave]</p>
              <p>Shan-Yu: No! </p>
              <p> [Shan-Yu uses his free arm to elbow Shang in the face. Shan-Yu 
                gets up and head-butts Shang andthrows him to the ground. Shang 
                lies limp. Mulan watches Shang fall then she looks over theedge 
                at Ling and Yao now on the ground. Chien-Po runs off the screen 
                out of sight]</p>
              <p>Yao [motioning her to follow]: Come on!</p>
              <p>[Mulan looks down at Shang with a worried look. Shan-Yu begins 
                to approach Mulan and the rope. Mulan looks at the approaching 
                Shan-Yu and then down to spy his sword. Thinking quickly, Mulan 
                grabsShan-Yu's sword and cuts the taught rope. Shan-Yu reaches 
                the edge and grabs for the falling rope unsuccessfully as Mulan 
                leaves thesword embedded in the column and runs to Shang's position. 
                The crowd cheers]</p>
              <p>Shan-Yu: No! [He looks down at the crowd and realizes he cannot 
                find the Emperor among thethrong of people] Yrraaaaahhhh!</p>
              <p>[Shan-Yu turns and looks back and sees Mulan looking concerned, 
                holding up Shang. Shan-Yu pullsout his sword lodged in the column 
                and heads toward them. As Shang sees Shan-Yu approaching, heputs 
                his arm in front of Mulan to ask her to leave and takes out his 
                knife. Mulan slides away. Shan-Yu comes up to Shang, knocks away 
                his knife, slaps him in the face, and grabs Shang by theshirt 
                collar]</p>
              <p>Shan-Yu [in Shang's face]: You, you took away my victory.</p>
              <p>[Mulan's shoe hits Shan-Yu in the head and bounces back to her 
                feet. Shan-Yu turns toward Mulan]</p>
              <p>Mulan: No! I did! [Mulan pulls her hair back to look like she 
                did when she was a soldier]</p>
              <p>Shan-Yu [looking at Mulan]: The soldier from the mountains.</p>
              <p>[Shan-Yu drops Shang and starts after Mulan as she puts on her 
                shoe and runs down the stairs andthrough the doors to the balcony. 
                She closes the door with the latch falling in place rightbehind 
                her. She leans against the doors. Shan-Yu punches a hole in one 
                door with his fist. Mulan runs away from the doors down the corridor. 
                Mushu riding Shan-Yu's falcon like a horsecatches up with Mulan]</p>
              <p>Mushu: So what's the plan?</p>
              <p>Mulan: Ummmm.</p>
              <p>Mushu: You don't have a plan?!</p>
              <p>Mulan: Hey, I'm making this up as I...[looks out a window and 
                spies the firework tower] go. Mushu--</p>
              <p>Mushu: I'm way ahead of you sister. C'mon Cri-Kee. [Mushu and 
                Cri-Kee jump onto a kite and usethe wings to soar over toward 
                the fireworks tower]</p>
              <p>[Cut to Shan-Yu. Shan-Yu breaks through the doors and catches 
                up to Mulan swinging his swordwildly knocking down a support column 
                with every swipe. Mulan runs and ducks his every blow. Mulan climbs 
                up a column to get out of Shan-Yu's reach. Shan-Yu slices the 
                base of the columncausing it to fall and break through the outer 
                wall. Mulan screams as the beam falls and comesto a stop. Mulan 
                gets up on the beam and jumps up to catch onto the awning. She 
                looks off toher right and spies Mushu arriving at the fireworks 
                tower]</p>

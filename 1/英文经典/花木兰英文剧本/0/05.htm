              <p>[Cut to Shan Yu sitting on top of a tree. He cuts off the very 
                top with his sword. His falcon swoops buy and drops a doll. Shan-Yu 
                takesthe doll, sniffs it, looks surprised, and drops down to the 
                ground]</p>
              <p>Shan-Yu [tossing the doll to Hun Strong Man]: What do you see?</p>
              <p>Hun Strong Man [feeling the doll]: Black pine, from the high 
                mountains. [Long Hair Hun Man takes the doll from Hun Strong Man. 
                BaldHun Man #1 takes a hair as it passes by him]</p>
              <p>Bald Hun Man #1: White horse hair. Imperial stallions. </p>
              <p>Long Hair Hun Man [sniffing the doll]: Sulfur, from cannons.</p>
              <p>Shan-Yu: This doll came from a village in the Tung Shao Pass, 
                where the Imperial Army's waiting for us.</p>
              <p>Hun Archer: We can avoid them easily.</p>
              <p>Shan-Yu [shaking his head]: No, the quickest way to the Emperor 
                is through that pass. Besides, the little girl will be missing 
                her doll. Weshould return it to her.</p>
              <p>[End Interlude]</p>
              <p>[Cut to Mulan by the lake with Mushu, Khan, and Cri-Kee]</p>
              <p>Mushu: Hey, oh, ah, no, this is not a good idea. What if somebody 
                sees you?</p>
              <p>Mulan [from behind the reeds]: Just because I look like a man 
                doesn't mean I have to smell like one. </p>
              <p>Mushu [holding a towel covering his eyes with his ears]: So a 
                couple of guys don't rinse out their socks, picky, picky, picky. 
                Well myself Ikinda like that corn chip's smell.</p>
              <p>Mulan [running by Mushu and jumps into the lake splashing water 
                on Mushu]: Ahhhhhhh.</p>
              <p>Mushu: Okay, all right, all right, that's enough. Now, c'mon, 
                get out before you get all pruny and stuff [holding out a towel 
                towards Mulankeeping his eyes covered].</p>
              <p>Mulan: Mushu, if you're so worried, go stand watch.</p>
              <p>Mushu: Yeah, yeah, [walking in a womanly fashion speaking in 
                woman's voice] stand watch Mushu while I blow our secret with 
                my stupidgirly habits. [back to normal] Humph, hygiene.</p>
              <p>Cri-Kee [alarmed, tugging on Mushu's whiskers]: Chirp, Chirp.</p>
              <p>Yao: Me first! Me first! Me First! [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po run 
                by Mushu smacking him in the face with colored boxers]</p>
              <p>Mushu [gasps]: Ah. We're doomed! There a couple of things I know 
                they're bound to notice!</p>
              <p>[Yao and Ling jump into the water. Chien-Po dips in his toe to 
                check temperature then jumps in causing a large wave. Yao and 
                Ling ridethe wave towards Mulan. Mulan sees them and hides her 
                face behind a lily pad]</p>
              <p>Yao [calling]: Hey, Ping.</p>
              <p>[Mulan peeks over the lily pad and spreads it on the water covering 
                her chest]</p>
              <p>Mulan [speaking nervously and unnaturally in a manly voice]: 
                Oh hi guys, I didn't know you were *here*. [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po 
                share&quot;this boy is strange&quot; looks] I was just washing, 
                so now I'm clean and I'm gonna go. Bye, bye. [Mulan hides behind 
                a rock keeping her frontfacing the rock]</p>
              <p>Ling [from behind Mulan]: Come back here. I know we were jerks 
                to you before so lets start over. [extending his hand to shake 
                hands withMulan] Hi, I'm Ling!</p>
              <p>Mulan [covering her chest with her left arm, she turns and shakes 
                his hand with an outstretched right arm, smiling]: Heh, heh. [Mulan 
                turnsand wades away from Ling and runs into Chien-Po]</p>
              <p>Chien-Po [taking a lily pad off his head]: And I'm Chien-Po.</p>
              <p>Mulan [waving slightly and smiling]: Hello Chien-Po.</p>
              <p>[Yao stands on top of a rock looking down at the others. Mulan 
                looks down into the water and hides her eyes with her free hand]</p>
              <p>Yao: And I am Yao, king of the rock. And there's nothin' you 
                girls can do about it.</p>
              <p>Ling [taking a fighting stance]: Oh, yeah? Well, I think Ping 
                [elbowing Mulan] and I could take you.</p>
              <p>Mulan [wading away]: I really don't want to take him anywhere.</p>
              <p>Ling [following Mulan]: Ping, we have to fight!</p>
              <p>Mulan: No we don't. [unnaturally] We could just close our eyes 
                and swim around.</p>
              <p>Ling: C'mon don't be such a g--Ouch! Something bit me.</p>
              <p>Mushu [popping out of the water between Mulan and Ling]: What 
                a nasty flavor.</p>
              <p>Ling [with fear and gusto]: Snake! </p>
              <p>Chien-Po [while all three of them climb up the rock and on each 
                other]: Snake, snake.</p>
              <p>[Mulan whistles for Khan and wades back to shore. Khan comes 
                close enough to shore and Mulan hides behind Khan as she wraps 
                a towelaround her body]</p>
              <p>[Cut to Yao, Ling and Chien-Po calmed down sitting on the rock]</p>
              <p>Ling: Some king of the rock! [Yao pushes him off the rock]</p>
              <p>[Cut to Mulan with towel wrapped around her]</p>
              <p>Mulan: Boy, that was close.</p>
              <p>Mushu [brushing his teeth]: No, that was vile! You owe me big!</p>
              <p>Mulan: I never want to see a naked man again. [the rest of the 
                troops run by naked and jump into the lake]</p>
              <p>Mushu: Hey, don't look at me. I ain't biting any more butts.</p>
              <p>[Cut to Mulan outside Chi Fu's Tent having dressed fully. Chi 
                Fu and Shang are talking from inside]</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [fading in]: You think your troops are ready to fight? 
                Hah! They would not last a minute against the Huns. </p>
              <p>Shang: They completed their training.</p>
              <p>Chi Fu: Those *boys* are no more fit to be soldiers than you 
                are to be Captain. Once the general reads my report, your troops 
                will neversee battle.</p>
              <p>Mushu [from outside the tent]: Oh no you don't. I've worked to 
                hard to get Mulan into this war. [to Cri-Kee] This guy's messing 
                with myplan.</p>
              <p>Shang [grabbing onto the front of Chi Fu's clip board]: We're 
                not finished.</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [pulling the board away]: Be careful, Captain. The General 
                may be your father, but I am the Emperor's council. And, oh, by 
                theway, huh, I got that job on my own. [opens the entrance to 
                the tent for Shang] You're dismissed.</p>
              <p>[Shang storms out of the tent and starts to walk by Mulan]</p>
              <p>Mulan [in a manly voice]: Hey, I'll hold him and you punch, heh, 
                heh... [Shang walks by without reacting] or not. [calling out 
                to Shang] For what it's worth, I think you're a great captain. 
                [Shang pauses to glance back, then continues forward]</p>
              <p>Mushu [looking at Mulan's fixed gaze on Shang]: I saw that!</p>
              <p>Mulan [innocently]: What?</p>
              <p>Mushu [teasing]: You like him don't you?</p>
              <p>Mulan: No, I--</p>
              <p>Mushu: Yeah right, Yeah sure. Look, [pointing to Mulan's tent] 
                go to your tent. [Mulan walks away with a look of delight. Mushu 
                talks toCri-Kee] I think it's time we took this war into our own 
                hands [rubbing hands together].</p>
              <p>[Mushu and Cri-Kee wait outside Chi Fu's Tent. Chi Fu emerges 
                with carrying a scrub brush and wrapped in a towel and with bigshowering 
                slippers on his feet. He whistles as he walks off. Mushu and Cri-Kee 
                enter his tent. Cri-Kee uses his legs to write up a letter. Hefinishes 
                and Mushu takes the paper]</p>
              <p>Mushu: Okay, okay, let me see what you've got. From General Li, 
                dear son, we're waiting for the huns at the pass and it would 
                mean a lotif you'd come and back us up. [sarcastically] That's 
                great except you forgot, &quot;and since we're all out of potpourri, 
                maybe you wouldn'tmind bringing up some.&quot; Hellooooo, this 
                is the army! Make it sound more urgent, please! You know what 
                I'm talkin' about? [Cri-Kee startswriting the note again] That's 
                better, much better. [taking the note] Okay, Let's go.</p>
              <p>[Cut to Khan drinking water from the trough. Mushu is on his 
                back]</p>
              <p>Mushu: Khan-ie baby, hey, we need a ride. [Khan squirts Mushu 
                off his back with water from his mouth]</p>
              <p>[Cut to Chi Fu walking out of the lake wrapped in a towel, sounds 
                of laughter can be heart from the troops]</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [muttering]: Insubordinate ruffians. [then calling to 
                the troops] You men owe me a new pair of slippers. And I do not 
                squeal like agirl. [a panda bear chomps down on the slipper Chi 
                Fu is holding] Aaaaaahhhhhh!</p>
              <p>Mushu [sitting on top of the panda bear behind a dummy of a soldier 
                using sticks to gesticulate with the dummy's arms to push the 
                notetowards Chi Fu. Cri-Kee works the mouth]: Urgent news from 
                the general! [Chi Fu looks over the panda] What's the matter, 
                you've neverseen a 'black and white' before?</p>
              <p>Chi Fu: Who are you?</p>
              <p>Mushu: Excuse me! I think the question is: who are you? We're 
                in a war man! There's no time for stupid questions. I should have 
                yourhat for that, [the panda starts walking forward] snatch it 
                right off of your head [swiping with an arm at Chi Fu's hat. Mushu 
                turns the upperhalf of the dummy around after the panda passes 
                Chi Fu. Chi Fu begins reading the message]. But I'm feeling gracious 
                today, so carry onbefore I report you. [the panda walks up a tree 
                taking Mushu and Cri-Kee with him out of sight]</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [looking around for Mushu but not finding him, then runs 
                into Shang's tent]: Captain. Urgent news from the General. We're 
                neededat the front.</p>
              <p>Mushu [from up in the tree]: Pack your bags Cri-Kee, we're movin' 
                out. [Cri-Kee high fives Mushu]</p>
              <p>[Song: A Girl Worth Fighting For]</p>
              <p>Army Chorus [troops walking up hill]:For a long time we've been 
                marching off to battle</p>
              <p>Yao [close-up of Yao, then a shot of 2 cows]: In a thundering 
                herd we feel a lot like cattle</p>
              <p>Cow [spoken]: Moo</p>
              <p>Army Chorus [showing troops marching]:Like the pounding beat 
                our aching feet aren't easy to ignore</p>
              <p>Ling [catching up to Yao and Chien-Po]:Hey, think of instead,A 
                girl worth fighting for [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po look upwards dreamily]</p>
              <p>Mulan [spoken from behind]: Huh?</p>
              <p>Ling [grabbing Mulan and drawing her close while pulling out 
                a centerfold]:That's what I said, a girl worth fighting for [Mulan 
                runs away seeing the centerfold]</p>
              <p>[artistry section where the images are drawn like painted people. 
                Ling is seen looking at a woman and then kissing her]I want her 
                paler than the moon with eyes that shine like stars</p>
              <p>Yao [lifting and lowering a woman over his head then opening 
                his chest to show a gaping wound that we can see the woman through]:My 
                girl will marvel at my strength, adore my battle scars</p>
              <p>Chien-Po [Chien-Po and a woman circle around then land on the 
                edge of a large bowl of rice as a cow, pig and chicken fall beside 
                them]:I couldn't care less what she'll wear or what she looks 
                likeIt all depends on what she cooks like:Beef, pork, chicken... 
                [end painted people section, the last image fades into statues 
                that the troops just passed]</p>
              <p>All Three:Mmm...</p>
              <p>Yao [looking at Mulan while crossing the river with swords over 
                their heads. Mulan looks disgusted and hurries forward]:Bet the 
                local girls thought you were quite the charmer</p>
              <p>Ling [with armor full of water to make him look muscular]:And 
                I'll bet the ladies love a man in armor [the water leaks out making 
                Ling look like his normal self]</p>
              <p>Army Chorus [Mushu whistles to ladies working in the rice field 
                from out of the carriage holding cannons. Cri-Kee looks shocked. 
                Theladies look and giggle at Mulan who hides her face]:You can 
                guess what we have missed the most since we went off to warWhat 
                do we want?A girl worth fighting for!</p>
              <p>Yao [Mulan walks away from Yao and into Chien-Po]:My girl will 
                think I have no faults</p>
              <p>Chien-Po:That I'm a major find</p>
              <p>Mulan [Caught between Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po who all look up 
                dreamily waiting for her ideal woman. She is forced to speak (sing)]:[spoken] 
                Uh, [singing] How about a girl who's got a brain, [Yao starts 
                to look unimpressed]Who always speaks her mind? [Mulan shrugs 
                her shoulders]</p>
              <p>Ling, Yao and Chien-Po [disdainfully, looking disappointed and 
                disgusted]: Nah!</p>
              <p>Ling [grabbing Mulan's shoulder and leaning on her, she takes 
                his hand off and shakes her head disapprovingly. Ling leans against 
                thecarriage of cannons]:My manly ways and turns of phrase are 
                sure to thrill her</p>
              <p>Yao [hitting Khan so that the carriage runs out from under Ling. 
                Ling looks upset then falls in the mud]:He thinks he's such a 
                lady-killer!</p>
              <p>Chi Fu:I've a girl back home who's unlike any other.</p>
              <p>Yao [aside to Mulan]:Yeah, the only girl who'd love him is his 
                mother! [Mulan smiles]</p>
              <p>Army Men [lining up locking arms across each others shoulders 
                with Mulan in the middle to her discontent]:But when we come home 
                in victory they'll line up at the door!</p>
              <p>Ling [sitting on top of Chien-Po]:What do we want?</p>
              <p>Army Chorus:A girl worth fighting for!</p>
              <p>Ling:Wish that I had</p>
              <p>Army Chorus [Mulan breaks away and walks in the opposite direction 
                of the army]:A girl worth fighting for!(whistle) [Mulan sees Ling, 
                Yao, and Chien-Po with snowballs about to pelt her so she turns 
                around] A girl worth fighting--</p>

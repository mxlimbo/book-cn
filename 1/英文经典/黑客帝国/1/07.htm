              EXT. EL TRAIN</p>
            <p> An EL TRAIN RAGES against its metal rails.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. TRAIN</p>
            <p> It is three a.m., and the train carries the usual urban<br>
              night crawlers. Neo sits alone, eyes shifting, watching<br>
              everything nervously.</p>
            <p> There is a METAL BANG and TRAIN CLATTER fills the car as<br>
              the door is opened.</p>
            <p> Neo turns and sees a large man enter. He is wearing<br>
              sunglasses and a black leather jacket. His name is APOC<br>
              and he walks straight at Neo.</p>
            <p> APOC<br>
              Come with me.</p>
            <p> Neo stands just as the door at the opposite end opens and<br>
              two police officers rush in, drawing their guns.</p>
            <p> Apoc grabs Neo, muscling him to the nearest exit. There<br>
              is no upcoming station.</p>
            <p> Apoc yanks the emergency brake and the train buckles<br>
              against its own speed. The cops are thrown back. Neo<br>
              slams against the metal rail.</p>
            <p> The doors open onto nothing and just when Neo regains his<br>
              balance, Apoc shoves him backwards --</p>
            <p> He flies out from the train, arms windrilling as he falls<br>
              from, the raised tracks --</p>
            <p> Hurtling towards a busy city street when, out of nowhere,<br>
              a truck races under him and --</p>
            <p> He crashes into a large dumpster-bed filled with empty<br>
              boxes.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. TRUCK BED</p>
            <p> Still shaking his head, Neo realizes he is not alone. A<br>
              man named Cabie is aiming a big gun at him. Trinity is<br>
              next to him, talking into a cellular phone.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              We got him. Call the chop-shop.</p>
            <p> She hangs up.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Listen to me, Neo. You have to,<br>
              trust us.</p>
            <p> She tears off a long strip of black duct-tape and reaches<br>
              for his face.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What are you doing?</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              This has to be done for your protection and ours.</p>
            <p> She seals his eyes shut with the tape.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              You can't understand right now, but if you're not one of us,<br>
              you're one of them.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. LOWER WACKER</p>
            <p> A featureless black van glides up to a staircase that<br>
              curls down from the city's surface.</p>
            <p> trinity guides the blind Neo down the steps. The back of<br>
              the van slaps open, revealing a young, skinny man who<br>
              looks to be still in his teens, wearing an outfit that is<br>
              a cross between a surgeon and a telephone repair man.</p>
            <p> His name is GIZMO and he smiles lewdly at Trinity,<br>
              exposing his teeth that are wired with weird-looking<br>
              braces.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              Va va va voom. Still the hottest software around.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Hello, Gizmo.</p>
            <p> Neo hears the voices around him.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              This is really the guy? The guy that Morpheus thinks --</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Yeah.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              But he's so old.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Are you going to help us or aren't you?</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              Hacksaw. Load up the copper-top and let's get the hell outta here.</p>
            <p> Hacksaw is a huge man in a leather welder's apron. He<br>
              shoulders Neo and hauls him into the van.</p>
            <p> A moment later the green lights of Lower Wacker curve<br>
              over the tinted windshield as the van rushes through the<br>
              underworld.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN</p>
            <p> The chop-shop is filled with electronic gadgets, wired to<br>
              meters and monitors. There are shelves lined with<br>
              medical supplies and rows of hanging tools, knives,<br>
              cleavers, and stainless steel clamps.</p>
            <p> Neo is strapped down to an ambulance cart, listening<br>
              nervously as Gizmo gets to work.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              Okay, first we take a little look under the hood.</p>
            <p> He pulls up the goggles hanging at his neck and they<br>
              blink to life with tiny halogen lights and lenses irising<br>
              to varying levels of magnification.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              You're going to feel a little prick.</p>
            <p> He inserts acupuncture-like needles into Neo's lower<br>
              abdomen. The needles are wired to video monitors.<br>
              Hacksaw pilots the fiber-optic lens.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What are you doing?</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              We think you're bugged. We can't take you to Morpheus<br>
              until you're clean.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              There it is.</p>
            <p> On a monitor, we see the bug nestled in among Neols large<br>
              intestines.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              Hit him with 10 ccs of local.</p>
            <p> Hacksaw loads a hypodermic needle and pumps an anesthetic<br>
              around Neols navel.</p>
            <p> Using a device that looks like a miniature speculum,<br>
              Gizmo inserts a knuckled dental pick. Typing into a<br>
              calculator keypad wired to the pick, he automates the<br>
              tip.</p>
            <p> On the monitor, we watch it telescope out and the end<br>
              separate into a tiny hooked, metal claw.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.</p>
            <p> The claw snags hold of the bug.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              Gotcha!</p>
            <p> But the bug reacts violently. Neo screams as it wraps<br>
              itself around the soft tissue web of intestine.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              Shit.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              What's happening?</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              I don't know. They've never done that before.</p>
            <p> Neo writhes in pain.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              Hold him down.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Jesus! God!</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Do something!</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              I got it! Maybe we can stun it.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Are you crazy? That will kill him.</p>
            <p> We watch Neo, who can't see what they are talking about.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              It'll work. Come on, do it or Hacksaw will.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Do what?</p>
            <p> The instant he hears the word, he knows.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Clear.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Oh, shit --</p>
            <p> The cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his<br>
              chest. Gizmo wrestles with the bug.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              Hit him again!</p>
            <p> Again, the electricity convulses through him as Gizmo<br>
              yanks the speculum out.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              Got it!</p>
            <p> Trinity touches Neo, who is just beginning to breathe.<br>
              She eases the tape off his eyes.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Neo, are you okay?</p>
            <p> He nods.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              It's over. We got it.</p>
            <p> Hanging from the claw pick is the inanimate metal wire-<br>
              tap.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              Nasty little bugger, ain't it?</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE</p>
            <p> The van stops in a deserted alley behind a forgotten<br>
              hotel. The doors open and Trinity helps Neo get out.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Thanks for your help, Gizmo.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              I just hope the man knows what<br>
              he's doing.</p>
            <p> She nods then climbs out of the van. Gizmo ogles the<br>
              tight leather pants.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              Goddamn, what I wouldn't give for<br>
              a copy of that software.</p>
            <p> Trinity turns around.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Gizmo, you don't have the hardware<br>
              to handle this software.</p>
            <p> He howls with adolescent laughter as the van pulls away.<br>
              Trinity turns to Neo.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Let's go. He's waiting.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE</p>
            <p> It is a place of putrefying elegance, a rotting host of<br>
              urban maggotry.</p>
            <p> Trinity leads Neo from the stairwell down the hall of the<br>
              thirteenth floor. They stop outside room 1313.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              This is it.</p>
            <p> Neo can hear his own heart pounding.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Let me give one piece of advice. Be honest. He knows more than you 
              can possibly imagine.</p>
            <p></p>

              EXT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Cuff ed and beaten, Morpheus is thrown into a caged<br>
              transport vehicle. The DOOR CLANGS shut.</p>
            <p> Agent Jones finds Agent Smith.</p>
            <p> AGENT JONES<br>
              The others were lost.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              You've taken care of Reagan?</p>
            <p> Agent Jones nods.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Then the others do not matter.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> A manhole cover cracks open. Two eyes peek out just as a<br>
              TRUCK RATTLES over it. The THUNDER DOPPLERS AWAY and the cover opens.</p>
            <p> Neo, Trinity, Switch and Apoc climb out. Trinity pulls a<br>
              water-logged phone from her pocket.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              We need a phone.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Tank is again at the monitors, searching the Matrix.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              We gotta find the others. They're still alive.</p>
            <p> The PHONE RINGS.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Operator.</p>
            <p> CYPHER (V.O.)<br>
              I need an exit! Fast!</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Cypher? I thought they had you?</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Cypher is standing at a public phone. Across the street<br>
              is the burning paddy wagon that appears to have collided<br>
              witli an oncoming car.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              There was an accident. A fucking<br>
              car accident. All of a sudden.<br>
              Boom. They're all dead. I still<br>
              got the shakes but, Jesus,<br>
              someone's going to make a believer<br>
              out of me.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Dozer spots the wreck.</p>
            <p> DOZER<br>
              There he is.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              I got you.</p>
            <p> CYPHER (V.O.)<br>
              Just get me outta here.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> TANK (V.O.)<br>
              Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie.<br>
              An old appliance store.</p>
            <p> Cypher hangs up and smiles as the fire trucks arrive.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              An actor. Definitely.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> The PHONE RINGS. Tank answers.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Operator.</p>
            <p> TRINITY (V.O.)<br>
              Tank, it's me.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> They are outside a pawn shop. Trinity has a new cellular.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              We need an exit!</p>
            <p> TANK (V.O.)<br>
              Gotcha. You're not far from Cypher.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Cypher, I thought --</p>
            <p> TANK (V.O.)<br>
              So did we. That boy's got nine lives. I sent him to Franklin and<br>
              Erie.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Got it.</p>
            <p> She hangs up.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Running, Cypher turns onto Erie.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Dead machines, eviscerated and shrouded with dust lay on<br>
              metal shelves like bodies in a morgue.</p>
            <p> Plywood covering a small window is ripped off and Cypher<br>
              crawls inside.</p>
            <p> Deep in the back room, a PHONE that has not rung in years<br>
              begins to RING.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Tank punches the emit command.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Got him.</p>
            <p> Cypher's body twitches in its harness, jerking itself<br>
              awake. His eyes blink open. Dozer unplugs him.</p>
            <p> DOZER<br>
              System check looks fine.</p>
            <p> Cypher stands, a raspy cough spewing from his lungs.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Trinity sees the appliance shop.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Cypher holds his chest.</p>
            <p> DOZER<br>
              You okay?</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              Goddamn gas. My lungs are killing<br>
              me.</p>
            <p> He crosses to an overhead bin.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              We got any pain killers?</p>
            <p> DOZER<br>
              The first aid kit's over here.</p>
            <p> As Dozer stoops for a cabinet, Cypher pulls back a heavy<br>
              blanket exposing a plasma rifle.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Neo crawls through the window that Cypher opened.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Tank finishes loading the exit programs as Cypher rises<br>
              behind him, swinging the weapon at his back.</p>
            <p> He looks over as Dozer turns with the first aid kit, a<br>
              look of frozen disbelief crossing his face --</p>
            <p> DOZER<br>
              No!</p>
            <p> Tank spins as red hot wads of PLASMA EXPLODE through his<br>
              chair and into his back. Diving, a second BURST tears up<br>
              his side --</p>
            <p> As Dozer shoots a look at the monitor where Tank was<br>
              working. He stabs the enter command activating the exit<br>
              sequence and ducks under a BARRAGE of PLASMA FIRE-</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> The PHONE begins to RING as the others crawl in.</p>
            <p> SWITCH<br>
              God, I love that sound.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Dozer rolls up, grabbing a heavy crowbar from a box of<br>
              tools.</p>
            <p> Cypher circles the drive chairs as the sights of the<br>
              plasma rifle find Dozer's face.</p>
            <p> Dozer charges, screaming, and the PLASMA RIFLE SCREAMS<br>
              back.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> The PHONE is still RINGING.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              You first,.Neo.</p>
            <p> Neo answers the phone when there is a CLICK. There is no<br>
              signal. Nothing but silence.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              What happened?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I don't know. It just went dead.</p>
            <p> Trinity listens to the dead line and takes out the<br>
              cellular.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> The operator PHONE begins to RING- Cypher steps over the<br>
              body of Tank and looks at the monitor.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Trinity can almost feel him watching them. Every<br>
              unanswered RING wrings her gut a little tighter, until --</p>
            <p> CYPHER (V.O.)<br>
              Hello, Trinity.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Cypher? Where's Tank?</p>
            <p> CYPHER (V.O.)<br>
              He had an accident.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              An accident? What about Dozer?<br>
              Is Dozer there?</p>

              EXT. SKYSCRAPER</p>
            <p> The downtown office of CorTechs, a software development<br>
              company.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. CORTECHS OFFICE</p>
            <p> The main offices are along each wall, the windows<br>
              overlooking downtown Chicago.</p>
            <p> RHINEHEART, the ultimate company man, lectures Neo<br>
              without looking at him, typing at his computer<br>
              continuously.</p>
            <p> Neo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding<br>
              outside, dragging their rubber squeegees down across the<br>
              surface of the glass.</p>
            <p> RHINEHEART<br>
              You have a problem, Mr. Anderson.<br>
              You think that you're special.<br>
              You believe that somehow the rules do not apply to you.</p>
            <p> He stops, glancing over his glasses at Neo, who turns in<br>
              time.</p>
            <p> RHINEHEART<br>
              Obviously, you are mistaken.</p>
            <p> His long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard.</p>
            <p> RHINEHEART<br>
              This company is one of the top software companies in the world<br>
              because every single employee understands that they are a part<br>
              of a whole. Thus, if an employee has a problem, the company has 
              a<br>
              problem.</p>
            <p> He turns again.</p>
            <p> RHINEHEART<br>
              The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson. Either you<br>
              choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth, or you choose 
              to find yourself another job. Do I make myself clear?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Yes, Mr. Rhineheart. Perfectly<br>
              clear.</p>
            <p> INT. NEO'S CUBICLE</p>
            <p> The entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a<br>
              labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of<br>
              elevators.</p>
            <p> Neo slumps down into his chair. A TALL EMPLOYEE stands<br>
              up in the adjacent cubicle, leaning over the partition.</p>
            <p> TALL EMPLOYEE<br>
              What did he say?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              If I was late again, I'm going to be fired.</p>
            <p> He smirks.</p>
            <p> TALL EMPLOYEE<br>
              Well, it was nice working with you.</p>
            <p> Neo glares at him, as he sinks down.</p>
            <p> VOICE (O.S.)<br>
              Thomas Anderson?</p>
            <p> Neo turns and finds a FEDERAL EXPRESS MAN at his cubicle<br>
              door.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Yeah. That's me.</p>
            <p> Neo signs the electronic pad and the Fedex guy hands him<br>
              the softpak.</p>
            <p> FEDEX<br>
              Have a nice day.</p>
            <p> He opens the bag. Inside is a CELLULAR PHONE. It seems<br>
              the instant it is in his hand, it RINGS. Unnerved, he<br>
              flips it open.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Hello?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              Hello, Neo. This is Morpheus.</p>
            <p> Neo's knees give and he falls into his chair.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              I had hoped for this conversation to take place under less adverse<br>
              conditions, but you can never count on hope, can you, Neo?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              ... no.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              I've been watching you, Neo, and I want to meet you. I don't know 
              if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, 
              we have run out of time. They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not<br>
              sure what they're going to do.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Who's coming for me?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              Stand up and see for yourself.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Right now?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              Yes. Now.</p>
            <p> Neo starts to stand.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              Do it slowly. Slowly. The elevator.</p>
            <p> His head slowly peeks up over the partition.</p>
            <p> At the elevator, he sees Agent Brown and Agent Jones<br>
              leading a group of cops. A female employee turns and<br>
              points out Neo's cubicle.</p>
            <p> Neo ducks.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Holy fuckin' shit!</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> One cop stays at the elevator, the others follow the agents.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What the fuck do they want with me?!</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              I'm not sure. But, if you don't want to find out, you better get<br>
              out of there.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              How?!</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.</p>
            <p> The agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              The cubicle across from you is empty.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              But what if...?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              Go! Now!</p>
            <p> Neo lunges across the hall, diving into the other cubicle<br>
              just as the agents turn into his row.</p>
            <p> Neo crams himself into a dark corner, clutching the phone<br>
              tightly to him.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              Stay here for a moment.</p>
            <p> The agents enter Neo's empty cubicle. A cop is sent to<br>
              search the bathroom.</p>
            <p> Morpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              A little longer...</p>
            <p> Brown is talking to the tall employee.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              When I tell you, go to the end of the row to the first office on 
              the<br>
              left, stay.as low as you can.</p>
            <p> Sweat trickles down his forehead.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              Now.</p>
            <p> Neo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he<br>
              freezes right behind a cop who has just turned around.</p>
            <p> Staying crouched, he sneaks away, down the row, SHOOTING<br>
              across the opening to the first office on the left.</p>
            <p> The room is empty.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              Good. Now there is a window. Open it.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              How do you know all this?</p>
            <p> Morpheus laughs quietly.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              The answer is coming, Neo.</p>
            <p> He opens the window. The window howls into the room.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              Outside, there's a scaffold. You can use it to get to the roof.</p>
            <p> Leaning out the window, he sees that the scaffold is<br>
              several offices away.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              No! It's too far away.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              There's a small ledge. It's a<br>
              short climb. You can make it.</p>
            <p> Neo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a<br>
              concrete chasm.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              No way, no way, this is crazy.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              Don't be controlled by your fear, Neo. There are only two ways out<br>
              of this building. One is that scaffold. The other is in their<br>
              custody. You take a chance either way. I leave it to you.</p>
            <p> CLICK. He hangs up. Neo looks at the door, then back at<br>
              the scaffold.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              This is insane! Why is this happening to me? What did I do?<br>
              I'm nobody. I didn't do anything. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!</p>
            <p> He climbs up onto the window ledge. Hanging onto the<br>
              frame, he steps onto the small ledge.</p>
            <p> The scaffold seems even farther away.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I'm going to die.</p>
            <p> The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building,<br>
              knocking Neo off balance. Recoiling, he clings harder to<br>
              the frame, and the phone falls out of his hand.</p>
            <p> He watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              This is insane. I can't do this!<br>
              Forget it!</p>
            <p> He climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the<br>
              door.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I didn't do anything!</p>
            <p></p>

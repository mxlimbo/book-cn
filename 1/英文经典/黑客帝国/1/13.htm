              EXT. CHICAGO (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> An El train.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> The room is empty, heavy curtains covering windows. It<br>
              looks as if it hasn't been touched in years. In the<br>
              bedroom with the cracked oval mirror an old black PHONE<br>
              begins to RING.</p>
            <p> In the mirror, we first glimpse them and as we keep<br>
              TURNING, the room fills with equipment and the team.</p>
            <p> Morpheus answers the phone.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              We're in.</p>
            <p> He hangs up.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Mouse and Cable hold the exit.<br>
              Let's go.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Neo follows the others down the stairwell that winds<br>
              around an antique elevator shaft.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Did you have to do this?</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Yeah.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What did she tell you?</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Lots of things.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Any of them true?</p>
            <p> Trinity looks at him, then looks away.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Some of them.</p>
            <p> GIZMO<br>
              Were they good or bad?</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              There's no point in worrylng. Whatever is going to happen is<br>
              going to happen.</p>
            <p> They cross the old lobby. Switch and Apoc stop at the<br>
              doors.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              We should be back in an hour.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Neo squints into the sun that seems unnaturally bright.<br>
              He is the only one without sunglasses.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Do you now understand what it<br>
              means when we say, if you're not<br>
              one of us, you're one of them?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              The agents. They're sentient<br>
              programs. They can commandeer any<br>
              software hardwired to the<br>
              mainframe.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Anyone that is still in a power<br>
              plant. That is why we try to be<br>
              invisible in the Matrix.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              The best hacking is always traceless.</p>
            <p> Cypher and Trinity move away from them, securing the<br>
              perimeter. As Cypher passes a garbage can, he<br>
              surreptitiously drops something inside.</p>
            <p> It is a cellular phone and we watch the blue display as<br>
              the LINE CONNECTS.</p>
            <p> An early 1970s, black Lincoln Continental emerges from a<br>
              corrugated roll-up garage. Morpheus and Neo get in.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. LINCOLN CONTINENTAL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> An enormous man is waiting for them. A wad of chewing<br>
              tobacco bulges his cheek. He spits into a Coke can.</p>
            <p> MOJO<br>
              Morpheus, been a long time coming.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              You're looking well, Mojo.</p>
            <p> Mojo coughs a brown, cankerous laugh, juice speckling his<br>
              chin and shirt. He stares at Neo.</p>
            <p> MOJO<br>
              You bringing us geriatrics now. Morpheus?</p>
            <p> He spits and laughs again.</p>
            <p> MOJO<br>
              Guess you are locking for a miracle.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. BAR (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> The Continental pulls up to a bar in the kind of<br>
              neighborhood where every corner has a pair of eyes.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. BAR (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> A lightless, lower-class bar. No one enters that is not<br>
              expected.</p>
            <p> The front doors open in a brilliant burst of sunlight as<br>
              Mojo leads Morpheus and Neo inside. Neo looks around,<br>
              his eyes adjusting to the darkness.</p>
            <p> Mojo talks to the bartender, then looks over.</p>
            <p> MOJO<br>
              All right, it's cool. Go on back.</p>
            <p> They weave their way to the back of the bar, the STICKY<br>
              FLOOR SNAPPING under their FEET.</p>
            <p> A monolith of a man rises from his stool as they walk up.</p>
            <p> REX<br>
              You're late.</p>
            <p> He moves to the side, opening the heavy iron door behind<br>
              him. They descend the basement staircase toward the<br>
              single bare bulb at the bottom, hanging above the only<br>
              door.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> A high-tech laptop and modem are set up on a stack of<br>
              milk crates. Neo waits as Morpheus types in a series of<br>
              access codes. After a moment the screen blinks, &quot;Welcome<br>
              Morpheus.&quot;</p>
            <p> Morpheus walks back to the same door they entered, but it<br>
              now leads into --</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. TEMPLE OF ZION (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> The walls and floors are polished marble. Neo follows,<br>
              his mouth agape.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What -- what happened?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              This is the temple. It is a part of Zion's mainframe. It's hidden<br>
              inside the Matrix so that we can access it.</p>
            <p> Two PRIESTESSES are waiting in the antechamber.</p>
            <p> PRIESTESS<br>
              Hello, Morpheus. We've been expecting you.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Okay, you're on your own. Go with<br>
              them.</p>
            <p> They take Neo by the arm, leading him down a hall into<br>
              another room.</p>
            <p> PRIESTESS<br>
              Wait here. Among the other Potentials.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ROOM OF POTENTIALS (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Neo enters and finally understands the attention given to<br>
              his age. The Potentials are all little children.</p>
            <p> The room feels at once like a Buddhist temple and a<br>
              kindergarten class. The children's heads are either<br>
              shaved or thick with dreadlocks. Some are playing,<br>
              others meditating or practicing their gift.</p>
            <p> Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet<br>
              blocks. A skinny BOY holds a SPOON which sways like a<br>
              blade of grass as he bends it with his rnind.</p>
            <p> Neo crosses to him, sits.</p>
            <p> The Boy smiles as Neo picks up a spoon and tries to<br>
              imitate him. Despite his best efforts, Neo cannot make<br>
              it bend.</p>
            <p> SPOON BOY<br>
              Your spoon does not bend because it is just that, a spoon. Mine<br>
              bends because there is no spoon, just my mind.</p>
            <p> Neo watches as it curls into a knot.</p>
            <p> SPOON BOY<br>
              Link yourself to the spoon. Become the spoon and bend<br>
              yourself.</p>
            <p> Neo nods, again holding up his spoon.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              There is no spoon. Right.</p>
            <p> He concentrates. The spoon begins to bend just as the<br>
              Priestess touches his shoulder.</p>
            <p> PRIESTESS<br>
              The Oracle will see you now.</p>
            <p> Spoon Boy smiles.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. SHRINE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Neo enters nervously. Beneath his feet is a path of the<br>
              zodiac leading to marbled stairs that rise to a dais and<br>
              a three-legged throne.</p>
            <p> The throne is empty.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Hello?</p>
            <p> A DISTANT FEMALE VOICE calls to him and he follows it up<br>
              the stairs. At the top of the dais, he smells something<br>
              cooking.</p>
            <p> Following the scent, he moves behind the pillars where he<br>
              finds an open door.</p>
            <p> VOICE (O.S.)<br>
              Just come on in.</p>
            <p> He walks through a vestibule where he sees a fabulous<br>
              moonstone headdress and velvet robes. A second door<br>
              leads into --</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ORACLE'S CHAMBERS (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> It looks like a suburban tract house.</p>
            <p> There is a lot of cozy furniture, a dining roon hutch<br>
              filled with china, shelves and tables crowded with<br>
              doilies, knick-knacks and ceramic brick-a-brack.</p>
            <p> Neo follows the plastic carpet runner to the kitchen.</p>
            <p> A WOMAN is huddled beside the oven, peering inside<br>
              through the cracked door.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Hello?</p>
            <p> ORACLE (WOMAN)<br>
              I know. You're Neo. Be right with you.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              You're the Oracle?</p>
            <p> ORACLE<br>
              Bingo. I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. It's really 
              a<br>
              relief. All that pomp and circumstances just plain tucker me<br>
              out. Almost done. Smell good, don't they?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Yeah.</p>
            <p> ORACLE<br>
              I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway. And<br>
              don't worry about the vase.</p>
            <p>NEO<br>
              What vase?</p>
            <p> He turns to look around and his elbow knocks a VASE from<br>
              the table. It BREAKS against the linoleum floor.</p>
            <p> ORACLE<br>
              The vase.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Shit, I'm sorry.</p>
            <p> She pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies and turns.<br>
              She is an older woman, wearing big oven mitts,<br>
              comfortable slacks and a print blouse. She looks like<br>
              someone's grandma.</p>
            <p> ORACLE<br>
              I said don't worry about it. I'll get one of my kids to fix it.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              How did you know...?</p>
            <p> She sets the cookie tray on a wooden hot-pad.</p>
            <p> ORACLE<br>
              What's really going to bake your noodle later on is, would you<br>
              still have broken it if I hadn't said anything.</p>
            <p> Smiling, she lights a cigarette.</p>
            <p> ORACLE<br>
              You're cuter than I thought. I see why she likes you.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Who?</p>
            <p> ORACLE<br>
              Not too bright, though.</p>
            <p> She winks.</p>
            <p> ORACLE<br>
              You know why Morpheus brought you to see me?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I think so.</p>
            <p> ORACLE<br>
              So? What do you think? You think you're the one?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I don't know.</p>
            <p> She gestures to a wooden plaque, the kind every grandma<br>
              has, except that the words are in Latin.</p>
            <p> ORACLE<br>
              You know what that means? It's Latin. Means, 'Know thyself.'</p>
            <p> She puts her cigarette down.</p>
            <p> ORACLE<br>
              Well, let's have a look at you.</p>
            <p> She widens his eyes, checks his ears, then feels the<br>
              glands in his neck.</p>
            <p> ORACLE<br>
              Open your mouth. Say, 'ahhh.'</p>
            <p> She nods then looks at his palms.</p>
            <p> ORACLE<br>
              Hmmm. You sure got the gift, but it's tricky. I'd say the bad news<br>
              is, you're not the one. Still got a lot to learn. Maybe next life.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What's the good news?</p>
            <p> ORACLE<br>
              Same as the bad news, you're not the one.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Is that it, then?</p>
            <p> ORACLE<br>
              No. Here.</p>
            <p> She picks up the tray of cooling cookies.</p>
            <p> ORACLE<br>
              You better take a cookie. Got a big day ahead of you.</p>
            <p> He eyes her, then takes a cookie.</p>
            <p> ORACLE<br>
              Make a believer out of you yet.</p>

              INT. ANTECHAMBER (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Morpheus rises from a bench as the Priestess escorts Neo<br>
              out. When they are alone, Morpheus puts his hand on<br>
              Neo's shoulder.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              You don't have to tell me<br>
              anything, Neo, because I already<br>
              know what she said.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              You do?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              I brought you so that you could<br>
              hear it for yourself. I knew it<br>
              would help.</p>
            <p> Neo finishes his cookie.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              No one will ever ask you because<br>
              it is a gift from her. It is for<br>
              you and you alone.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Storm clouds shroud the streets as the sky turns<br>
              jaundice.</p>
            <p> Cypher nervously glances down the surrounding streets.<br>
              He notices several unmarked white vans.</p>
            <p> He mops the sweat from his forehead, when Trinity sees<br>
              the black Lincoln.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Here they come.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> In the hovercraft, we see the sweat rolling down Cypher's<br>
              face and neck.</p>
            <p> Tank is typing rapidly at the keyboard.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Weird. This area never has this<br>
              much activity.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Apoc opens the side door and they enter the hotel.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Mouse's CELLULAR RINGS.</p>
            <p> MOUSE<br>
              Welcome to Movie-Phone.</p>
            <p> TANK (V.O.)<br>
              They're on their way.</p>
            <p> MOUSE<br>
              Right.</p>
            <p> The phone flips shut as he jumps up.</p>
            <p> MOUSE<br>
              Let's get to work.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Light filters down the throat of the building through a<br>
              caged skylight at the top of the open elevator shaft.<br>
              Four figures glide up the dark stairs that wind around<br>
              the antique elevator.</p>
            <p> Neo notices a black cat, a yellow-green-eyed shadow that<br>
              slinks past them and pads quickly down the stairs.</p>
            <p> A moment later, Neo sees another black cat that looks and<br>
              moves identically to the first one.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Whoa. Deja vu.</p>
            <p> Those words stop the others dead in their tracks.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> The monitors suddenly glitch as though the Matrix had an<br>
              electronic seizure.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Oh, shit! Oh, shit!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Trinity turns around, her face tight.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              What did you just say?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Nothing. Just had a little deja vu.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              What happened? What did you see?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              A black cat went past us and then<br>
              I saw another that looked just<br>
              like it.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              How much like it? Was it the same<br>
              cat?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              It might have been. I'm not sure.</p>
            <p> Trinity looks at Morpheus, who listens quietly to the<br>
              rasping breath of the old building.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What is it?</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              A deja vu is usually a glitch in<br>
              the Matrix. It happens when they<br>
              change something.</p>
            <p> She also listens as the staccato BEAT of HELICOPTER<br>
              BLADES GROW ominously LOUDER.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Tank sees what was changed.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              It's a trap!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. STAIRCASE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Morpheus looks up the stairs as a helicopter shadow<br>
              passes over the clouded glass.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Come on!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Cable goes to the draped windows.</p>
            <p> CABLE<br>
              Did you just feel something weird?</p>
            <p> MOUSE<br>
              Yeah...</p>
            <p> The CELLULAR RINGS.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Heavy bolt-cutters snap through the main phone cable.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Mouse answers the phone.</p>
            <p> MOUSE<br>
              What's going on?</p>
            <p> TANK (V.O.)<br>
              They cut the hard-line! It's a trap! Get out!</p>
            <p> Cable yanks open the curtain.</p>
            <p> CABLE<br>
              Oh, no.</p>
            <p> The windows are bricked up.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> The door to the roof explodes open as heavily-armed rnen<br>
              rush towards room 1313.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Tank watches helplessly.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              No, no, no.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> The door slams open and the police force pours in, dozens<br>
              of assault rifles surrounding Mouse and Cable who are<br>
              armed with only handguns.</p>
            <p> CABLE<br>
              Morpheus! It's a trap --</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. STAIRS (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Morpheus stops as the scream is drowned by the REPORT of<br>
              MACHINE GUNS filling the building with a terrible fury.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Oh, God.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Mouse's body thrashes against its harness as --</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> BULLETS POUND him against the blood-splattered brick<br>
              window. Gun smoke thickens the room, Cable blasting and<br>
              moving until --</p>
            <p> The HAMMER CLICKS empty. He screams as a DOZEN GUNS OPEN FIRE, 
              ripping him apart.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Blood spits from Cable's mouth, his body spasming, then<br>
              lying perfectly still.</p>
            <p> The flat-line ALARM softly cries out from the life<br>
              MONITORS of the two dead men.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> More police cars arrive as cops break open the lobby<br>
              doors.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Flying downstairs, Morpheus stops, hearing the police<br>
              swarming below. He turns and rushes down the hall of the<br>
              eighth floor. At the end of it, he finds the bricked-up<br>
              windows.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              That's what they changed. We're trapped. There's no way out.</p>
            <p> The sound of heavy BOOT-STEPS close around them with the<br>
              mechanical sureness of a vice.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Give me your phone.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              They'll be able to track it.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              We have no choice.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Tank answers the call.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              Tank, find a structural drawing of<br>
              this building and find it fast.</p>
            <p> His fingers pound the keyboard.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Flashlights probe the rotting darkness as the police<br>
              search every floor.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> The diagram windows onto the screen.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Got it.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              I need the main wet-wall.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Agent Smith pauses, his hand going to his earpiece.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ROOM 808 (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Morpheus is guided by Tank.</p>
            <p> TANK (V.O.)<br>
              Now left and that's it in front of you.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Good.</p>
            <p> He cuts off the phone.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Agent Smith hears the LINE CLICK dead.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Eighth floor. They're on the eighth floor.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Agent Brown hears Smith on his earphone.</p>
            <p> AGENT BROWTJ<br>
              Eighth floor! Move!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Cops flood the eighth floor, rushing everywhere.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ROOM 808 (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Several cops sweep through the room. It is empty. As<br>
              they pass the bathroom, we see a man-sized hole smashed<br>
              through the plaster and lathe.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. WALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> They are inside the main plumbing wall, slowly worming<br>
              their way down the greasy, black stack pipes.</p>
            <p> Above them, light fills the hole they made to get inside.</p>
            <p> INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Brown turns to Smith.</p>
            <p> AGENT BROWN<br>
              Where are they?</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> The cops search in silence, straining for a clue, when<br>
              one hears SOMETHING STRANGE near the bathroom.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. WALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Cypher has slipped and is wedged between the wall and<br>
              several thick supply pipes.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> The Cop leans in, his ear almost against the thin<br>
              membrane of plaster separating them. He can hear<br>
              WHISPERS, HISSES and a GRUNT when --</p>
            <p> The WALL suddenly bulges, SHATTER-CRACKING <br>
              as the Cop realizes --</p>
            <p> COP<br>
              They're in the walls!</p>

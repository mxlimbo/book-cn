                BASIC INSTINCT</p>
              <p>INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
              <p>It is dark; we don't see clearly.</p>
              <p>a man and woman make love on a brass bed. There aremirrors on 
                the walls and ceiling. On a side table, atop asmall mirror, lines 
                of cocaine. A tape deck PLAYS theStones: &quot;Sympathy for the 
                Devil.&quot;</p>
              <p>Atop him... she straddles his chest... her breasts in hisface. 
                He cups her breasts. She leans down, kisses him...</p>
              <p>JOHNNY BOZ is in his late 40's, slim, good-looking. We don'tsee 
                the woman's face. She has long blonde hair. The CAMERASTAYS BEHIND 
                and to the side of them.</p>
              <p>She leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth...she 
                kisses him... she moves her hands up, holds both of hisarms above 
                his head.</p>
              <p>She moves higher atop him... she reaches to the side of thebed... 
                a white silk scarf is in her hand... her hips abovehis face now, 
                moving... slightly, oh-so slightly... hisface strains towards 
                her.</p>
              <p>The scarf in her hand... she ties his hands with it...gently... 
                to the brass bed... his eyes are closed...tighter... lowering 
                hips into his face... lower... over hischest... his navel. The 
                SONG plays.</p>
              <p>He is inside her... his head arches back... his throatwhite.</p>
              <p>She arches her back... her hips grind... her breasts arehigh...</p>
              <p>Her back arches back... back... her head tilts back... sheextends 
                her arms... the right arm comes down suddenly...the steel flashes... 
                his throat is white...</p>
              <p>He bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses...</p>
              <p>It flashes up... it flashes down... and up... and down...and

              <p>Winter in San Francisco: cold, foggy. Cop carseverywhere. The 
                lights play through the thick fog. TwoHomicide detectives get 
                out of the car, walk into thehouse.</p>

              <p>NICK CURRAN is 42. Trim, good-looking, a nice suit: a faceurban, 
                edged, shadowed. GUS MORAN is 64. Crew-cut, silverbeard, a suit 
                rumpled and shiny, a hat out of the 50's: aface worn and ruined: 
                the face of a backwoods philosopher.</p>
              <p>INT. THE BROWNSTONE</p>
              <p>There's money here -- deco, clean, hip -- That looks like aPicasso

                Fillmore now.</p>

              <p>INT. THE BEDROOM</p>
              <p>They walk in, stare -- it's messy.</p>
              <p>It's like a convention in here. LT. PHIL WALKER, in his50's, 
                silver-haired, the Homicide guys: JIM HARRIGAN, late40's, puffy, 
                affable; SAM ANDREWS, 30's, black. ACORONER'S MAN is working the

                You guys know Captain Talcott?</p>

                What do you think, Doc?</p>
              <p> THE CORONER'S GUY<br>
                The skin blanches when I press it --<br>
                this kind of color is about right<br>
                for six or eight hours.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                Nobody say anything. The maid came<br>
                in an hour ago and found him.<br>
                She's not a live-in.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                Maybe the maid did it.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                She's 54 years old and weighs 240<br>

                It ain't the maid.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                He left the club with his<br>
                girlfriend about midnight. That's<br>
                the last time anybody saw him.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>

              <p> THE CORONER'S GUY<br>
                Ice pick. Left on the coffee table<br>
                in the living room. Thin steel<br>
                handle. Forensics took it<br>
                downtown.</p>
              <p> HARRIGAN<br>
                There's come all over the sheets --<br>
                he got off before he got offed.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                (deadpan)<br>
                That rules the maid out for sure.</p>
              <p> CAPT. TALCOTT<br>
                This is sensitive. Mr. Boz was a<br>
                major contributor to the mayor's<br>
                campaign. He was Chairman of the<br>

                and roll star.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                He was a retired rock and roll<br>
                star.</p>
              <p> CAPT. TALCOTT<br>
                A civic-minded, very respectable<br>

              <p> GUS<br>
                What's that over there?</p>
              <p>We see the white powder laid out in lines on the smallmirror

              <p> NICK<br>
                (deadpan)<br>
                It looks like some civic-minded,<br>
                very respectable cocaine to me,<br>
                Gus.</p>
              <p> CAPT. TALCOTT<br>
                (evenly, to Nick)<br>
                Listen to me, Curran. I'm going to<br>
                get a lot of heat on this. I don't<br>
                want any... mistakes.</p>

                Catherine Tramell, 162 Divisadero.</p>
              <p>Nick writes it down. He and Gus turn, leave. CaptainTalcott watches 
                them. He looks disturbed.</p>
              <p>INT. THE LIVING ROOM</p>

              <p> NICK<br>
                Talcott doesn't usually show up at<br>
                the office 'till after his 18<br>

                about?</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                They're executives. They're<br>

                like Roxy; there is a smoky kind ofsensuousness about her.</p>

              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (evenly)<br>
                I know who you are.</p>
              <p>She doesn't look at them. She looks at the water.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                How did he die?</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                He was murdered.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Really. Maybe that's why you're<br>
                from Homicide. How?</p>
              <p>Nick glances at Gus.</p>

                NICK<br>
                With an ice pick.</p>
              <p>She closes her eyes a beat and then, still staring out, wesee 
                a thin smile. They see it, too, and glance at eachother.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                How long were you dating him?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                I wasn't dating him. I was fucking<br>
                him.</p>
              <p>They glance at each other again.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                What are you -- a pro?</p>
              <p>Catherine looks at him -- that thin smile again.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                No. I'm an amateur.</p>
              <p>She looks away.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                How long were you having sex with<br>
                him?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                About a year and a half.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Were you with him last night?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Yes.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Did you leave the club with him?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Yes.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Did you go home with him?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                No. We had a drink at the club.<br>
                We left together. I came here. He<br>
                went home.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Was there anyone with you last<br>
                night?</p>
              <p><br>
                9.</p>
              <p><br>
                CATHERINE<br>
                (looks at Nick)<br>
                No. I wasn't in the mood to have<br>
                sex with anyone last night.</p>
              <p>They look at her a beat.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Let me ask you something, Ms.<br>
                Tramell? Are you sorry he's dead?</p>
              <p>Catherine looks at him.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Yes. I liked fucking him.</p>
              <p>They stare at her. She looks out at the water.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                I don't really feel like talking<br>
                anymore.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                listen, lady, we can do this<br>
                downtown if you --</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Read me my rights and arrest me and<br>
                I'll go downtown.</p>
              <p>She doesn't even look at them.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing;<br>
                quietly)<br>
                Otherwise, get the fuck out of<br>
                here. Please.</p>
              <p>A long beat as they look at her.</p>
              <p>INT. A CORRIDOR - POLICE HEADQUARTERS</p>
              <p>The door says: Dr. Elizabeth Gardner, Counseling. Nickopens the

              <p> NICK<br>
                I'm sorry, Beth. I -- I got hung<br>
                up in Stinson.</p>

                I'm fine! How the hell long do I<br>
                have to keep doing this?</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                As long as Internal Affairs wants<br>
                you to, I suppose. Sit down, Nick.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                It's bullshit. You know it is.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                I know it is -- but sit down anyway<br>
                so we can get it over with, okay?</p>
              <p>He sits down.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                So -- how are things?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                Things are fine. I told you.<br>
                They're fine.</p>
              <p>She watches him closely.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                How is your -- personal life?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                My sex life is fine.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                My sex life is pretty shitty<br>
                actually since I stopped seeing you<br>
                -- maybe I should think about my<br>
                Electrolux again.</p>
              <p>That embarrassed her; she looks away from him.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (continuing; after a<br>
                beat)<br>
                Sorry.</p>
              <p>She shrugs. A beat.</p>

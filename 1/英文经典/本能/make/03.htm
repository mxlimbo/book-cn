              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                I had sex with him for about a year<br>
                and a half. I liked having sex<br>
                with him.</p>

                He wasn't afraid of experimenting.<br>
                I like men like that. I like men<br>
                who give me pleasure. He gave me a<br>

                No. Johnny liked to use his hands<br>

                white silk scarves.<br>
                (she smiles)<br>
                I have a very vivid imagination.</p>

                I'd have to be pretty stupid to<br>
                write a book about a killing and<br>
                then kill him the way I described<br>
                in my book. I'd be announcing<br>
                myself as the killer. I'm not<br>
                stupid.</p>
              <p>She smiles.</p>
              <p> TALCOTT<br>
                We know you're not stupid, Ms.<br>

              <p> NICK<br>
                Writing a book about it gives you<br>
                an alibi for not killing him.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>

              <p>It is an old, mint-condition silver Porsche.</p>
              <p>It is pouring rain; the wind is blowing: a San Franciscowinter 
                storm.</p>
              <p>Nothing is said a long beat as he drives. She yawns.Stretches. 
                He looks at her.</p>
              <p> 28.</p>
              <p><br>
                CATHERINE<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                I'm tired.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                It's got to be tiring to beat that<br>
                machine.</p>
              <p>She looks at him and looks away. A beat.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                If I were guilty, and if I wanted<br>
                to beat that machine, it wouldn't<br>
                be tiring. It wouldn't be tiring<br>
                at all.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Why not?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Because I'm a professional liar. I<br>
                spend most of my waking hours<br>
                dwelling on my lies.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                For my writing.</p>
              <p>He looks at her.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing; smiles)<br>
                I love the rain, don't you?</p>
              <p>He says nothing, doesn't look at her.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                You took a polygraph after you shot<br>
                those two people, didn't you?</p>
              <p>He looks at her now.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                I passed.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                You see? We're both innocent, Nick.</p>
              <p>He pulls up in front of her house on Divisadero, stops. Hesees 
                the white Ferrari in the driveway.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                How do you know all this stuff<br>
                about me?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                You know all about me.</p>
              <p> ¡î¡î29.</p>
              <p><br>
                NICK<br>
                I don't know anything that isn't<br>
                police business.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                You know I don't like to wear any<br>
                underwear, don't you, Nick?</p>
              <p>They look at each other a beat.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing; smiles)<br>
                Thanks for the ride.</p>
              <p>And she's out of the car. He watches her as she hurries inthe 
                rain -- his eyes on her until the moment she opens thedoor and 
                is inside.</p>
              <p>INT. THE TEN-FOUR - NIGHT</p>
              <p>It is a police bar, San Francisco style. Ferns JoeMontana and 
                Will Clark posters. The jukebox has a lot ofTony Bennett.</p>
              <p>He walks in. He sees Lt. Walker at a back booth with Gus,goes 
                to them, sits down.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                What is all this &quot;Nick&quot; stuff --<br>
                Nick would you like a cigarette.<br>
                Nick can you give me a ride.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                She didn't ask me for the ride.<br>
                She asked anybody.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                And you volunteered.</p>
              <p>A BARTENDER stays behind the bar, but yells to him.</p>
              <p> THE BARTENDER<br>
                Perrier, Nick?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Double Black Jack rocks, Harry.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                (with concern)<br>
                What you doin', son?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                It's my first drink in three<br>
                months. That okay with you, pop?<br>
                (to Lt. Walker)<br>
                She doesn't know me. I never saw<br>
                her before Gus and I talked to her.</p>
              <p> 30.</p>
              <p><br>
                THE BARTENDER<br>
                Here you go, Nick.</p>
              <p>He gets up, gets his drink --</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Thanks, Harry.</p>
              <p>He sits back down. He takes a big slug. They watch him.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                You sure?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                I'm sure.</p>
              <p>He takes another big slug.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                Now what?</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                What now what? Now nothing. She<br>
                passed the polygraph. That's it.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                She knew she could beat it. That's<br>
                why she asked to take it.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                How the fuck do you know? What is<br>
                it with you and this broad anyway?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Come on, Phil. You're not gonna<br>
                let this slide. What about her<br>
                parents? What about what else<br>
                she's published? At least we<br>
                should get the stuff to see if we<br>
                find anything else that's an<br>
                amazing real-life coincidence.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                Her parents died in an accident. I<br>
                don't care what else she's written.<br>
                What are you -- a book critic?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                How did they die? Was there an<br>
                investigation?</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                How you're saying she killed her<br>
                parents? Did she kill Bobby<br>
                Vasquez, too?</p>

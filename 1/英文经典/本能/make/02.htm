                You forgot her degree in<br>
                literature. She's a writer. She<br>
                published a novel last year under a<br>
                pen name. Do you want to know what<br>

                and Beth Gardner. With them is an older, white-hairedman, DR. 
                ANDREW LAMOTT. There are copies of &quot;Love Hurts&quot;around

              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                Dr. Gardner?</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                I've asked Dr. Lamott to consult<br>
                with us. This isn't really my<br>
                turf. Dr. Lamott teaches the<br>
                psycho-pathology of psychopathic<br>
                behavior at Stanford and is also a<br>
                member of the Justice Department's<br>
                Psychological Profile team. Dr.<br>
                Lamott?</p>
              <p> DR. LAMOTT<br>
                There are two possibilities. One:<br>
                The person who wrote this book is<br>
                your murderer and acted out the<br>
                killing described in ritualistic,<br>
                literal detail. Two: Someone who<br>
                wants to do the person who wrote<br>
                this book harm read the book and<br>
                enacted the killing described to<br>
                incriminate the writer.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a long beat)<br>
                What if the writer did it? What<br>
                are we dealing with?</p>
              <p> DR. LAMOTT<br>
                You're dealing with a devious,<br>
                diabolical mind. This book must<br>
                have been written at least six<br>
                months, maybe years before it was<br>
                published. That means the writer<br>
                planned the crime, at least in the<br>
                subconscious, back then.</p>
              <p> ¡î¡î15.</p>

                DR. LAMOTT<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                The fact that the writer carried it<br>
                out indicates psychopathic<br>
                obsessive behavior in terms not<br>
                only of the killing itself but in<br>
                terms of applied advance defense<br>
                mechanism.</p>

                Most times I can't tell shit from<br>
                shinola, Doc. What was all that<br>
                you just said?</p>
              <p>Some grins, titters.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                She anticipates the book to be her<br>
                best alibi.</p>
              <p> DR. LAMOTT<br>
                Correct.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                She's going to say: Do you think<br>
                I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone<br>
                in the exact way I've described in<br>
                my book? I wouldn't do that<br>
                because I'd know I'd be a suspect.</p>
              <p>A long beat -- as they think about it.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                What if it's not the writer? What<br>
                if it's someone who read the book?</p>
              <p> DR. LAMOTT<br>
                You're dealing then with someone so<br>
                obsessed that he or she is willing<br>
                to kill an irrelevant and innocent<br>
                victim to place the blame on the<br>
                person who wrote this book. We are<br>
                talking about deep-seated,<br>
                obsessional hatred; an utter lack<br>
                of sense of proportion or<br>
                perspective.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                We've got a top-of-the-line, once-<br>
                in-a-lifetime loony-tune either way<br>
                you cut it -- that's what you're<br>
                saying, right, Doc?</p>
              <p> DR. LAMOTT<br>
                You're dealing with someone very<br>
                dangerous and very ill.</p>

              <p>INT. THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE - DAY</p>

              <p> CORRIGAN<br>
                Come on, you know there's no case<br>
                here. There's no physical<br>
                evidence -- okay, she doesn't have<br>
                an alibi: but there's no motive.<br>
                Her defense would just beat us to<br>
                death with the copycat thing.<br>
                Anybody who read the book could<br>
                have done it.</p>
              <p>A long beat; no one says anything.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>

              <p> TALCOTT<br>
                She's got enough money to burn this<br>

              <p> CORRIGAN<br>
                It won't do any good. She'll come<br>

                (after a beat)<br>
                I think you're as crazy as she<br>
                probably is, Curran.</p>
              <p>Nicks says nothing.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                You know what they say: It takes<br>
                one to know one.</p>
              <p>Nick looks a Gus, grins.</p>
              <p>EXT. HER HOUSE IN STINSON - DAY</p>
              <p>They walk from the car to the door of the big beach house.They 
                ring the bell. They hear typing inside. The typingstops. She comes 
                to the door in jeans and a tight-fittingsweatshirt.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come<br>
                downtown and answer some questions<br>
                for us.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Are you arresting me?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                If that's the way you want to play<br>
                it.</p>
              <p>They look at each other a beat.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                Can I change into something more<br>
                appropriate? It'll just take a<br>
                minute.</p>
              <p>He nods.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                Come in.</p>
              <p>INT. THE HOUSE</p>
              <p>It is beautifully done in a Santa Fe motif. She goes to abedroom 
                of the living room.</p>
              <p><br>
                18.</p>
              <p>Nick sits down on a couch facing the bedroom she's walkedinto. 
                Gus sits across from him, his back to the bedroom.There is a coffee 
                table between them. She leaves thebedroom door halfway open.</p>
              <p>An old newspaper is on the coffee table them. Nick reachesfor 
                it. The headline says: VICE COP CLEARED IN TOURISTSHOOTINGS. A 
                headline underneath says: GRAND JURY SAYSSHOOTINGS ACCIDENTAL. 
                There is a photograph of Nick.</p>
              <p>He stares at the paper.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE (O.S.)<br>
                How long will this take?</p>
              <p>Nick puts the paper down on the coffee table. He is lostin his 
                thoughts. Gus picks the paper up.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (looks up)<br>
                I don't know.</p>
              <p>Nick, facing the half open bedroom door, sees a mirror nearthe 
                wall of the bedroom. The mirror reflects her in theother corner 
                of the bedroom. She is taking her clothesoff. He stares. She strips 
                down. He sees her back. Shehas a beautiful body. Naked, she puts 
                a dress on. Shedoesn't put any underwear on.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                Do you always keep old newspapers<br>
                around?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE (O.S.)<br>
                Only when they make interesting<br>
                reading.</p>
              <p>And she is suddenly out of the bedroom. She stands there,smiles. 
                They look at each other a long beat.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (finally)<br>
                I'm ready.</p>
              <p>They get up, head out.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                You have the right to an attorney.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Why would I need an attorney?</p>
              <p>INT. THE CAR - DAY</p>
              <p>They sit in the front; she is in the back. The car goesover the 
                winding, two-lane Mt. Tamalpais road.</p>
              <p> ¡î¡î19.</p>
              <p>The fog is heavy. It's starting to rain. We see the beachfar 
                below.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Do you have a cigarette?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                I don't smoke.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Yes you do.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                I quit.</p>
              <p>She smiles, looks at him. A beat, and he turns away.Another beat, 
                and she lights a cigarette up.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                I thought you were out of<br>
                cigarettes.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                I found some in my purse; would you<br>
                like one?</p>
              <p>He turns back to her.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                I told you -- I quit.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                It won't last.</p>
              <p>A beat, as she looks at him, and then he turns away.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                You workin' on another book?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Yes I am.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                It must really be somehtin' --<br>
                makin' stuff up all the time.</p>
              <p>He watches her in the rearview mirror.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                It teaches you to lie.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                How's that?</p>
              <p> ¡î¡î20.</p>
              <p><br>
                CATHERINE<br>
                You make it up, but it has to be<br>
                believable. They call it<br>
                suspension of disbelief.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                I like that. &quot;Suspension of<br>
                Disbelief.&quot;</p>
              <p>He smiles at her in the mirror.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                What's your new book about?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                A detective. He falls for the<br>
                wrong woman.</p>
              <p>He turns back to her.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                What happens to him?</p>
              <p>She looks right into his eye.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                She kills him.</p>
              <p>A beat, as they look at each other, and then he turns awayfrom 
                her. Gus watcher her in the rearview mirror.</p>
              <p>INT. A POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY</p>
              <p>It is large, fluorescent-lighted, antiseptic.</p>

                Would you like some coffee?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>

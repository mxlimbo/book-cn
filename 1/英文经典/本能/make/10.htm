                Joke?<br>
                (a beat; he almost<br>
                smiles)<br>

                The games are over. You were<br>
                right. It was the fuck of the<br>
                century, Shooter.</p>
              <p>He stares at her.</p>
              <p> A VOICE INSIDE<br>
                Catherine?</p>
              <p>Nick looks -- Hazel Dobkins is there.</p>
              <p>Catherine still has her eyes on him.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Right there.</p>
              <p>A beat, and then she turns to go inside. Hazel Dobkinssmiles 
                slowly at him.</p>

                Catherine Tramell's roommate her<br>
                freshman year. I got a call from<br>
                her. I've been calling people who<br>
                were in her dorm all day. She<br>
                must've heard I was trying to talk<br>
                to her. She says she knows all<br>
                about Catherine and Lisa Henderson.<br>
                She's over in Oakland. You wanna<br>
                come with me?</p>
              <p>Nick just stares ahead.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                You look like you seen a ghost, son?</p>

                office on Van Ness. Guess who he<br>
                shares office space with? Dr.<br>
                Elizabeth Gardner.</p>
              <p> 99.</p>
              <p>Nick doesn't even respond. Gus looks at him.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                What in hell's the matter with you?</p>

              <p> GUS<br>
                Where the hell you goin'?</p>

              <p> GUS<br>
                She said alone -- suite 405. It<br>
                ain't gonna take long.</p>
              <p>A beat, and Nick gets back in the car.</p>
              <p>INT. THE OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Gus is on the first floor. There is no one around. Hehits the 
                elevator button. A beat, and it comes. He stepsin.</p>
              <p>INT. THE ELEVATOR - NIGHT</p>
              <p>He hits the button for the fourth floor.</p>
              <p>The elevator rises a floor, stops. The door opens. Thereis no 
                one there. Then it starts going up again. It risesto the third 
                floor. It stops. The door opens. There isno one there. Then it 
                starts to rise again.</p>
              <p>EXT. GUS' CADILLAC - NIGHT</p>

                Gus!</p>
              <p>INT. THE ELEVATOR</p>
              <p>As it goes up. It stops. The door starts to open. As itdoes -- 
                a figure in a hooded raincoat sweeps into the</p>
              <p>elevator. It happens very fast. We see blonde hair aroundthe 
                face.</p>

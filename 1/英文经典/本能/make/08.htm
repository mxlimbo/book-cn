              <p>They look at each other a long beat. Gus drinks morecoffee. He 
                sits back, pulls his cowboy hat over his eyes.A long beat.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                (continuing;<br>
                quietly)<br>
                I.A. done did a track on Lt. Martin<br>
                D for Dickhead Nilsen. They found<br>
                a safety deposit box with fifty-<br>
                thousand dollars in it, taken out<br>
                three months ago, used that one<br>
                time.</p>
              <p>He looks at the fat woman again -- leers at her obscenely.She 
                looks away.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a long beat)<br>
                It doesn't make sense. She didn't<br>
                know me three months ago.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                Maybe it wasn't her that paid him.<br>
                Maybe the money was for somethin'<br>
                else. How the fuck do I know? I'm<br>
                just an old city cowboy tryin' not<br>
                to fall outta his saddle.</p>
              <p>Nick looks at him and smiles a thin smile; he's not there,he's 
                completely preoccupied.</p>
              <p>INT. A CAR - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Someone is watching as he and Gus come out of the diner.</p>
              <p>EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT</p>
              <p>He stands by Gus as Gus gets into his battered, rusted,vintage 
                Cadillac.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                You all right, pop? You want me to<br>
                drive you?</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                In that little pissant car of<br>

                watch.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Come on, I'll drive you in this<br>
                thing.</p>

              <p><br>
                GUS<br>
                You think I'd let you drive my<br>

              <p>And he steps on the gas and ROARS out of there, forcingNick to 
                get out of the way. Nick looks after him a longbeat, shakes his 
                head.</p>
              <p>INT. A CAR - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Someone is following him slowly as he walks down thestreet. He 
                turns a corner, walks down the alley towardshis Porsche, parked 
                behind the country and western bar.</p>
              <p>The car suddenly speeds up -- ROARS down on him from theback, 
                full bore.</p>
              <p>EXT. THE ALLEY</p>
              <p>He hurls himself across the Porsche's hood... barelyavoiding 
                the car. He sees the car at the end of the alley,turning out: 
                It is a black Ferrari.</p>
              <p>INT. HIS PORSCHE</p>
              <p>He GUNS it down the alley, makes a wild turn in thedirection 
                the Ferrari turned.</p>
              <p>EXT. THE STREET</p>
              <p>The Porsche dodges around cars very fast, almost side-swiping 
                them, looking almost out of control, its MOTORscreaming.</p>
              <p>INT. THE PORSCHE</p>
              <p>He sees the Ferrari turn ahead. When he gets to where itturned, 
                he turns wildly.</p>
              <p>EXT. THE STREET</p>
              <p>The Ferrari is making fast, wild turns into little streetsin 
                North Beach, its MOTOR screaming -- the Porsche isgaining ground 
                behind it, making turns.</p>
              <p>INT. THE PORSCHE</p>
              <p>The Ferrari is up ahead and makes a wild right turn onto aroad 
                going up a hillside. He yanks the wheel hard.</p>
              <p>EXT. THE STEPS</p>
              <p>The Porsche rockets up the steps -- bouncing high into theair, 
                almost out of control.</p>
              <p><br>
                73.</p>
              <p>INT. THE PORSCHE</p>
              <p>As it crests the steps and gets to the street. Nick GUNSit and 
                it looks like it flies high down the hill-side intoblackness.</p>
              <p>EXT. THE STREET</p>
              <p>But it lands on more steps -- heading downward -- bucking,almost 
                spinning, it bounces onto the next street.</p>
              <p>INT. THE PORSCHE</p>
              <p>Another set of steps leading up: he GUNS it, it rocketsup, ROARS, 
                bucking --</p>
              <p>EXT. THE STREET</p>
              <p>And lands on the next street. Nick makes a wild right turnonto 
                the street. And the black Ferrari appears from arounda curve to 
                the right, heading right for him.</p>
              <p>INT. THE PORSCHE</p>
              <p>Nick steps on the GAS and heads head-on for the Ferrari.The Ferrari 
                SCREAMS head-on for him.</p>
              <p>EXT. THE STREET</p>
              <p>And at the last moment, in the game of chicken, the Ferraritries 
                to swerve around him on this narrow road, goes out ofcontrol and 
                over the side, turning over and over as itrolls down the hillside.</p>
              <p>EXT. THE HILLSIDE</p>
              <p>The Ferrari has landed right-side up.</p>
              <p>He runs down the hillside and gets to it. A beat, and heopens 
                the car door.</p>
              <p>Roxy lies hunched over the wheel, her eyes open. Her neckis broken. 
                She is dead.</p>
              <p>EXT. THE HILLSIDE - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Police lights have been set up. He stands there with Lt.Walker 
                and several of the Internal Affairs men.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                Tell me again. I want to hear you<br>
                say it again.</p>

                (after a beat;<br>
                sheepish)<br>
                It was an accident.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                You're driving around North Beach<br>
                for no particular reason and this<br>
                car won't get out of the way --</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                I don't think she meant to go off<br>
                the hill, do you?</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                (quietly)<br>
                Don't fuck with me, Nick. I don't<br>
                need a reason to put your ass in a<br>
                sling.</p>
              <p>He and Nick look at each other a long beat. Andrews comesup to 
                them with a piece of paper in his hand.</p>
              <p> ANDREWS<br>

                address -- Cloverdale, California.<br>
                No priors, no convictions. The car<br>
                is registered to Catherine Tramell.</p>
              <p>Lt. Walker looks at Nick like he's going to kill him. Nicklooks 
                calmly away.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                You knew her, didn't you?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Gus and I talked to her at<br>
                Tramell's house. All we did was<br>
                write her name down.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                I told you to stay away from<br>
                Tramell.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat;<br>
                smiles)<br>
                Yeah. But you didn't tell me to<br>
                stay away from her car.</p>
              <p>Walker looks at him in absolute disbelief.</p>
              <p> AN I.A. MAN<br>
                I want you in Dr. Gardner's office<br>
                at nine o'clock. You're out of<br>

                to this time?</p>
              <p>They stare at him. He watches as Roxy's body is taken away.</p>
              <p>INT. A POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM -DAY</p>
              <p>He walks in. He looks good, in control. Beth Gardner issitting 
                there with two middle-aged MEN, both of themwearing suits, who 
                smile and scrutinize him the instant hewalks in the door.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                Hello, Nick. This is Dr. Myron and<br>
                R. McElwaine. They've been asked<br>
                to consult with me on this<br>
                evaluation.</p>
              <p>They shake hands with him.</p>
              <p> DR. MYRON<br>
                Sit down, Nick.</p>
              <p>Nick gives him a look: What did he think he was going todo -- 
                stand there?</p>
              <p>He sits down, looks at them. A beat, as they look at him,then 
                --</p>

                (courtly)<br>
                Nick -- when you recollect your<br>
                childhood, are your recollections<br>
                pleasing to you?</p>
              <p>Nick looks at them a long beat in disbelief.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (calmly, directly)<br>
                Number one: I don't remember how<br>
                often I used to jack off, but it<br>
                was a lot.<br>
                Number two: I didn't get pissed<br>
                off at my dad -- even after I was<br>
                old enough to know what he and mom<br>
                were doing in the bedroom.<br>
                Number three: I don't look in the<br>
                toilet before I flush it.<br>
                Number four: I don't wet the bed<br>
                and haven't for some time.<br>
                Number five: You can go fuck<br>
                yourselves because I'm out of here.</p>

              <p>INT. THE CORRIDOR</p>
              <p>He is walking away quickly. Beth is with him, trying tokeep up. 
                She is very angry.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                What is your problem? I'm trying<br>
                to help you. Why won't you let me<br>
                help you?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                I don't need any help.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                Yes you do. Something's on with<br>
                you.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                You're sleeping with her, aren't<br>
                you?</p>
              <p>A beat, he stops looks at her, then keeps walking.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                What is this interest you've got in<br>
                her?</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                My interest is in you, not in her.<br>
                She seduces people, she<br>
                manipulates --</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                I thought you hardly know her.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                I know the type. I'm a<br>
                psychologist.</p>
              <p>He stops, looks at her.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                That means you manipulate people<br>
                too, doesn't it, Beth? You're a<br>
                practicing psychologist -- that<br>
                means you're better at it than she<br>
                is.</p>
              <p>She looks at him a long beat.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                (quietly)<br>
                I feel sorry for you, Nick</p>
              <p>A beat, and she turns and walks away.</p>

              <p>EXT. ROAD TO STINSON HOUSE - DAY</p>
              <p>Nick is driving down winding road to Stinson house. He isdriving 
                very fast, passing other cars on the winding andtwisting road.</p>
              <p>INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - DAY</p>
              <p>Nick enters and shuts door. Looking around, he does notsee her.</p>

                (after a beat)<br>
                Catherine!</p>
              <p>Finally he sees her sitting by the window. He walks overto her.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (near tears)<br>
                I should have known. I came into<br>
                the house when you were down on the<br>
                beach. She looked at me so<br>
                strangely. She left right after<br>
                you.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                I shouldn't have let her watch us.<br>
                She wanted to watch me all the<br>
                time. She tried to kill you,<br>
                didn't she?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                Did you like her to watch?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (a long beat)<br>
                Do you think I told her to kill You?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (softly, with<br>
                intensity)<br>
                No.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (after a beat, near<br>
                tears)<br>
                Everybody that I care about dies.</p>
              <p>She is about to break into uncontrolable sobbing. Nickputs his 
                arms around her.</p>
              <p><br>
                78.</p>
              <p><br>
                NICK<br>
                (soothing)<br>
                It's OK. It's OK.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (quietly, almost<br>
                begging)<br>
                Make love to me.</p>
              <p>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
              <p>They are seen rolling and turning around on each other.Their 
                love making is sensual, sincere.</p>
              <p>Later in bed.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (calmly, but<br>
                seriously)<br>
                Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (surprised,<br>
                startled)<br>
                For what... to set me up? She<br>
                loved me she wouldn't frame me.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                Maybe she got jealous of Johnny<br>
                Boz, too.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                No, she didn't... she never got<br>
                jealous before... she got excited.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                I don't have luck with women.<br>
                There was this girl I met while I<br>
                was in college. I slept with her<br>
                once. She started following me<br>
                around, taking my picture. She<br>
                dyed her hair, copied my clothes.<br>
                Lisa something... Oberman. It was<br>
                awful.</p>
              <p><br>
                79.</p>
              <p>A long beat, he looks at her.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                I thought you didn't do adolescent<br>
                secrets.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                I never have before.</p>
              <p>EXT. THE DECK - MORNING</p>
              <p>It is a bright, sunshiny day. He is out there looking atthe water. 
                She comes up behind him, hugs him.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (full of life)<br>
                Isn't it just beautiful? I love it<br>
                here like this.</p>
              <p>He looks at her.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (cold)<br>
                We're still playing games, aren't<br>
                we?</p>
              <p>She looks hurt.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                No.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (cold)<br>
                No?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                No more games, Nick. I'm tired of<br>
                playing games!</p>
              <p>They have their eyes on each other.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Then tell me about Nilsen.</p>
              <p>She turns away from him. He watches her.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                You won't believe me.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Try me.</p>
              <p>A beat, she looks at him.</p>
              <p><br>
                80.</p>
              <p><br>
                CATHERINE<br>
                I paid him $50,000 in cash for your<br>
                psychiatric file.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                When?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                About three months before I met you.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Why?</p>
              <p>She turns away from him.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                I'd read about your shootings in<br>
                the papers. I decided to write a<br>
                book about a detective. I wanted<br>
                to know my character.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                You paid $50,000 for your character?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                I would've paid more. I wanted to<br>
                know everything about you. Then<br>
                you came down here after Johnny got<br>
                killed... it gave me a chance to<br>
                get to know my character better.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a long beat)<br>
                What about the other night. What<br>
                about last night? Was that to get<br>
                to know your character?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                Maybe I'm losing interest in my<br>
                book.</p>
              <p>Their eyes are on each other.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                Do you believe me?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                I don't know.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                I'll convince you.</p>

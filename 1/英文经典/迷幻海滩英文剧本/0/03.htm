            <p>　　Richard walks along a narrow wooden pontoon, his rucksack on 
              his back.</p>
            <p>　　He stops about half way along at a small narrow wooden boat with 
              an outboard motor.</p>
            <p>　　He looks down into it.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne and Francoise walk past him along the pontoon without 
              stopping and disappear from view.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　OK, let's face it. There is no such thing as a local fisherman 
              anymore. There really isn't the demand for them. If you want to 
              catch fish you put down a hundred kilometer drag net.</p>
            <p>　　Richard walks away along the pontoon.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　And if you want to go somewhere - you get a taxi.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. SEA.. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard, Francoise and Etiene sit at the back of a small powerful 
              motor launch which skims across the surface of the sea with great 
              noise and speed.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　The motor launch idles gently as it drifts into the shallows 
              of a small deserted bay.</p>
            <p>　　Richard Francoise, and Etienne jump from the boat into the shallows.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　As the sun sets they sit in silence, each shovelling down forkloads 
              of noodles.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　The only sounds are those of crickets and the waves gently breaking 
              on the shore.</p>
            <p>　　Richard is lying asleep on the sand.</p>
            <p>　　He is woken by someone rummaging through the rucksack beside 
              him. It is Francoise, removing clothes, books, souvenirs. Eventually 
              she finds her camera, a mini-tripod and a cable-release.</p>
            <p>　　She places them on an unfolded T-shirt on the sand.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Francoise -</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste 
              film taking photographs of the sky.</p>
            <p>　　Richard wakes up and works out what she is doing.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I think so too.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　One night I will get the perfect photograph.</p>
            <p>　　She presses the cable release.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six.</p>
            <p>　　She lets the shutter close.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　Take a look.</p>
            <p>　　Richard leans over and squints down the viewfinder.</p>
            <p>　　The sky is framed. Francoise leans into the frame.</p>
            <p>　　Richard draws back.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, 
              just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. 
              You're photographing yourself.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Incredible</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can 
              happen does happen.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, 
              on another the victim.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Exactly</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Richard, you know something - </p>
            <p>　　She hands him the cable release while she adjusts the camera.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen 
              and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep 
              with them.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE </p>
            <p>　　It's just the sky, Richard. </p>
            <p>　　She presses his thumb down on the cable release, her hand around 
              his. </p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept´</p>
            <p>　　EXT. NIGHT. SKY. </p>
            <p>　　Francoise voice fades away over an image of the night sky.</p>
            <p>　　Time lapse: the sky rapidly changes to day.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　When you develop an infatuation for someone, you always find 
              a reason to believe that this is exactly the person for you. It 
              doesn't need to be a good reason, a bad one will do just as well. 
              Taking photographs of the night sky, for example: in the long run 
              that's just the kind of dumb irritating habit that would cause you 
              to split up. But at the time - it's the charming eccentricity you've 
              been searching for all these years. </p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　From a different beach they look towards their target: the island. 
              It is 1-2 kilometers away.</p>
            <p>　　Richard, Etienne, and Francoise stand on the beach looking towards 
              it. Each is in their swimwear and a T-shirt, and carries a plastic 
              bag, inflated and tied, in which they carry their valuables and 
              some rations.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　One kilometer</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Two.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Richard?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I don't know - I'm American.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　So?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　We think in miles, not kilometers.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　So how many miles do you think it is?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I have no idea but it looks like a long way.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE.</p>
            <p>　　Too far?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　If it's too far, then we'll drwon. But if we don't' try then 
              we'll never know.</p>
            <p>　　Richard wades into the water.,</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　So, let's go.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　You have to enjoy a moment like that. You just don't know, you 
              see; it may never happen again.</p>
            <p>　　Once more.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　SO, let's go.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.) </p>
            <p>　　I am such a fucking hero. &quot;Let's go&quot;. I felt like I'd 
              waited all my life just to say something like that. So I replayed 
              it a couple of times, taking it from different perspectives. </p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Multiple repeats of Richard's moment from various perspectives 
              and speeds. </p>
            <p>　　RICHARD </p>
            <p>　　So: let's go. </p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.) </p>
            <p>　　You have to enjoy a moment like that. You just don't know, you 
              see: it may never happen again. </p>
            <p>　　Once more. </p>
            <p>　　RICHARD </p>
            <p>　　So: let's go. </p>
            <p>　　He dives in and begins swimming.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. SEA. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　They are far out to sea now, several hundred meters from the 
              shore.</p>
            <p>　　Richard swims at the front, the other two about five meters behind.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Everyone ok?</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　We're ok.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I think we're about half way.</p>
            <p>　　A few strokes later.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Richard - I saw a fin!</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　What!</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　A fin!</p>
            <p>　　They all stop and tread water.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　A shark fin?</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Big?</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE.</p>
            <p>　　Yes.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about 
              it.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　I'm sorry.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　A bit fucking late.</p>
            <p>　　He starts swimming again.</p>
            <p>　　A few strokes later he hears a short sharp scream from Francoise.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Francoise! Francoise!</p>
            <p>　　Richard turns around. Francoise is gone. Her plastic bag bobs 
              on the surface. Etienne is frantic, hysterical.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　She is gone!</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　What happened?</p>
            <p>　　Etienne submerges briefly and resurfaces.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, 
              I don't see her.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?</p>
            <p>　　They both start looking down at their feet and circling frantically 
              in the water.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　I don't know! I don't know! Oh God.</p>
            <p>　　Suddenly Richard screams.</p>
            <p>　　Francoise surfaces, pulling up his ankle.</p>
            <p>　　She and Etienne laugh at Richard.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Very funny. You Europeans, you have ssuch a playful sense of 
              humor. No wonder your comedy has conquered the world.</p>
            <p>　　He swims on.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　What about Moliere?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Fuck off.</p>
            <p>　　He swims on without looking round.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　One by one the three swimmers emerge from the sea and collapse 
              on the beach. They are absolutely exhausted and lie there on the 
              sand, unable to speak.</p>
            <p>　　Eventually, they tear open their plastic bags, drink some water 
              and eat some chocolate.</p>
            <p>　　Richard has a little water left in his bottle. He notices Francoise 
              and Etienne eyeing it enviously.</p>
            <p>　　He holds the bottle out towards them, then snatches it back and 
              swigs down the last of the water.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FOREST. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard, Francoise, and Etienne walk through the forest behind 
              the beach.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FOREST. DAY </p>
            <p>　　They scramble up a steep slope through dense foliage. </p>
            <p>　　Richard, at the front, pauses to let the other two pass him, 
              then he follows.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. TOP OF SLOPE/CLEARING. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard reaches the top of the slope and follows the other two 
              through a gap in the foliage.</p>
            <p>　　He joins Etienne and Francoise who are standing in awe at the 
              edge of a large clearing filled with cannabis plants.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Nice Island.</p>
            <p>　　They smile and examine the plants.</p>
            <p>　　Richard wanders a short distance away.</p>
            <p>　　Something glinting on the ground catches Richard's eye. He leans 
              down and picks it up. It is an empty brass cartridge from a rifle. 
              Richard looks around.</p>
            <p>　　Just ahead he sees the remains of an extinguished campfire, and 
              beyond that, protruding from the undergrowth, a pair of male legs 
              and beyond them, the butt of a rifle.</p>
            <p>　　CLOSE IN on the nest in the undergrowth. The legs and gun belong 
              to a Farmer. He is asleep. His physique is strong and his skin weathered.</p>
            <p>　　Richard turns back to Etienne and Francoise. They are still strolling 
              amongst the plants.</p>
            <p>　　Richard begins to back away.</p>
            <p>　　The Farmer wakes.</p>
            <p>　　He lifts his gun and stands up to look out over the dope field.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FIELD. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　There is no one there.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FIELD. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　The farmer looks around, sees nobody. His attention is attracted 
              by a whistle.</p>
            <p>　　He looks over. A group of three more, similarly armed Farmers 
              emerge from the forest at the other side.</p>
            <p>　　He waves at them. They beckon him across.</p>
            <p>　　He sets off through the field.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. AMONG PLANTS. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　The three inturders continue to crawl along the ground between 
              the plants</p>
            <p>　　Suddenly Richard stops. The farmer's footsteps come closer.</p>
            <p>　　His feet pass in the gap between Richard and Francoise. He pauses. 
              They lie frozen in place. He lights a cigarette and drops the match. 
              He moves on.</p>
            <p>　　They breath again.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. EDGE OF FIELD. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard, Etienne, and Francoise reach the far edge of the field 
              and enter the forest again.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　My God, what are we doing here?</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Shit. This was not on the map, Richard.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I didn't draw the map, Etienne.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　It's a fucking mess.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I didn't force you to come, so don't blame me.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　We should go back. It's too dangerous. We shouldn't be here.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Go back? How? Swim perhaps? Great idea. Back in the water? Well 
              fuck that. You swim back if you want to. Both of you. I'm not.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Richard - she is frightened. So am I.</p>
            <p>　　Richard looks at them. They await his lead.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Well, we're not going back.</p>
            <p>　　Richard smiles. The other two are still nervous.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O)</p>
            <p>　　Once again, I think you'll agree. A moment worth savoring. </p>

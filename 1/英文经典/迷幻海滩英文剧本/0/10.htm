            <p>　　Richard walks along the shore and begins to follow a bloodstained 
              furrow in the sand.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　The way I saw it, sharks live in the sea, so if you go swimming 
              where they live, they might eat you. That's what sharks are good 
              at, that's what they do. I could have explained this to Christo 
              but I just knew he wouldn't see it.</p>
            <p>　　Richard is standing over Christo who is lying in agony on the 
              sand.</p>
            <p>　　CHRISTO</p>
            <p>　　Richard! My foot. My foot! It's so painful. My foot!</p>
            <p>　　Richard looks at Christo's right leg: it has been bitten off 
              beneath the knee, leaving only a ragged bloody stump.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Yeah, your foot - it's - pretty bad.</p>
            <p>　　Christo clings to him.</p>
            <p>　　CHRISTO</p>
            <p>　　But it will be ok? Please Richard, when I get to the hospital?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Hospital?</p>
            <p>　　CHRISTO</p>
            <p>　　Tell me - it will be ok.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Yeah. Sure. Christo, it'll be ok.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. GRAVE STIE. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　A freshly dug grave in sandy soil about 1.5 meters deep.</p>
            <p>　　The corpse (Sten) in a sleeping bag is slung into the grave, 
              its feet protruding from the end.</p>
            <p>　　Immediately, the earth starts to be filled in from either side.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY (O.S.)</p>
            <p>　　We are gathered here today to pay our last respects to Sten. 
              I couldn't claim to know the bloke all that well but what I knew, 
              I liked. He was a straightforward, easy to get along with, reliable 
              sort of guy. He worked hard for the whole community - he even lost 
              his life fishing for us.</p>
            <p>　　Keaty is addressing the entire community beside the grave while 
              earth is heaped on.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　He made an effort to join in whatever was going on. For example, 
              he played cricket with an aptitude and enthusiasm that belied his 
              Nordic origins, and I think we can see that as a symbolic ofhis 
              place amongst us in a wider sense. Anyway, he wasn't one for long 
              speeches, and neither am I. May God take you soul, and you shall 
              rest forever in peace mate. We'll miss you.</p>
            <p>　　Keaty holds back a tear as he throws a flower in the grave.</p>
            <p>　　Others throw flowers in.</p>
            <p>　　Bugs hammers a wooden cross into the ground behind the grave.</p>
            <p>　　INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Christo is being nursed by Etienne who is mopping his brow, trying 
              to get him to drink etc.</p>
            <p>　　Several people are sitting around, inactive and silent.</p>
            <p>　　Christo moans. A couple of people get up and leave.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　After the funeral we all tried to get back to normal, but it 
              just didn't seem right. After a while it became clear that the problem 
              was Christo. You see, in a shark attack, or any other major tragedy 
              I guess, the important thing is to get eaten and die, in which case 
              there's a funeral and someone makes a speech and everyone cries 
              and says what a good guy you were, or: get better in which case 
              everyone can forget about it. It's the hanging around in between 
              that really pisses people off.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FOREST. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Etienne is backing through the forest. Outraged.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　This is disgusting! You cannot do this! Take him back!</p>
            <p>　　A party of stretcher bearers, including Bugs, Sal, and Keaty, 
              carry Christo through the forest. Sal is carrying a small rolled 
              up tent. Richard walks behind.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Ok, that's far enough.</p>
            <p>　　They lower Christo to the ground.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Take him back, you fucking animals!</p>
            <p>　　Sal drops the tent at Etienne's feet.</p>
            <p>　　The part walks away apart from Richard</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　Fucking bastards!</p>
            <p>　　INT. SMALL TENT. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Christo, delirious, is being nursed by Etienne in the small tent, 
              now situated in the middle of the forest.</p>
            <p>　　Richard is with him.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　It's not that they don't care, Etienne, it's just that they don't 
              care in the same way as you do. It's a fine distinction, I know.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　I understand: they wish he was dead.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　No! they've be equally happy if he recovered. They just want 
              an outcome.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　He needs a doctor.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　You worked in a hospital.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　For one month, as a cleaner, a domestic.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Well that's one month longer than anyone else around here. Look, 
              you're doing your best for the guy. No one could ask for more. Everyone 
              apprecaites that.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Look, Richard!</p>
            <p>　　Etienne draws back the sheet covering Christo's discolored stump.</p>
            <p>　　Richard recoils.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Jesus!</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　It's gangrene. It's spreading. He needs an amputation.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne produces a knife from his possessions.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　You're going to do it here?</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Where else?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　OK! I'll hold him still.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne prepares to proceed, but at the last moment he cannot.</p>
            <p>　　He drops the knife</p>
            <p>　　Richard relaxes.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　People are playing and relaxing on the beach and in the water, 
              shouting and swimming.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　It would be a lot easier to condemn our behavior if it hadn't 
              been so effective, but out of sight really was out of mind. The 
              bad smell was gone - it was like we had amputated Christo from our 
              community and after the operation was over, we felt a whole lot 
              better.</p>
            <p>　　UNDERWATER. DAY.</p>
            <p>　　In water one meter deep, moving forward with a smooth side-to-side 
              action, the POV of some underwater creature.</p>
            <p>　　Small fish scatter ahead of it.</p>
            <p>　　Suddenly a pair of legs come into view: they are Francoise'.</p>
            <p>　　Close right in on them at speed.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. SEA. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Francoise screams as Richard surfaces beside her, laughing.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Richard!</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　That's not funny.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Hey, relax, just a joke. What's wrong with you?</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　No, what's wrong with you? Why didn't you stop them moving Christo?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Francoise I just thought we ought to spend some time together. 
              We haven't had a chance to talk, and let's face it, it's going to 
              be a lot easier for us to do that if Etienne isn't hanging around 
              the longhouse.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　I don't believe it. You really think it was alright to move him.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　He was getting everyone down.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　I don't know what has happened to you, Richard.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I like it here! That's what happened! So what's the problem?</p>
            <p>　　Francoise turns and walks away.</p>
            <p>　　Richard calls after her sarcastically.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　We do still have something going don't we?</p>
            <p>　　She does not reply.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　So, it seemed that Francoise and I were finished. Under other 
              circumstances I might have got depressed about a think like that, 
              but I had something else to occupy my mind.EXT. BEACH. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Seen through binoculars, Zeph walks along the beach on the other 
              island. He is carrying a large piece of driftwood.</p>
            <p>　　He turns away from the water and walks up the beach towards the 
              line of palm trees.</p>
            <p>　　There he joins Sammy and the two German girls who are constructing 
              something from driftwood and polystryrene floats.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Richard is sitting with Sal.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　They're building a raft. It's nearly finished.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　When did they get there?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I don't know. Sometime during all that shark shit.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Well you'll have to stop them.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　They won't get beyond the DMZ.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　The what?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　The demilitarized zone, Sal.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Right. You call it what you want, Richard, just don't let them 
              get this far.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　They won't. Believe me.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　This is a particularly bad time, with Christo lying in that tent, 
              it wouldn't look good if anyone arrived.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　He's still alive?</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FOREST. DAWN. </p>
            <p>　　In the small tent, a torch glows, outlining Etienne and Francoise 
              over the prone form of Christo.</p>
            <p>　　Francoise emerges from the tent.</p>
            <p>　　Richard watches.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FOREST. DAWN </p>
            <p>　　On the upper part of the island Richard ascends rapidly beside 
              the stream.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. HILLTOP. DAWN. </p>
            <p>　　Richard surveys the beach on the other island.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. DAWN. </p>
            <p>　　Through binoculars.</p>
            <p>　　Zeph, Sammy, and the German girls launch their raft. It floats.</p>
            <p>　　They climb on and begin paddling.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FOREST NEAR DOPE FIELD. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard flits thorough the trees until he can see the shore.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　The travelers on their raft come ashore.</p>
            <p>　　They consult their map then move into the forest.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FOREST NEAR DOPE FIELD. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard watches them as they ascend the slope to the dope field.</p>
            <p>　　In the other direction, hidden from the travelers perspective, 
              he notices the four farmers sitting at their shelter eating breakfast.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FIELD. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　The travelers, watched by Richard, reach the top of the slope 
              and then the edge of the field.</p>
            <p>　　The farmers are nearby.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　If I was going to warn them, then now was the time to do it. 
              All I had to do was walk out and tell them not to make any noise 
              I could lead them to safety. I could persuade them to go. I could 
              threaten them. If the worst came to the worst, I could lead them 
              to the camp and we could kick the shit out of them, then send them 
              home. But I didn't want to do any of those things. I wanted to see 
              what would happen.</p>
            <p>　　Zeph, Sammy, and the German girls are jubilant.</p>
            <p>　　SAMMY</p>
            <p>　　We are in dope heaven. There is no other explanation.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　(singing)</p>
            <p>　　I smoke two joints in the morning. I smoke two joints at night. 
              I smoke two joints in the afternoon and then I feel alright. I smoke 
              two joints in time of peace and two in time of war. I smoke two 
              joints before I smoke two joints and then -</p>
            <p>　　Zeph stops singing. He has seen the farmers, armed and watching 
              him from a few meters away.</p>
            <p>　　Sammy and the others also notice, one by one. They too stand 
              still, dumb and frightened.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　Hi.</p>
            <p>　　SAMMY</p>
            <p>　　Shit.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　We're Americans. Tourists. But we will leave. We made a mistake. 
              We go now. We take nothing.</p>
            <p>　　Slowly, he begins to walk backwards, smiling reassuringly.</p>
            <p>　　The farmers say nothing but advance and outflank the travelers, 
              herding them back into a huddle.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　We go now. We leave in peace. Look we can pay. Here, American 
              dollars. You can have them.</p>
            <p>　　The farmers line up opposite them.</p>
            <p>　　All begin to plead desperately for their lives.</p>
            <p>　　One of the German girls suddenly breaks away and starts running 
              in the direction of Richard's hiding place. </p>
            <p>　　One of the guards shoots at her repeatedly, missing.</p>
            <p>　　The others start shooting at the remaining three, cutting them 
              down in a hail of bullets.</p>
            <p>　　The German girl keeps on running, zigzagging as she goes.</p>
            <p>　　The farmers fire but miss.</p>
            <p>　　She reaches the place where Richard is hiding, couched down in 
              the undergrowth.</p>
            <p>　　Startled by seeing him, she stops abruptly.</p>
            <p>　　Richard and the German girl stare into each other's eyes for 
              a moment.</p>
            <p>　　Suddenly her chest explodes forwards as a single bullet rips 
              through from her back.</p>
            <p>　　She falls to the ground.</p>
            <p>　　Richard is spattered in her blood.</p>
            <p>　　He sits motionless, staring at her corpse.</p>
            <p>　　UNDERWATER. DAY.</p>
            <p>　　In the pool at the base of the waterfall. It is empty.</p>
            <p>　　Richard appears, submerging at the speed from his jump.</p>
            <p>　　He sinks then floats slowly towards the surface, eyes open.</p>

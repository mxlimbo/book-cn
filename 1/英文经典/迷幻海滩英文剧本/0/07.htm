            <p>　　EXT. CLEARING. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Under a shelter in the cooking area, the Chef walks up to two 
              sacks of rice and slashes them open.</p>
            <p>　　He picks out two clumps of green, rotten mush and holds them 
              out towards Sal who stands nearby.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. CLEARING. DAY </p>
            <p>　　The inhabitants of the community are sprawled around the area, 
              generally facing towards Sal who addresses them. Francoise is sitting 
              with Etienne but turns to acknowledge Richard with a smile at some 
              stage.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Alright, I've got some bad news. As some of you may have heard, 
              a couple of sacks of rice have gone rotten. Now this is not a disaster 
              - </p>
            <p>　　VARIOUS</p>
            <p>　　Oh, no.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Yes, that's right: I need a volunteer to go to Ko Pha Ngan with 
              me to buy some rice. So please don't all volunteer at once.</p>
            <p>　　There are no volunteers. Everyone avoids Sal's eye.</p>

            <p>　　Richard?</p>
            <p>　　Richard has been scrutinizing Francoise's back.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　What?</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　What about you? Will you come to Ko Pha Ngan with me?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Sure. Yea. I'll come with you.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Great.</p>
            <p>　　She smiles at him.</p>
            <p>　　INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY </p>
            <p>　　Richard is sitting on his mat with a pencil and a piece of paper. 
              A line of people wait to pass him some crumpled baht and their order.</p>
            <p>　　Their recitals overlap.</p>
            <p>　　MAN 1</p>
            <p>　　Toothbrush, toothpaste, sixty cigarettes, a new hat, some elastoplast, 
              a pair of swimming trunks, four bars of chocolate and some razors.</p>
            <p>　　WOMAN 1</p>
            <p>　　One hundred aspirin, one hundred paracetamol, six boxes of regular 
              tampons, toothpaste, soap and some shampoo.</p>
            <p>　　MAN 2</p>
            <p>　　Toothpaste, a ball of string, four double-A batteries, and twenty 
              condoms. No, make it forty.</p>
            <p>　　WOMAN 2</p>
            <p>　　Six bars of chocolate, moisturizer, four boxes of tampons, assorted 
              sixes, two bars of soap and some toothpaste.</p>
            <p>　　MAN 3</p>
            <p>　　One tin of beef curry.</p>
            <p>　　WOMAN 3</p>
            <p>　　A newspaper, some boiled sweets, shampoo and conditioner, two 
              hundred cigarettes, a pair of plastic sandals, small, a new swimsuit, 
              size ten, bright but no flowers, a plain T-shirt, a jar of Vegemite 
              and three cigarette lighters.</p>
            <p>　　The last to sit down opposite Richard is Bugs. He sits close, 
              their knees almost touching.</p>
            <p>　　Richard is posed with his pen, ready to take note.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Anything I can do for you?</p>
            <p>　　Bugs smiles.</p>
            <p>　　His right arm whips out and he grabs Richard by the testicles.</p>
            <p>　　Richard buckles forward in pain.</p>
            <p>　　BUGS</p>
            <p>　　Yeah. When you get to Ko Pha Ngan, keep your hands to yourself 
              and your dick in your pants.</p>
            <p>　　He releases Richard.</p>
            <p>　　Preplexed and in pain Richard watches Bugs walk away.</p>
            <p>　　INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Everyone is asleep. Track along past the sleeping forms to stop 
              at Richard.</p>
            <p>　　The figure looking down at him is Sal.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. CLEARING. DAWN. </p>
            <p>　　Sal and Richard are walking away from the longhouse in the early 
              morning light. Sal has a small parcel of cannabis wrapped up in 
              a plastic bag.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Why are we leaving so early.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　If you hang around, people take advantage of you, give you orders 
              for all sorts of shit - clothes, condoms, Vegemite and God knows 
              what else.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Right.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　We go to Ko Pha Ngan, sell the dope, buy the rice, and come back. 
              That's all.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH / Water. Day. </p>
            <p>　　Sal walks into the water and begins swimming out towards the 
              cliff.</p>
            <p>　　Richard watches then dives into the water.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. LAGOON / CLIFFS. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Sal waits for Richard as he catches up with her at the base of 
              the cliffs inside the lagoon.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Over?</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Under.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Anything I should know?</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Don't breathe till you get to the other side.</p>
            <p>　　Sal submerges.</p>
            <p>　　Richard watches her disappear into an underwater tunnel into 
              the rock.</p>
            <p>　　He takes a deep breath.,</p>
            <p>　　UNDERWATER. DAY.</p>
            <p>　　Richard enters the tunnel, passing from the light into the dark.</p>
            <p>　　He enters near total darkness.</p>
            <p>　　Far ahead is a narrow point of dim light.</p>
            <p>　　He swims towards it.</p>
            <p>　　INT CAVE. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard surfaces, breathing deeply. He is in a cave within the 
              cliffs, from which a small entrance opens on to the sea beyond.</p>
            <p>　　Within the cave is a large flat rock and moored beside that is 
              a small narrow boat with an outboard motor.</p>
            <p>　　The ceiling of the cave is high and opening into it is a chimney 
              (which will be in use later). Additional light enters through this.</p>
            <p>　　As Richard surfaces, Sal is already in the boat.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Welcome to the garage.</p>
            <p>　　She pulls the start cord. The small engine's loud roar reverberates 
              around the stone walls.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. SEA / CLIFFS. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　The small boat emerges from the cave on to the sea, Richard at 
              the front and Sal at the helm.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　By the light of the moon, they come to land on a deserted stretch 
              of beach. Richard jumps into the shallows as Sal cuts the engine.</p>
            <p>　　Lights dance in the sky some distance away.</p>
            <p>　　Sal and Richard drag and shove the boat up the beach.</p>
            <p>　　The full moon shines brightly. The insistent beat of dance music 
              is heard.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　All the way I was sort of looking forward to the party, but when 
              we actually got there -</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH RESORT. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　The street is lined with bars each pumping out western music 
              on its own sound system.</p>
            <p>　　Richard and Sal walk along the strip.</p>
            <p>　　They turn towards a bungalow complex. Sal is still carrying the 
              parcel of dope.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　- I couldn't be bothered. It all seemed kind of trashy and out 
              of place. This was why we kept the secret. If these assholes ever 
              found out about our island they'd take just one night to spoil it 
              forever.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BUNGALOWS RECEPTION. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　The reception area is covered by an awning. An old warped pool 
              table stands in the center. Sal and the receptionist, SUMET, greet 
              each other and speak in Thai. There are no subtitles but when they 
              discus sthe number of rooms they indicate with their fingers: this 
              is not seen by Richard.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Good evening.</p>
            <p>　　SUMET</p>
            <p>　　Good evening, how are you?</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Very well, thank you.</p>
            <p>　　SUMET</p>
            <p>　　You brought something?</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　As always.</p>
            <p>　　Sal puts the parcel on the desk. Sumet weighs it in her hand.</p>
            <p>　　SUMET</p>
            <p>　　Good.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　We'd like to stay one night.</p>
            <p>　　SUMET</p>
            <p>　　Two rooms?</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　One.</p>
            <p>　　Sumet looks at Richard.</p>
            <p>　　SUMET</p>
            <p>　　A good choice. Young and strong.</p>
            <p>　　She squeezes his arm and laughs.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　She says she's got two rooms. No problem.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Great.</p>
            <p>　　INT. PHONE BOOTH. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Richard is in one of a line of booths in an international call 
              office/general tourist store.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I don't know. I just don't know. Maybe this year, maybe not. 
              I like it here. Things are different out here.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　I phoned home and discovered that I couldn't communicate. I realized 
              that I was no longer the person they knew.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　You don't understand.</p>
            <p>　　He hangs up.</p>
            <p>　　He steps out of the booth. On the other side of the store are 
              racks of patterned shirts and hats.</p>
            <p>　　Richard walks across and stares just beyond them.</p>
            <p>　　He is looking in a mirror, at himself, tanned and weathere-beaten.</p>
            <p>　　INT.SUPERMARKET. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Richard browses, selecting the items on his list, then spending 
              time choosing soap, eventually opting for a brand marked &quot;Genuine 
              French Soap&quot;.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　In fact the more I thought about it the more I realized that 
              none of this world made any sense to me. I'd left it behind. We 
              all had, and in its place we'd found somewhere special, and we were 
              determined to keep it that way.</p>
            <p>　　He drops the &quot;French&quot; soap in his basket.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　The music is far away now. Richard and Sal struggle along the 
              deserted beach to their boat carrying a pallet laden with sacks 
              of rice.</p>
            <p>　　They arrive and drop the pallet.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Now I understand why no one wants to come for the rice.</p>
            <p>　　INT/ EXT. BAR. NIGHT.</p>
            <p>　　The bar opens out to a street just back from the beach. It is 
              busy.</p>
            <p>　　Sal and Richard stand at the bar with their drinks.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　So how does it feel to be back in the world?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　It's not like I remembered it.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　It gets worse every time.</p>
            <p>　　A hand rests on Richard's shoulder, gently pushing him aside 
              to create space at the bar. It is Zeph.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　Excuse me, please.</p>
            <p>　　He does not see Richard's face but concentrates on the barman.</p>
            <p>　　Richard recognizes him and conceals his face.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　Excuse me! Four beers please. Heinneken.</p>
            <p>　　The barman serves him.</p>
            <p>　　Sammy and two German girls stand behind Zeph. He passes the drink 
              back to them and turns to speak.</p>
            <p>　　Richard and Sal listen in.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　(Continuing)</p>
            <p>　　OK, where was I?</p>
            <p>　　SAMMY</p>
            <p>　　The beach.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　Right, the beach: it's on this secret island, in the middle of 
              the national park where no one is allowed to go. It's paradise.</p>
            <p>　　GIRL 1</p>
            <p>　　Sounds cool.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　What's even better is we got the map of how to get there.</p>
            <p>　　GIRL 1</p>
            <p>　　Can we see it?</p>
            <p>　　SAMMY</p>
            <p>　　Sure. Let's go back to our place. We can smoke some dope, drink 
              some beer, loosen off these tight clothes we're wearing, then check 
              out the map.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　But hey it's secret - if we show you the map, you have to come 
              with us.</p>
            <p>　　They laugh. Zeph and Sammy high-five each other.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　Back in a minute. Just going to conduct a recon of the local 
              sanitation facility.</p>
            <p>　　Richard watches him leave the bar.</p>

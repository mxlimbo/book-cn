            <p>　　Richard climbs from the pool.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　So that was it. Now I knew exactly what would happen. I wouldn't 
              need to wonder aobut it any longer.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Richard walks across the deserted clearing towards the light 
              of the longhouse.</p>
            <p>　　Around him, a wind begins to blow.</p>
            <p>　　INT. LOONGHOUSE. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　The longhouse is full. Everyone is there, apart from Etienne 
              and Francoise, engaged in quiet conversation.</p>
            <p>　　Richard is hardly noticed as he sits down.</p>
            <p>　　A few seconds later, Sal sits opposite him. She is absolutely 
              matter of fact.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Well?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　They're dead.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　All of them?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Yes, all of them. They disturbed the farmers.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Right.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I guess that means we don't need to worry about them any more.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Yeah. The only problem we have left is Francoise and Etienne.</p>
            <p>　　Richard realizes what she means.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　You knew they'd be killed.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　It's not the first time.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　And Daffy?</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　What?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Daffy. He saw it happen. Didn't he? Yea, he saw it happen. And 
              now you wanted me to see it happen.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Richard, if you're going to live here, you've got to get involved.</p>
            <p>　　Richard's knife (the stolen one) is lying beside him. Sal picks 
              it up by the tip of the blade.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　Francoise. And Etienne.</p>
            <p>　　She slaps the knife into Richard's hand.</p>
            <p>　　She stands up and walks away.</p>
            <p>　　Richard contemplates the knife.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　A storm is building up, scattering anything loose across the 
              clearing.</p>
            <p>　　INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Most of the lights are out now. The wind is beginning to rattle 
              the building.</p>
            <p>　　Richard lies awake.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　I wasn't thinking about what she asked me to do.</p>
            <p>　　INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard and Daffy shake hands.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　I was trying to remember somewhere I used to call home, someone 
              I used to be, but I couldn't put a name to that place or a face 
              to that person anymore - they got left behind in a hotel room in 
              the Khao San Road along with a man who cut his wrists.</p>
            <p>　　INT. DAFFY'S ROOM. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard steps carefully across the floor, avoiding the pools 
              of blood.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　But at least I understood why he'd done it.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　It is pouring rain and the storm grows stronger.</p>
            <p>　　Richard appears alone in the clearing, the knife in his hadn.</p>
            <p>　　Thunder and lightening begin.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　I still didn't know what I was going to do when I got to them. 
              You see, when you have blood on your hands, you ask yourself, what 
              difference will it make if you spill some more? I had made a sacrifice 
              to keep the secret, and now that sacrifice was the secret.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Richard approaches the faint glow of the small tent where Francoise 
              is nursing christo.</p>
            <p>　　He is carrying the knife.</p>
            <p>　　He crawls close up to the tent. Etienne is sleeping in the open 
              doorway.</p>
            <p>　　INT. LONGHOUSE NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Inside there is darkness while all are sleeping.</p>
            <p>　　The thunder is directly overhead and the lightening flashes frequently.</p>
            <p>　　Sonja stirs in her sleep.</p>
            <p>　　In a flash of lightening she thinks she sees something.</p>
            <p>　　A whole series of flashes provide a clearer view.</p>
            <p>　　At the end of her bed four corpses, Zeph, Sammy, and the two 
              German girls, hang upside down and bound together from the central 
              beam in the roof of the building.</p>
            <p>　　Zeph appears to be staring at her, his hair trailing against 
              her feet.</p>
            <p>　　She screams.</p>
            <p>　　More lightening illuminates the four armed Farmers.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Richard crawls towards the sleeping Etienne.</p>
            <p>　　Inside the tent, Francoise has her back to the entrance as she 
              mops the brow of Christo, feverish and unconscious.</p>
            <p>　　INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　The farmers have torches now.</p>
            <p>　　One of them is interrogating Sal angrily in Thai while the other 
              inhabitants cower at gunpoint.</p>
            <p>　　FARMER</p>
            <p>　　You draw maps! You bring people here! Why?</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　No, we don't. We bring no one.</p>
            <p>　　FARMER</p>
            <p>　　You are lying! You are bringing people here. Too many people!</p>
            <p>　　He hits her with the rifle butt.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　No, I promise, we keep it secret. We tell no one.</p>
            <p>　　He hits her again.</p>
            <p>　　FARMER</p>
            <p>　　Then who drew this?</p>
            <p>　　He holds out the map drawn by Richard.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Richard draws closer to Etienne. He reaches him, the knife poised 
              in his hand.</p>
            <p>　　INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　The four bodies hang from the roof.</p>
            <p>　　The farmers have gone.</p>
            <p>　　Sal lies injured on the floor.</p>
            <p>　　The inhabitants silently pass the map from one to the other.</p>
            <p>　　It reaches Bugs last. He studies it.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Richard's bald is at Etienne's throat.</p>
            <p>　　He opens his eyes, frozen with fear.</p>
            <p>　　Richard is aware of a gaze from another direction. Keeping the 
              knife at Etienne's throat, he turns to see that Francoise is looking 
              at him. They stare at each other.</p>
            <p>　　Richard takes the knife away.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　You have to leave. Do you understand? You have to leave right 
              now. If you don't they'll kill you.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　What about Christo?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　There is nothing more you can do. I'll look after him.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Richard -</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　You don't have time to talk about this. You have to go now.</p>
            <p>　　Christo moans. Etienne looks at him.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　Leave him with me.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne understands. He and Richard stare at each other.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Bugs runs through the forest, away from the lights of the clearing.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Francoise and Etienne flee through the forest towards the beach.</p>
            <p>　　INT. SMALL TENT. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Richard studies Christo, illuminated by a torch.</p>
            <p>　　His breathing is labored and irregular.</p>
            <p>　　Richard reaches forward. He pinches Christo's nose and covers 
              his mouth.</p>
            <p>　　Christo's body struggles briefly and goes still.</p>
            <p>　　Richard relaxes his grip.</p>
            <p>　　He switches off the torch.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. LAGOON. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Richard swims out from the beach.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. LAGOON/CLIFFS. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Richard swims out towards the cliff.</p>
            <p>　　He reaches the cliff and pauses, taking a deep breath before 
              submerging towards the underwater tunnel.</p>
            <p>　　INT. CAVE. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Moonlight reflects in through the chimney and the entrance.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne and Francoise are in the boat.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne is trying to start the boat.</p>
            <p>　　He sees the silhouette of a man surface and crawl onto the flat 
              rock.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne steps off the boat onto the rock as the figure in the 
              shadows approaches him.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Richard, come one, get into the boat.</p>
            <p>　　The man pulls Etienne forward and stabs him deep into his abdomen.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　Richard!</p>
            <p>　　It is Bugs.</p>
            <p>　　BUGS</p>
            <p>　　Richard can't help you now, French boy.</p>
            <p>　　Francoise screams.</p>
            <p>　　Bugs releases Etienne who falls helpless to his knees.</p>
            <p>　　Bugs turns his attention to Francoise. She pulls the start cord 
              and the engine starts.</p>
            <p>　　Bugs holds one end of the mooring rope, pulling the boat towards 
              him while Francoise tries to undo the other end.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (O.S.)</p>
            <p>　　Hey, Bugs!</p>
            <p>　　Richard stands on the rock.</p>
            <p>　　Bugs turns towards him. He drops the rope and walks a couple 
              of paces, then rushes him.</p>
            <p>　　Richard manages to avoid the blade.</p>
            <p>　　They fight.</p>
            <p>　　Bugs forces Richard on to the ground</p>
            <p>　　He is about to stab Richard.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne appears behind Bugs, struggling on his feet, bleeding 
              from his wound.</p>
            <p>　　He is holding a piece of rope. He slings it around Bug's neck.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne's eyes roll and his head lolls.</p>
            <p>　　He falls back into the water, pulling Bugs with him.</p>
            <p>　　UNDERWATER. NIGHT.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne and the struggling Bugs sink.</p>
            <p>　　Bugs cannot free himslf, becoming only more entangled.</p>
            <p>　　INT. CAVE. NIGHT </p>
            <p>　　Richard lies on the flat rock.</p>
            <p>　　Francoise is in the boat.</p>
            <p>　　She switches off the engine.</p>
            <p>　　UNDERWATER. NIGHT.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne and Bugs lie at rest on the sea bed.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. SEA. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　A calm sunny day.</p>
            <p>　　Richard and Francoise are on the boat, drifting.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　That was the worst thing: I didn't even get to die. I had to 
              live with myself.</p>
            <p>　　INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　In a typical Khao San Road hotel. The room is a mess.</p>
            <p>　　Richard disheveled and haggard is sitting at a small table, working 
              with a pencil and a piece of paper.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　I haven't seen her since and I don't suppose I ever will. I've 
              been here six months now.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. CLEARING. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　The clearing is deserted and overgrown.</p>
            <p>　　The longhouse is derelict and overrun with creepers.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. ISLAND. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　From above in one rising shot, the beach, the lagoon, and the 
              island.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　Listening to all the people talk about where they're going to 
              go and ho great it's going to be, and I try to tell them: you can 
              go too far, you can find out too much, but no one ever listens, 
              no one ever listens. I guess there's some things you just have to 
              discover for yourself.</p>
            <p>　　INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　He finishes his work. It is a copy of The Map.</p>
            <p>　　He picks up a single tack.</p>
            <p>　　INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard pins the map to the door of an adjacent room.</p>
            <p>　　He walks back to the open door of his own room.</p>
            <p>　　He looks back once and closes the door.</p>
            <p>　　Close on The Map.</p>
            <p>　　 </p>
            <p>　　 </p>

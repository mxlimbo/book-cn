            <p>　　The toilet is a narrow concrete passage with a ditch along the 
              bottom on one side. There is no roof but a single light above.</p>
            <p>　　Zeph is just finishing as he notices Richard.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　Hey, Richard! I hardly fucking recognize you. Where have you 
              been? The beach? Tell me - it's paradise.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　There is no beach.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　What?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　The map is wrong.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　You've been?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　No. it's dangerous.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　Danger - hey, you're calling my middle name. What kind of danger?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Doesn't matter.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　I think you're trying to put me off.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I'm just telling you, for your own good: stay away. Don't go. 
              Don't even try. Just forget it.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　We'll do whatever we want.</p>
            <p>　　He goes to leave. Richard places a hand on his chest. They stop 
              for a moment. Zeph pushes the hand away.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　Fuck you.</p>
            <p>　　Zeph walks past then turns back.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　Stay away from the mushrooms, Richard, they make you paranoid.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BECH / STEPS. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Richard and Sal are climbing the steps towards the bungalow reception.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　That idiot Daffy? What was he doing - handing out Xerox copies 
              to every asshole in Thailand?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Yeah, it's unbelievable.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Why? That's all I want to know. Why?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I don't know, Sal.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Pardon me for this, but thank Christ he's dead.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BUNGALOWS RECEPTION. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Richard and Sal enter from the steps. Behind them the party is 
              still in progress.</p>
            <p>　　Sal approaches the desk while Richard hangs back.</p>
            <p>　　She greets Sumet who hands over one key.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Bad news.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　What?</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　She gave away your room. She thought we were - you know - together. 
              Sorry.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Right. Great. Well I'll go find somewhere else then. I'll meet 
              you back here in the morning.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Richard.</p>
            <p>　　She shows him the key for the room.</p>
            <p>　　They look at each other.</p>
            <p>　　SAL </p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　I'm going to play a couple of games of pool with Sumet.</p>
            <p>　　She throws the key. He catches.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　Why don't you go warm the bed?</p>
            <p>　　INT. BUNGALOW. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　The room is in darkness. Moonlight penetrates the threadbare 
              curtain. The bed is surrounded by a mosquito net.</p>
            <p>　　The music from the beach party is audible.</p>
            <p>　　Just visible through the net is the outline of two human forms 
              entwined.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BUNGALOW. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Lizards scuttle across the small porch.</p>
            <p>　　INT. BED. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Surrounded by a wall of mosquito net, Richard and Sal lie on 
              the bed.</p>
            <p>　　Sal lies on her side falling asleep. Richard is awake.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Sal.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Uh-huh.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Can I ask you a question?</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　It was great.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　No, it's not that. I just wondered about Bugs. And me.</p>
            <p>　　Sal rouses herself.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　OK, it's like this. Bugs is my boyfriend, my partner, and you, 
              you're someone I just screwed. Is that ok?</p>
            <p>　　She turns on her side again.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　That's fine. That's absolutely fine.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Good, now get some sleep - I may wish to have sex again before 
              we eat breakfast.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard and Sal push the boat into the water and away from the 
              beach, jumping on board as they do so.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. SEA/CLIFFS. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard and Sal approach the outer cliffs of the sea-wall in 
              the boat. Richard looks up.</p>
            <p>　　Bugs is standing at the top of the cliff, directly above the 
              cave.</p>
            <p>　　INT CAVE. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　The sacks of rice are now contained in a net being hauled upwards 
              on a rope towards and into the chimney which rises out of the ceiling.</p>
            <p>　　Sal swims away into the tunnel.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. CLIFF TOP. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Bugs and Keaty haul the rice up with the aid of a block and tackle.</p>
            <p>　　INT. CAVE. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard is alone as he looks up the chimney and watches the cargo 
              disappear the last few feet to the top of the cliff.</p>
            <p>　　As it reaches the top it is swung aside and Bugs looks down.</p>
            <p>　　Richard and Bugs stare at each other down the length of the chimney.</p>
            <p>　　Richard casually clutches his groin and thrusts once.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　Screwing Sal was pretty good but screwing Bugs - that was even 
              better.</p>
            <p>　　INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　The longhouse is full of inhabitants.</p>
            <p>　　Richard walks the length of the hut like Santa Claus despensing 
              toiletries and other gifts as requested.</p>
            <p>　　He reaches Francoise alone at the end of the hut.</p>
            <p>　　He gives her the &quot;French&quot; soap.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　For you.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　I missed you.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I'm back.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　What was it like?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　The rice run? No problem.</p>
            <p>　　FARNCOISE</p>
            <p>　　I mean being with Sal?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Oh´fine. Listen, do you want to go to the beach?</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　I can't. Meet me tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock at the waterfall.</p>
            <p>　　She touches him as she walks away.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　I didn't' feel as bad as I should have about all this. In fact 
              I didn't really feel bad at all. What happened on Ko Pha Ngan was 
              different, it didn't count.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FOREST/WATERFALL. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard is on his way to the waterfall.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　And I was glad to be back. Now I really did understand why no 
              one wanted to go for the rice. Life here was so good that going 
              back to the world we came from could only bring you down.</p>
            <p>　　He reaches the area by the waterfall and stands waiting. He looks 
              around for Francoise: no sign. He checks his watch: a few minutes 
              to ten.</p>
            <p>　　SAL (O.S.)</p>
            <p>　　Hi there, Richard.</p>
            <p>　　Richard turns to see Sal, who has appeared as though from nowhere.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Oh, Sal. Hi.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Hi? Is that all you can say? I thought we had a little more rapport 
              than that.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I mean, hello, nice to see you. What brings you here.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　I was looking for you.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Oh. Well, here I am.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　I have to go somewhere. I'd like you to accompany me.</p>
            <p>　　Richard checks his watch.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Right now? It's not really all that convenient, Sal.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　I'm sorry. Are you meeting someone?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Me? No.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　You sure?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Yes.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Good. So, you can come with me.</p>
            <p>　　(Unfortunately the copy of the script is now missing a page.)</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　If they reach the island, I want you to discourage them from 
              getting any further.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Discourage.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　You'll think of something, Richard. I trust you.</p>
            <p>　　Sal kisses him on the cheak and leaves.</p>
            <p>　　Richard watches her go.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Sal! How long do I - Sal!</p>
            <p>　　She does not turn around.</p>
            <p>　　Richard turns back towards the other island.</p>
            <p>　　He focuses the binoculars.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　The empty beach on the other island.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. HILLTOP. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard is not pleased.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Richard and Francoise are sitting in the shadows.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　She didn't tell me how long I was supposed to wait or anything. 
              You know what she's like, she just gets you to do things.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　What kind of things?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Just things, you know.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　No, I don't.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Hey, what's wrong - I'm sorry I wasn't there today. Is that it?</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　I think Sal is attracted to you.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　No, I don't think so.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　On Ko Pha Ngan, did anything happen?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Happen? No, nothing.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　You promise.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I promise.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Good.</p>
            <p>　　They kiss.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　Ok, so I lied. It just wasn't the right time.</p>

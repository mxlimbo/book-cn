            <p>EXT. CAVE HOME -- DAY</p>
            <p>Young Masbath, waiting by the horses, looks up. Through the trees, 
              black clouds billow and block the sun.</p>
            <p><br>
              CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY</p>
            <p>The old Crone slumps, still with her back to Ichabod. She does 
              not move. Wind howls through a hole/window. Rain.</p>
            <p>Candles blow out. Ichabod stands, worried.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Excuse me... um...</p>
            <p>She remains motionless. The STORM outside intensifies.</p>
            <p>WE SEE the skin of the Crone's wrists transform; swelling in the 
              cuffs, hardening, cracking and bleeding.</p>
            <p>Some thing Ichabod cannot see. He inches closer.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Are you alright... ?</p>
            <p>The Crone turns, hideous, leaping erect -- a half-human, half-demon 
              CREATURE. Its black clawed hands reaching.</p>
            <p>Ichabod recoils, crying out.</p>
            <p>Chains on restraining cuffs yank the creature back.</p>
            <p>Ichabod hits the floor, knocking over a table of bones. The creature 
              is chained, but still wants Ichabod. It SCREECHES.</p>
            <p>The Old Crone's face seethes from transformation, eyes blood red, 
              nostrils dripping, teeth now jagged.</p>
            <p>CREATURE/OLD CRONE<br>
              You seek the warrior bathed in blood... the Headless Horseman.</p>
            <p>Ichabod slides back as far as possible while the creature claws 
              the rock floor, yearning.</p>
            <p>CREATURE/OLD CRONE<br>
              Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies. Follow to the tree 
              of the dead.</p>
            <p>The creature pulls, testing the chains. Behind, the BOLT holding 
              the chains to the wall slips. The wall cracks.</p>
            <p>CREATURE/OLD CRONE<br>
              Climb down to the Horseman's soulless place and let loose his silent 
              shrieking. Do you hear? Do you hear?!</p>
            <p>Ichabod nods, quaking, aghast. He glances to the exit.</p>
            <p>The chain bolt gives more... coming loose...</p>
            <p>CREATURE/OLD CRONE<br>
              He who holds fast the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand. 
              Catch hold of his desire.</p>
            <p>Ichabod bolts for the door. The creature HOWLS, leaping...</p>
            <p>The chain bolt breaks...</p>
            <p>Ichabod cries out, tackled to the floor...</p>
            <p>It is the Old Crone who landed on him. She has returned to human 
              form, semi-conscious. Ichabod shoves her off.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. CAVE HOME -- DAY</p>
            <p>Ichabod runs out into the howling storm, past Masbath.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              We are leaving.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              What happened?</p>
            <p>Ichabod scrambles onto Gunpowder, heading further into the woods, 
              glancing back. Young Masbath follows.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- EARLY EVENING</p>
            <p>No rain. Dark. A lantern's glow creates shifting shadows as Ichabod 
              and Young Masbath ride.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies. To the tree of the 
              dead. (looking back)<br>
              Maybe we passed it by.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              How could something named &quot;the tree of the dead&quot; fail 
              to draw attention?</p>
            <p>A BIRD CRIES OUT. Ichabod's startled, looking up. The BIRD is HEARD 
              ALIGHTING. Leaves float downwards.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              We should not go much further in this murk.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Should we go back?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              We are far from the Hollow. (dismounts, troubled)<br>
              Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay 
              till morning.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. WESTERN WOODS (TIME CUT) -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Horses are tied. Ichabod is seated against a tree. A campfire burns. 
              Young Masbath lies on a blanket, rifle cross his chest, staring 
              to treetops.</p>
            <p>Leaves and branches shift in the wind. Bats fly wildly.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              &quot;Let loose his silent shrieking.&quot; who knows, till we work 
              at it? I admit not being anxious to find out. (pause)<br>
              &quot;He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping 
              hand.&quot; Whatever the Horseman desires, is, other than extinguishing 
              lives.</p>
            <p>A SNAPPING BRANCH. Ichabod raises his pistol.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (to Young Masbath)<br>
              Do not move.</p>
            <p>Ichabod rises. He creeps forward, pistol and lantern forward. Foliage 
              is thick. CRUNCHING LEAVES are HEARD.</p>
            <p>Ichabod crouches, puts down the lantern and picks up a branch. 
              He tosses the branch to the foliage...</p>
            <p>SOME ANIMAL darts away, a running blur.</p>
            <p>Ichabod rises, following with his pistol.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER ANGLE, MOVING P.O.V.: low to the ground, moving swiftly 
              at Ichabod...</p>
            <p>Ichabod spins, blindsided.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath fires his rifle -- CRACK!!</p>
            <p>The ANIMAL is KNOCKED DOWN mid-leap, yelping...</p>
            <p>The beast lands, a mass of grey fur.</p>
            <p>Ichabod comes to stare down. Young Masbath arrives. They both look 
              to the beast, horrified.</p>
            <p>The creature lies helplessly spastic; a TWO-HEADED WOLF, with one 
              head blown open to brain and gore. It's living head lifts, MEWING 
              sadly, eyes pleading.</p>
            <p>Ichabod steps up with pistol. FIRES. MEWING STOPS.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              What God-forsaken hell is this?</p>
            <p>Ichabod swallows back sickness, looking away. Something catches-his 
              eye.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Christ...</p>
            <p>Through the forest: the SKY'S LIT UP. Distant fire.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. WESTERN WOODS, CAVE HOME -- EARLY EVENING</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Masbath ride up, confronted by the Crone's cave vomiting 
              flame out all orifices.</p>
            <p>Ichabod approaches. Embers swirl everywhere. The Old Crone's body 
              lies amongst bloodied leaves. Headless.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Much commotion. A MOB in front of the home marked &quot;LANCASTER, 
              PHYSICIAN.&quot; Steenwyck addresses the rabble.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              You all stand idle, while this man goes about with a book of secrets 
              and a bag filled with magic. You all stand idle, while the shadow 
              of the Devil falls over our town.</p>
            <p>Baltus, Lady Van Tassel and Katrina watch at safe distance.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              I say, if you do nothing, you share in the blasphemy of Ichabod 
              Crane!</p>
            <p>Killian, on horseback beside his wife, BETH, and son, Thomas, rides 
              to one side of the shouting crowd.</p>
            <p>KILLIAN<br>
              Listen to me! Do you want to save your crops? Or would you rather 
              see your farms go to ruin?</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              How is he saving our farms? How? Ichabod Crane has brought into 
              our midst the soulless, moldering corpse of a heretic!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod examines the Crone's neck wound with magnification spectacles. 
              Young Masbath is seated, ledger in his lap.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              The wound is neither smooth nor cauterized, but jagged. She bleeds 
              like a fountain.</p>
            <p>Ichabod lifts her dead hand to show bruises and cuts.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              She did not go quietly.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Doctor Lancaster wrings his hands. His WIFE rocks nervously in 
              a rocking chair. The CROWD outside ROARS as a bonfire lights up 
              the curtained windows.</p>
            <p>The front door is POUNDED open. ANGRY HEN enter. Lancaster stands, 
              lips quivering. He points insistently to a door.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Angry men break in. Ichabod looks up.</p>
            <p>ANGRY MAN<br>
              Step aside, Constable. Step aside.</p>
            <p>Ichabod is shoved aside, spectacles knocked off.</p>
            <p>The group grasps the Crone. Masbath stands on his chair, clutching 
              the ledger. Ichabod grabs one man.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              What are you doing?</p>
            <p>The man slams Ichabod back.</p>
            <p>Magnification spectacles are crushed under foot.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Angry men carry the corpse to a raging bonfire. The mob makes way. 
              Steenwyck cheers them.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              Let her burn! Let her burn!</p>
            <p>Ichabod comes out, followed by Young Masbath. The Crone's corpse 
              is thrown in the fire. Cheers all around.</p>
            <p>At Ichabod's side, a man tries to grab the ledger Young Masbath 
              holds. Young Masbath cries out, hanging on to the book. Ichabod 
              joins the struggle.</p>
            <p>Katrina watches, emotions conflicting.</p>
            <p>Other men grab Ichabod. One punches Ichabod in the face.</p>
            <p>Katrina rides forward as Baltus calls for her to stop.</p>
            <p>Katrina leaps down, into the crowd, pulls men off Ichabod.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Stop this! Leave them alone!</p>
            <p>A SHOT RINGS OUT. Chaos halts. Everyone turns, quieting.</p>
            <p>The men around Masbath and Ichabod turn to face Brom Bones. Brom 
              holds a smoking pistol, flanked by Theodore and Glenn.</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              Let them go (pointing the pistol)<br>
              Are you going to beat an orphaned child, imbecile?</p>
            <p>Masbath is released, along with the ledger. Steenwyck moves forward, 
              pushing people aside.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              Are you Ichabod Crane's protector, Brom Bones?</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              Only for the moment.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              You side with him in this?</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              No. I agree he has only made matters worse. But, that will change, 
              if you listen.</p>
            <p>He trades with Theodore, pistol for a long rifle. Brom hefts the 
              rifle, taking a round slug from his pocket.</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              Theodore, Glenn and I offer to ride each day and night to watch 
              over the Hollow. We will stalk the border of the Western Woods and 
              haunt the Horseman for a change, with rifles like this... and slugs 
              like this...</p>
            <p>Brom brings the slug to his lips, blows. It WHISTLES.</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              Hollowed out and filled with powder.</p>
            <p>Brom smiles at Katrina, who watches unimpressed.</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his 
              side.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.</p>
            <p><br>
              BROM<br>
              You must have missed your mark.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I hit him square.</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              (to the crowd)<br>
              I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our 
              people, he's solid enough to feel this...</p>
            <p>Brom aims the rifle at a BARREL down the road. FIRES.</p>
            <p>PLUNK -- the barrel is hit -- EXPLODES. Smoke wafts.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>In bed, Ichabod is having unpleasant dreams once more.</p>
            <p>FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)<br>
              The night of the great storm, I saw her cross my windows.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY</p>
            <p>Young Ichabod is seated beside Father, eyes tearful. We are back 
              in the court where Mother stands trial.</p>
            <p>FREAKISH WOMAN<br>
              In the lightning, I did see her. (points to Mother)<br>
              Her. Lady Crane... I will never forget it. The next moment, I found 
              my infant son was dead, with the blood welt on his breast.</p>
            <p>The evil Third Man turns to a jury of TWELVE MEN.</p>
            <p>THIRD MAN<br>
              You have heard it. The blood welt is the mark of Satan's touch.</p>
            <p>As the crowd murmurs in fear, Young Ichabod looks to Father, who 
              sits with hands clenched, emotionless.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>In the quiet kitchen, Young Ichabod looks across the table. Father 
              stares into his food.</p>
            <p>YOUNG ICHABOD<br>
              She was with me, father.</p>
            <p>FATHER<br>
              Nothing can be done against them.</p>
            <p>YOUNG ICHABOD<br>
              She was with me that night.</p>
            <p>Father doesn't even look up.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Empty church. Young Ichabod carries a lantern past pews. A soldier 
              is seated near the altar with a rifle.</p>
            <p>YOUNG ICHABOD<br>
              May I see her?</p>
            <p>The soldier exits through a white door. Young Ichabod waits, looking 
              up at the vast church. The white door opens and the Third Man steps 
              out.</p>
            <p>THIRD MAN<br>
              Go home.</p>
            <p>YOUNG ICHABOD<br>
              May I see my mother?</p>
            <p>THIRD MAN<br>
              You do not want to be here. Go home to your father.</p>
            <p>YOUNG ICHABOD<br>
              She did not do it... please listen...</p>
            <p>THIRD MAN<br>
              She is guilty.</p>
            <p>YOUNG ICHABOD<br>
              No, sir, please... she is innocent...</p>
            <p>THIRD MAN<br>
              She has confessed.</p>
            <p>YOUNG ICHABOD<br>
              No.</p>
            <p>THIRD MAN<br>
              She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession. Do 
              you know what confession is? (off Ichabod's nod)<br>
              All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.</p>
            <p>The Third Man leaves through the white door.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- MORNING</p>
            <p>Young Ichabod buttons his shirt.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S YARD -- MORNING</p>
            <p>Young Ichabod comes out, looks to the lawn, not understanding. 
              Father loads a wagon full of belongings.</p>
            <p>FATHER<br>
              We are leaving. (long pause)<br>
              She has gone away.</p>
            <p>Realization comes to Young Ichabod. He runs, away across the lawn 
              as Father calls after him.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FOREST TRAIL -- MORNING</p>
            <p>Young Ichabod runs, weeping.</p>
            <p>THIRD MAN (V.0.)<br>
              She has confessed.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- MORNING</p>
            <p>Empty. Doors are thrown open and Young Ichabod enters. He goes 
              down the aisle, towards the white door.</p>
            <p>THIRD MAN (V.0.)<br>
              She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.</p>
            <p>YOUNG ICHABOD<br>
              Mother.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH, BEYOND WHITE DOOR -- MORNING</p>
            <p>Young Ichabod enters, halting. The room contains TORTURE DEVICES-: 
              iron cuffs, thumb screws, knifes and needles.</p>
            <p>THIRD MAN (V.O.)<br>
              Do you know what confession is?</p>
            <p>He walks, numb, eyes locked forward...</p>
            <p>In the corner is a SPIKED CHAIR, adorned with sharp iron spikes. 
              Hundreds of spikes. It is fitted with straps for holding down the 
              &quot;accused.&quot;</p>
            <p>Tears'stream down Young Ichabod's face. He kneels, hands on the 
              spikes of the chair, pressing hard.</p>
            <p>As he sobs, blood runs down from his hands.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>In bed, Ichabod opens tear filled eyes. He sits up, bringing his 
              trembling hands to wipe his cheeks. His hands trail blood. He looks 
              to them...</p>
            <p>The old scars are bleeding.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Katrina comes to the door. Ichabod is seated by the fire, eyes 
              bleary, palms wrapped with bloodied cloth.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Constable Crane?</p>
            <p>Katrina comes beside Ichabod's chair.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Allow me some time. I have spent every hour in the company of others. 
              I need to be alone.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              What troubles you?</p>
            <p>She moves in front. Ichabod gets up and crosses to sit facing away. 
              Katrina takes the chair he deserted.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              No, actually, you were not. Every word you spoke had truth in it.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              What has happened?</p>
            <p>Ichabod sits silent, puts his head back, eyes closed.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she? She bears 
              so little resemblance.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              What?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              She is not your birth mother, is she?</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              No, but... why do you ask that?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              What happened to your mother? Is she still alive?</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              She died. Her lungs were diseased... two years ago. What is this 
              about?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Memories have come back. I had them forgotten, and wish I could 
              forget them again... but they are here now. (pause)<br>
              Lord, how I hate this place.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              If you want me to go, I will. Do you want me to leave?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I ... I do not know. I no longer know what I think or what I feel.</p>
            <p>Katrina walks to him. She touches his back.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Why are you so afraid of that? Is there truly such harm in uncertainty?</p>
            <p>She kneels, smiles a little for him. She reaches to touch his face, 
              holds his head in her hands. Leans to kiss him.</p>
            <p>He rests his head against hers, weary, putting his arms around 
              her. They kiss passionately.</p>

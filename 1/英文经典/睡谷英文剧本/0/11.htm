          <td> EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE FRONT PORCH -- MORNING 
            <p>Baltus leads Ichabod to the porch.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting. This time he is determined 
              to have you forced out, or worse.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              How did you hear this?</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              He came to me. He promised great violence. Said I should cast you 
              out for my own protection.<br>
              (troubled pause)<br>
              I must speak honestly. There is no reason to think he will not meet 
              with success.</p>
            <p>Ichabod looks to barn, sees Masbath bringing the horses. The CHURCH 
              BELL is HEARD TOLLING far away.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              That is the meeting bell already calling. with the murder of Killian 
              and Brom, no one sees any good from you. If... if you were to leave... 
              you might be saving your own life.</p>
            <p>Ichabod studies Baltus, then offers his hand. They shake.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I appreciate your concern. I thank you, sir.</p>
            <p>Ichabod hurries off, across the lawn, exasperated. He runs. Masbath 
              runs to him. Ichabod takes Gunpowder and climbs up.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              (mounting his horse)<br>
              What now? Where is she?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill. Ride ahead, 
              find her and bring her to meet me outside the church. Find her at 
              all costs. Quickly.</p>
            <p>They ride, fast.</p>
            <p>EXT. FOREST -- DAY</p>
            <p>A conjuring pile of straw burns. Gloved hands unfold a paper filled 
              with clippings of human hair. The hair is sprinkled on the fire.</p>
            <p>A cloaked FIGURE is kneeled at the pile. The figure turns to remove 
              A human SKULL from a cloth bag.</p>
            <p>The skull is placed at center in the flames. It's teeth are sharp, 
              cut to points. The HORSEMAN'S SKULL.</p>
            <p>EXT. CHURCH -- DAY</p>
            <p>In the church yard refugee camp, food is prepared over fire. People 
              inhabit the tents.</p>
            <p>INT. CHURCH, STEENWYCK'S QUARTERS -- MORNING</p>
            <p>IN THE CHURCH: it's crowded with families. Pews filled with bedding 
              and belongings. Steenwyck comes to CLOSE the DOUBLE DOORS of his 
              quarters, turning, angry.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              You are astonishing, Constable. Do you truly think your ridiculous 
              accusations frighten me?</p>
            <p>Ichabod is doing nothing to hide his disdain.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Only if I repeat them outside this room. And, I will if I must...<br>
              (points to doors)<br>
              Out there, for all to hear. Or... you may speak, as planned. But, 
              you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              No. You will not run me out. No one will believe a word of what 
              you say.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Oh? Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              Are you a deist? Is that it? A free thinker who does not believe 
              in divinity.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              It is only important what you are. An adulterer...</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              I am the Lord's voice in this town.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Wallowing in sin and lust...</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              They need guidance.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Wallowing quite literally in blood.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              (snapping, quaking)<br>
              Damn you, sir! God damn you to hell!</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              He may. But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.</p>
            <p>Ichabod walks. Steenwyck is humiliated.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits 
              last night.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              You cannot do this. I am a man of God!</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father. That 
              is the closest you ever come to God.</p>
            <p>INT. CHURCH -- DAY</p>
            <p>Pews are packed. Steenwyck enters, walks to the altar. EVERYONE 
              QUIETS. Steenwyck has composed himself, barely.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              My friends... dear friends. Those of you still on your farms, I 
              thank you for coming.</p>
            <p>He sees Ichabod near the back. THUNDER is HEARD OUTSIDE.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              I ... I address unfortunate business.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              I am forced to take my leave from Sleepy Hollow. I will be moving 
              on to do the Lord's work elsewhere.</p>
            <p>The GATHERERS MURMUR shock. Ichabod walks out.</p>
            <p>EXT. THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY</p>
            <p>Raining hard. Baltus and Lady Van Tassel ride.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              Hurry along. The meeting has most certainly already begun. We do 
              not want Steenwyck as our enemy.</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel trails. WOOD is HEARD SPLINTERING...</p>
            <p>Just off the road, a tree falls...</p>
            <p>The trunk catches Lady Van Tassel's horse on its rear flank.</p>
            <p>The horse falls. Lady Van Tassel hits the dirt.</p>
            <p>Baltus looks back, halting.</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel looks up to Baltus in fear, then turns.</p>
            <p>Behind her, the Headless Horseman trots from, the forest on Daredevil, 
              stops. Calm. He takes his axe in hand.</p>
            <p>EXT. CHURCH -- DAY</p>
            <p>Storming. The meeting is letting out. Near the churchyard gate, 
              Young Masbath rides with Katrina following on a horse cart. Ichabod 
              walks up as Katrina dismounts.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              What is so urgent?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Come with me.</p>
            <p>Ichabod leads her to where they can talk away from others.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Why have I not seen your face for so long? You look much better.</p>
            <p>She touches his face, but he takes her hand, places the loan agreements 
              there.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Explain these. I found them secreted away in the sewing room.</p>
            <p>Katrina's expression changes just so slightly to guilt.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Why... why have I scrambled and run and clawed in all directions, 
              only to find you against me?</p>
            <p>He stares at her. Katrina stares back, in a small way defeated. 
              She looks for an out, but there is none.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry. I found it too fascinating 
              to resist.<br>
              (pause, ashamed)<br>
              I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity. Before 
              I found you though, I overheard what you were said.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              It was you there?</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could 
              not believe it. I had to hide these... at least till I could confront 
              him myself.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              And, what did he say?</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              He did not do these things. If you knew him, you would realize...</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              What did he say, Katrina?</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              I have not been able to face him yet.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors 
              are still on their farms. They could be thrown off... tomorrow... 
              a year from now.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              What would you have me believe?</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              (tiring, angry)<br>
              If you think I am behind this, say it.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              The name Van Tassel is blackened. You share that name.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.</p>
            <p>Many people are starting to notice the confrontation.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Katrina...</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Speak the words, Constable. What is stopping you? What has happened 
              to your ability to transcend sentimentality?</p>
            <p>Emotions tear at him. Rain seems to pound down harder.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Oh, no. No. Please... don't dare stand looking as if you still care 
              for me, after all that you have said. If I were to confess, would 
              that ease your suffering? Would that make it easier for you to hate 
              me?!</p>
            <p>A TORTURED CRY is HEARD O.S.</p>
            <p>Baltus comes charging through the square on his horse.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              The Horseman is coming!</p>
            <p>He's barely hanging on. He stops, practically falling off, running 
              towards Katrina and Ichabod.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              Save me...</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Father?</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              He killed her...</p>
            <p>Baltus grasps Katrina, fearful. HOOFBEATS are HEARD.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              The Horseman has killed her.</p>
            <p>Far behind, the Horseman rides to follow, axe held up. Instant 
              mayhem -- people scatter all directions, screaming.</p>
            <p>Baltus runs headlong to the church.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Father!</p>
            <p>Katrina runs after Baltus. Ichabod backs away, watching the Horseman 
              come, then heads to the church with Masbath.</p>
            <p>Baltus pushes through the iron gate, into tent city, joining the 
              swarm of townsfolk pouring into the church.</p>
            <p>The Horseman rides behind, closing the gap. men, women and children 
              run for cover all along the square.</p>
            <p>Amidst the churchyard panic, Ichabod looks back...</p>
            <p>The Horseman reaches the open gate and Daredevil suddenly rears 
              up, snorting, unwilling to enter.</p>
            <p>The Horseman grabs Daredevil's reins, tries to move forward again. 
              Same result. Daredevil freaks out.</p>
            <p>INT. CHURCH -- DAY</p>
            <p>Baltus makes his way in, shoving. People are still clamoring in 
              through the doors.</p>
            <p>Men pass rifles from stockpiles and climb onto pews at boarded 
              windows. Women herd children into a cellar.</p>
            <p>Baltus searches for a hiding place. He looks across the church 
              to see Steenwyck closing the doors of his living quarters. Baltus 
              moves...</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              Steenwyck!</p>
            <p>At the front doors, Katrina squeezes in with Ichabod and Young 
              Masbath just as people are forcing the doors closed. It's madness. 
              People outside begin pounding.</p>
            <p>Katrina searches.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Father!</p>
            <p>Ichabod goes to a window, looking out between boards.</p>
            <p>EXT. CHURCH -- DAY</p>
            <p>Across the yard, the Horseman gives his axe an underhand toss to 
              the ground inside the gate.</p>
            <p>The AXE instantly BEGINS TO DEGRADE. DUST in the rain.</p>
            <p>The Horseman rides, keeping outside the fence.</p>
            <p>INT. CHURCH -- DAY</p>
            <p>Ichabod comes away from the window, looking to panicked citizens. 
              He sees Katrina moving up the aisle...</p>
            <p>She's heading towards Baltus, who slams against the door to Steenwyck's 
              room.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              Damn you, Steenwyck! Help me! Let me in!</p>
            <p>RIFLES BOOM LOUDLY as men at the windows begin firing.</p>

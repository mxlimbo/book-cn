            <p>EXT. FORESTS -- DAY</p>
            <p>A black horse runs, hooves pounding the ground. THUNDER is HEARD. 
              The horse slows and stops... it is Brom's horse, with Brom aboard. 
              Brom looks skyward.</p>
            <p>The storm harshens, roaring through the trees. Distant HOOFBEATS 
              can be HEARD. POUNDING.</p>
            <p>Brom takes his rifle off his shoulder. The HOOFBEATS grow LOUDER 
              and PASS, far away. Brom turns in the saddle and WHISTLES. He kicks 
              his horse and rides.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY</p>
            <p>Thomas still watches shadow beasts, but sees something else. He 
              goes to the crack where hundreds of spiders flee all directions. 
              Thomas is amused.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY</p>
            <p>Behind Killian, mantelpiece stones pulse, breathing almost imperceptibly. 
              Demonic faces form, then disappear and reform again, shifting. WIND 
              HOWLS.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY</p>
            <p>Beth enters, looking at Thomas.</p>
            <p>BETH<br>
              What are you doing there?</p>
            <p>The magic lantern stops spinning. Shadow creatures freeze.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY</p>
            <p>The ENTIRE HOUSE CREAKS. Killian looks up. CREAKING STOPS. The 
              HOWLING WIND is LOUD.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY</p>
            <p>Beth comes to Thomas' side as he points.</p>
            <p>THOMAS<br>
              Spiders.</p>
            <p>Beth bends to see the swarming spiders. She looks up, noticing 
              the FEROCITY of the WIND.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY</p>
            <p>Killian stands, looking up. The HOUSE CREAKS again, then suddenly 
              the WIND CEASES. Silence.</p>
            <p>KILLIAN<br>
              Beth...</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY</p>
            <p>Beth picks up Thomas. The magic lantern creatures begin spinning 
              anew, all around.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY</p>
            <p>With a ROAR, the fire flares. Killian looks.</p>
            <p>WHHOOOSH the fire shoots up the fireplace. Gone.</p>
            <p>Behind Killian, the DOOR SPLINTERS INWARDS. The Horseman steps 
              in, a battle axe in each hand. WIND BLASTS...</p>
            <p>The DOOR to the other room SLAMS.</p>
            <p>Killian grabs a kitchen chair and hurls it at the Horseman. The 
              Horseman swings, smashing it aside.</p>
            <p>KILLIAN<br>
              Beth... run!</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY</p>
            <p>Beth hugs Thomas to her as she backs away.</p>
            <p>KILLIAN (o.s.)<br>
              (from kitchen)<br>
              Get out!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY</p>
            <p>Killian grabs an iron skewer from the fireplace, swings it to fend 
              off a blow from the Horseman.</p>
            <p>The Horseman swings the other axe. Killian ducks. The axe cracks 
              fireplace stone, throwing sparks.</p>
            <p>Killian lunges, jamming the skewer into the Horseman.</p>
            <p>The skewer comes through the Horseman's back. The Horseman swipes 
              with the flat of one axe -- pounding Killian aside.</p>
            <p>Killian hits the wall, bashing his head. Hits the floor.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY</p>
            <p>Beth kicks a carpet to reveal a trap door.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY</p>
            <p>The Horseman pulls the skewer out of his body, throws it. He goes 
              to lift Killian by the hair with one hand, brings back the axe in 
              the other...</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY</p>
            <p>At the trap door, Beth lowers Thomas to stairs leading to the cellar. 
              Thomas is crying.</p>
            <p>BETH<br>
              Don't let him get you.</p>
            <p>THOMAS<br>
              Mommy...</p>
            <p>BETH<br>
              You hide now... go...</p>
            <p>Beth closes the trap door, frantically replacing the carpet. The 
              room's door flies open and the Horseman strides in, carrying Killian's 
              severed head. Beth shrieks.</p>
            <p>The Horseman steps forward, knocks over the magic lantern.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY</p>
            <p>Beth's SCREAMS are abruptly CUT OFF. Her BODY is HEARD HITTING 
              the floor above. Thomas crosses the cellar, stumbles. He scurries 
              into the shelter of a wheelbarrow propped against the wall. FOOTSTEPS 
              are HEARD.<br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY</p>
            <p>The Horseman's hands place Killian's and Beth's heads in a sack, 
              cinching the sack shut.</p>
            <p>INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY</p>
            <p>The Headless Horseman enters, bends to retrieve the battle axe 
              he left. He stands. Pause.</p>
            <p>INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY</p>
            <p>Thomas' trembling hands pull the wheelbarrow closer. QUIET. He 
              tries to control his sobbing.</p>
            <p>INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY</p>
            <p>The Horseman turns, falls to his knees. He starts to chop at the 
              floor with both axes. CHOPping, CHOPping, CHOPping... making quick 
              work of it...</p>
            <p>INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY</p>
            <p>A hole appears in the ceiling as debris falls.</p>
            <p>Thomas looks up, terrified. He gets up to run away...</p>
            <p>The Horseman's arm shoves through above, grasping Thomas and yanking 
              him up.</p>
            <p>EXT. KILLIAN'S FARM -- DAY</p>
            <p>Brom rides from the forest, charging across Killian's field.</p>
            <p>At Killian's house, Daredevil rides up as the Headless Horseman 
              walks out with his sack of heads. The Horseman ties the sack to 
              the saddle and leaps up-.</p>
            <p>Brom puts his reins in his mouth, raising his rifle.</p>
            <p>The Horseman heads away, past the barn, as Brom gains.</p>
            <p>Brom aims... FIRES!</p>
            <p>BOOM -- the slug EXPLODES, blowing the Horseman off Daredevil. 
              Daredevil keeps going. The Horseman's smoldering body is left &quot;face 
              down.&quot;</p>
            <p>Brom halts his horse. He climbs down, pleased.</p>
            <p>The Horseman moves.</p>
            <p>Brom backs away, satisfaction diminishing.</p>
            <p>The Horseman gets on his knees.</p>
            <p>Brom falls to one knee, begins reloading. He fills the gun from 
              his powder horn.</p>
            <p>The Horseman stands, unsheathes his sword and turns. The blast 
              has blown apart his uniform at the chest and shoulder, exposing 
              rotten flesh and maggot-infested muscle.</p>
            <p>Brom readies his ramrod, jamming powder in the barrel.</p>
            <p>The Horseman charges.</p>
            <p>Brom stands, pulling out the ramrod. The Horseman is on him. Brom 
              swings the rifle, blocking. Sparks fly.</p>
            <p>The battle is on, with Brom fending off the Horseman's sword with 
              the gun - CLANK - CLANK - CLANK.</p>
            <p>ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod and Gunpowder break into the open.</p>
            <p>UP THE FIELD, the Horseman makes a backhanded swing. Brom goes 
              down, his rifle sent flying.</p>
            <p>Brom rolls to avoid as the Horseman slashes.</p>
            <p>Brom flees. The Horseman pulls and throws a knife...</p>
            <p>THWAP -- the knife imbeds in Brom's thigh.</p>
            <p>The Horseman runs towards Brom.</p>
            <p>Ichabod closes in, pulling an unlit lantern off his saddle.</p>
            <p>Brom tries to get up, bends to extract the knife.</p>
            <p>The Horseman, mid-run, changes his sword grip, blade down.</p>
            <p>He plants one foot on Brom's back, raising his sword, about to 
              skewer...</p>
            <p>Ichabod arrives full gallop, SMASHES the lantern into the Horseman 
              -- knocking the Horseman off Brom.</p>
            <p>AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST, Theodore and Glen arrive on horseback. 
              They hold a moment, watching.</p>
            <p>Brom runs, limping, to the barn, goal in sight: farm implements 
              propped there. Brom grabs SCYTHES with long curved blades, one in 
              per hand.</p>
            <p>The Horseman rises.</p>
            <p>Ichabod turns Gunpowder and leaps off, runs to Brom.</p>
            <p>The Horseman moves towards them, hefting a battle axe in his free 
              hand. Ichabod steps up, pistol aimed, furious.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              For what it's worth...</p>
            <p>FIRES -- the bullet rips through the Horseman's stomach to reveal 
              putrid innards as he keeps advancing.</p>
            <p>At the forest, Theodore looks to Glenn, turns and flees.</p>
            <p>Brom steps up, scythes ready. He and the Horseman go at it. Brom 
              blocks axe and sword, catching and deflecting blows.</p>
            <p>At the forest, Glenn follows Theodore away.</p>
            <p>Ichabod-grabs a long handled SICKLE.</p>
            <p>Brom swings the scythes. The Horseman avoids.</p>
            <p>Ichabod moves to the side, looking for an opening. He swings the 
              sickle. The Horseman blocks.</p>
            <p>The Horseman battles both at once, catching blows... countering 
              every strike, METAL RINGING.<br>
              Brom catches the Horseman's sword in one scythe, holding it off. 
              Catches the axe handle in the other scythe.</p>
            <p>The Horseman flatfoot KICKS Brom's chest, sending him down.</p>
            <p>Ichabod swings the sickle blade...</p>
            <p>Hits the Horseman, the blade embedding to the hilt.</p>
            <p>The Horseman drops his axe and grasps the sickle, jerking...</p>
            <p>The sickle handle SLAMS Ichabod's, knocking him away.</p>
            <p>Ichabod crawls, tries to shake off the blow.</p>
            <p>He looks up. The Horseman staggers, spastically trying to pull 
              the blade from his body.</p>
            <p>Brom limps to Ichabod, yanks him to his feet.</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              We cannot win this.</p>
            <p>They head towards the forest.</p>
            <p>Behind, the Horseman extracts the sickle, throws it. He strides 
              after them, picks up his axe on the way.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. RIVERBANK -- DAY</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Brom stumble down a hillside. Brom points.</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              There...</p>
            <p>They run to a DOCK at the edge of a wide, rapid river. They jump 
              into a FLAT BOAT barge.</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              Go to the front and guide it.</p>
            <p>Ichabod goes. Brom uses a scythe to slash the ropes.</p>
            <p>Ichabod picks up a GUIDE POLE. The barge lurches, set free.</p>
            <p>Ichabod struggles to push the boat out. it moves swiftly, caught 
              in rain swollen current.</p>
            <p>Brom looks back. No Horseman. He leaves the scythe and moves to 
              the front, hefting another pole to help guide.</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              Let's see him catch us now.</p>
            <p>Ichabod looks to the shore. Horror.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Look.</p>
            <p>LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES -- ahead, the Horseman stands on the bank 
              with Axe and sword. Daredevil near.<br>
              BROM<br>
              We'll pass right by the son of a bitch.</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Brom push with the poles, trying for speed.</p>
            <p>At the bank, the Horseman walks directly to the water...</p>
            <p>Just as he takes a step-onto the water, the rain churned surface 
              TRANSFORMS -- instantly BECOMING a SHEET of ICE...</p>
            <p>SPREADING and supporting the Horseman as he advances.</p>
            <p>ICE SHOOTS OUT ahead of him, towards a point in the river where 
              it will intercept the barge.</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              My Christ...</p>
            <p>The Horseman's ICE BRIDGE engulfs the barge, HALTING IT.</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Brom are thrown. The barge is trapped.</p>
            <p>The Horseman nears.</p>
            <p>Brom runs to the rear to retrieve his scythe. Ichabod holds up 
              the only weapon he has, his guide pole.</p>
            <p>The Horseman steps on board. Ichabod swings. The Horseman's axe 
              cracks the pole in half...</p>
            <p>The Horseman thrusts with sword -- into Ichabod's chest -clean 
              through. It SIZZLES as Ichabod screams.</p>
            <p>The Horseman lifts Ichabod up, flips him, pulling the sword out 
              as Ichabod goes...</p>
            <p>SMASHING through the ice and under.</p>
            <p>UNDERWATER: water carries Ichabod, slams him against ice above. 
              He's pulled down by undertow.</p>
            <p>ABOVE WATER, beyond the edge of the ice bridge: Ichabod comes up, 
              gasping, choking on rain.</p>
            <p>He treads water, looking to the barge.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD'S P.O.V. -- FROM THE WATER</p>
            <p>Aboard the barge, the Horseman cuts Brom down... stands over him, 
              chopping with sword. Our VIEW grows BLURRY, and...</p>
            <p>FADES OUT/IN</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Candlelight. Ichabod, shirtless, feverish, opens his eyes. The 
              wound at the top of his chest is raw. Katrina inserts a needle in 
              the skin around it.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Lay still, Ichabod. Do not move.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              Doctor, he is awake.</p>
            <p>Ichabod tries to sit. Pain stops him. Lady Van Tassel helps bleed 
              the wound with the needle and a tube leading to a SUCTION JAR of 
              blood.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (barely a voice)<br>
              What... what are you doing... ?</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.</p>
            <p>Doctor Lancaster comes to the bed.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER<br>
              Keep still, Constable. You were half-drowned when they found you.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Brom Bones...?</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER<br>
              He is dead. You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Bring Young Masbath here.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER<br>
              You need to sleep.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Bring him.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER<br>
              You need rest.</p>
            <p>Ichabod gives up, closes his eyes. Katrina, needle in one hand, 
              brings her other hand to hold Ichabod's.</p>
            <p>Blood drips into the suction jar.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- LATER NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod is soundly asleep. Across the room, Katrina is at his work 
              table. Ichabod stirs. Katrina looks to him.</p>
            <p>Once she is satisfied he will not wake, she returns to what she 
              was doing, turning a page. She is reading his ledger.</p>
            <p>EXT. SERVANT'S QUARTER'S, MASBATH'S ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Young Masbath lies awake. A glint of light crosses the window. 
              Masbath looks to it, gets up, peers out.</p>
            <p>THROUGH THE WINDOW, he can see the Van Tassel Manor House in the 
              distance. Lantern LIGHT crosses the lawn.</p>

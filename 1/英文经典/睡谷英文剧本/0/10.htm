          <td> EXT. VAN TASSEL ESTATE, ORCHARD -- NIGHT 
            <p>The lantern light moves through the orchard, away from the house. 
              We cannot make out the person.</p>
            <p>Elsewhere, Young Masbath runs in pursuit. He hides against one 
              tree, leans to look...<br>
              The light enters forest. Young Masbath follows.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- MORNING</p>
            <p>Ichabod's hurting. Masbath helps with a shirt.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Someone left last night. Looked like they headed to the square, 
              but I lost them in the forest.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Man or woman?</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              All I saw was their lantern.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.</p>
            <p>Ichabod goes to his work table, organizing his satchel.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, 
              then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our 
              murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales 
              of a galloping ghoul.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted. What was 
              taken from them... other than their lives? who benefits by their 
              deaths?</p>
            <p>Ichabod fumbles the bottle of white powder.</p>
            <p>It bounces, cork popping out... rolls under the bed.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Damn it.</p>
            <p>Ichabod kneels, pained. A trail of the blood-detecting powder has 
              spilled. The bottle is out of reach.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              I'll get it.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath gets down, ready to crawl for it, but Ichabod stops 
              him, peering under.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Wait...</p>
            <p>Far under, near the bottle, some powder is bubbling.</p>
            <p>Ichabod moves to the end of the bed and lifts, in pain. Young Masbath 
              helps. They drag the bed to one side.</p>
            <p>Under the bed: a Satanic PENTAGRAM has been DRAWN IN BLOOD.</p>
            <p>Ichabod stares, trying to grasp the implication. Masbath is about 
              to speak, but Ichabod puts a finger to his lips.<br>
              Ichabod moves to lock the door.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              (whispers)<br>
              Who did this?</p>
            <p>Ichabod does not answer. He picks up a wash basin and dumps the 
              water to wash the Pentagram away.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- DAY</p>
            <p>WAGONS, HORSES and TOWNSPEOPLE swarm. A CROWD loots the town's 
              general store. Provisions are passed along man to man and loaded 
              on wheelbarrows.</p>
            <p>All up and down the long straight road, homeowners board up windows 
              with lumber.</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Young Masbath ride, passing many angry faces.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Panic has set in.</p>
            <p>They stop, tying their horses and climbing stairs to the door of 
              the &quot;NOTARY.&quot; Ichabod looks off...</p>
            <p>DOWN THE ROAD, at the far end, people head to the church. Much 
              activity there as well.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Sanctuary. Or, so they hope.</p>
            <p>Families put up tents all around the church within the bordering 
              wrought-iron fence. Supplies abound.</p>
            <p>People work to build and erect massive wooden crosses.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. NOTARY PUBLIC, HARDENBROOKIS OFFICES -- DAY</p>
            <p>Tidy room. Young Masbath watches Ichabod hand a slip of paper to 
              the elderly Notary, Hardenbrook.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Do you have these persons wills?</p>
            <p>HARDENBROOK<br>
              I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death 
              certificates... deeds.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Yes, sir... but, do you have these?</p>
            <p>Hardenbrook studies the paper with his one good eye.</p>
            <p>HARDENBROOK<br>
              Certainly... certainly.</p>
            <p>Hardenbrook nods, handing the list back, grinning. Ichabod stands 
              waiting. Hardenbrook is still nodding.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?</p>
            <p>HARDENBROOK<br>
              Hmm? See them?<br>
              ICHABOD<br>
              May we look at them now?</p>
            <p>HARDENBROOK<br>
              Of course. You want them... it shall not take long. Wait here.</p>
            <p>Hardenbrook heads across the room. Ichabod offers the list.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Maybe you should take this.</p>
            <p>HARDENBROOK<br>
              A fine idea.</p>
            <p>Hardenbrook takes it and exits. Young Masbath sits.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              What good is this?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will 
              help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.</p>
            <p>Ichabod waits. After a moment, he looks uncertain. He crosses to 
              the half-open door...</p>
            <p>INT. NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM -- DAY</p>
            <p>Ichabod sticks his head in, not liking what he sees.</p>
            <p>Hardenbrook's amidst unbelievable disarray. Tables, shelves, and 
              baskets of unevenly piled documents.</p>
            <p>Hardenbrook looks on a shelf, confused, then goes to a table, lifting 
              papers, mumbling.</p>
            <p>HARDENBROOK<br>
              Damn... damn... damn...</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Master Hardenbrook...</p>
            <p>Hardenbrook turns, a bit startled.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?</p>
            <p>HARDENBROOK<br>
              Well... that might be... helpful.</p>
            <p>INT. NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM (TIME CUT) -- DAY</p>
            <p>Hardenbrook is asleep in a chair, snoring, blind eye open. Ichabod 
              and Young Masbath face official-looking documents, with Ichabod 
              focused on one will in hand.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              My father had farm land. It was the only thing we owned of any value.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (still reading)<br>
              And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus. I heard him say 
              it.<br>
              YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p>Ichabod turns the will in his hand to Masbath.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Then look here at your father's will, and tell me why you are not 
              listed.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath takes it, boggled. Ichabod grabs another.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Van Garrett had denoted his elder son in his last wishes; the same 
              son murdered along with him. But Van Garrett's wife and two infant 
              children are not written... and they were spared.<br>
              (picks up another will)<br>
              Do you see? Philipse had no family to bestow his farm to. But, here...<br>
              (picks up another)<br>
              The Widow Windsor was listed on her late husband's will. After her 
              inheritance, she amended the document to include her bastard child. 
              This is why the Horseman made absolutely certain to impale the unborn 
              descendant.</p>
            <p>Ichabod sits back.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Only the heirs were killed. Proof that the Horseman slaughters by 
              assignment.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              No one yet, far as I can tell. it has gone intestate.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              In-test... what?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Intestate. Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              What does it mean?</p>
            <p>Ichabod stares off.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes 
              to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town 
              is owed a great many debts?</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              (realization)<br>
              Baltus Van Tassel.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Did your father take a loan?</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Yes. I rode with him on payment days.</p>
            <p>Ichabod stands, grim, gathering wills and his ledger.<br>
              ICHABOD<br>
              Tonight, we answer questions. And, to discover who moves about the 
              Van Tassel house after dark... all we need is a candle.</p>
            <p>A LOUD NOISE is HEARD from the other room. Ichabod looks.</p>
            <p>INT. HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY</p>
            <p>Ichabod bursts in. No one there. A chair has been knocked over 
              and the front door is ajar. Ichabod moves...</p>
            <p>EXT. NOTARY -- DAY</p>
            <p>Ichabod exits. All around is the commotion in the square as before. 
              No telling who it was who just fled.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY</p>
            <p>Young Masbath is seated, bored. Ichabod writes in his ledger. A 
              KNOCK on the door. They both look up.</p>
            <p>KATRINA (o.s.)<br>
              (from outside door)<br>
              Constable... are you there?<br>
              (long pause)<br>
              Ichabod?</p>
            <p>The knob is tried and found locked. Pause. At the bottom of the 
              door, a red rose is passed under.</p>
            <p>This saddens Ichabod.</p>
            <p>EXT. CHURCH -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Quiet night. The church is a sight, with a yard resembling an empty 
              squatter's tent city, surrounded by crosses. Boarded over windows 
              leak shafts of light.</p>
            <p>MOVING PAST THE WINDOWS: many eyes peer out from the slats.</p>
            <p>UP IN THE BELFRY, TWO RIFLEMEN are on watch.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Masbath are in darkness, still waiting. Ichabod takes 
              the cover off a lantern, looks at a clock. Midnight, straight up. 
              Ichabod stands, picks up an unlit candle.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Midnight seems an appropriate time.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Young Masbath look out, cautious. They move to the 
              nearest door.</p>
            <p>Ichabod crouches, using the candle to mark the seam of the door 
              and door frame. He's making a low, wax seal. If the door opens, 
              the seal will break.</p>
            <p>They move to a second door, quietly. Ichabod makes another low 
              wax mark.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, MAIN ENTRANCE -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs to a hall. Ichabod continues 
              his wax marking at each door.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, BALTUS' OFFICE -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Young Masbath enter, shutting the door. Ichabod walks 
              to shelves at Baltus' desk, looks through ribbon bound DOCUMENTS 
              and hands some to Masbath.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath pulls off the ribbon, pages through these &quot;LOAN 
              AGREEMENT&quot; parchments. Ichabod brings another pile.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (whispering)<br>
              They are alphabetical.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath has the M's. &quot;MARYIE,&quot; &quot;MEGAPOLENISIS,&quot; 
              AND &quot;MELYN...&quot; Not finding what he wants.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              There is no Masbath here. My father's loan papers are missing.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (regarding his documents)<br>
              There are none for Magistrate Philipse either. &quot;Paasch, James&quot; 
              &quot;Pieter, Thomas&quot; &quot;Pos, William.&quot;</p>
            <p>A FLOORBOARD CREAKS. Ichabod looks, blows out the lantern. He and 
              Young Masbath stand frozen.</p>
            <p>Across the room, light comes under the door, stops, then continues. 
              A DOOR is HEARD OPENING and SHUTTING. Ichabod crosses to follow, 
              pointing back.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Keep looking. Then, hide in my room and bolt the door till I return.</p>
            <p>EXT. FOREST -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Lantern light moves, far ahead. Ichabod follows.</p>
            <p>EXT. FOREST, FURTHER ON -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod stops, hidden. He can see the light ahead, but it is no 
              longer in motion. He advances.</p>
            <p>EXT. FOREST CLEARING -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>A lantern sits on a rock. on a blanket, a semi-naked MAN and semi-naked 
              WOMAN are in the midst of rough SEX.</p>
            <p>Ichabod crawls to peer from underbrush.</p>
            <p>The couple keeps coupling, with the man on top. His grunts and 
              gasps are particularly desperate. He's all over the woman, who lays 
              back... it is Lady van Tassel.</p>
            <p>Ichabod swallows, inches closer.</p>
            <p>Lady van Tassel pulls the man's shirt, exposes his flesh. She-raises 
              a small, sharp KNIFE behind his back.</p>
            <p>Ichabod's eyes widen.</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel brings the blade to her own hand, slicing deep 
              in her palm. Blood flows. She rubs her cut hand over her partner's 
              arching back, smearing blood.</p>
            <p>Lady van Tassel caresses the man's chest, neck, face... trailing 
              blood. The man lifts his head, in ecstasy, sucks the woman's bloody 
              fingers... it's Clergyman Steenwyck.</p>
            <p>Ichabod backs away, having seen more than plenty.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Young Masbath unlocks the door. Ichabod enters.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              I was getting worried. Who was it?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Lady Van Tassel.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              What was she doing?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it. Did you find 
              the victims' loan agreements?</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              No. They are all missing.</p>
            <p>This troubles Ichabod.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              There is more, though. while you were gone, I could hear someone 
              else walking through the house.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Young Masbath creep round a corner. Going to the LAST 
              DOOR, Ichabod crouches, eyes narrowing...</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (whispers, to himself)<br>
              Katrina.</p>
            <p>The wax seal is broken, flecks of wax on the floor.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER AND HALL -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs, checking all the wax marks. 
              Young Masbath finds one broken.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Here.</p>
            <p>Ichabod comes over, pushes the door...</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>They enter. The kitchen is empty. Ichabod crosses to another door, 
              crouches. Another broken wax mark.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>They enter... the room with the elaborate loom. Ichabod moves his 
              lantern to make a quick search, goes to table.</p>
            <p>He touches the top of a candle. His finger comes away with a bit 
              of still wet wax.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              There are no other doors. This is as far as she could have gone.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              It is nothing. She comes to read books, so her father will not find 
              her.<br>
              (to convince himself)<br>
              It is absolutely nothing.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              What books?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Fiction plays and novels. Baltus does not approve. Now, come. It 
              may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              But, sir... what books? Where are they?</p>
            <p>Ichabod stops, looking around. No books anywhere.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              If there is a secret place for books... it could be just as good 
              for the missing loan agreements.</p>
            <p>Ichabod ponders this without saying anything.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- LATER NIGHT</p>
            <p>SEARCH MONTAGE:</p>
            <p>- Drawers are opened and searched, quietly.</p>
            <p>- Young Masbath uses a candle to look up the fireplace.</p>
            <p>- Ichabod opens a linen cabinet, unfolding blankets.</p>
            <p>- Young Masbath looks in a closet filled with big spools of sewing 
              thread. on his knees,, pulls a wooden box forward. Inside it, he 
              finds only old cups and silverware.</p>
            <p>Ichabod pulls up a rug, feeling along the floorboards.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath crawls, doing the same. He climbs under the loom, 
              tapping on the floor. TAP... TAP... TAP ...</p>
            <p>He crawls further under the loom. TAP... TAP ... PLONK. A hollow 
              sound. He taps again... PLONK... PLONK.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Constable.</p>
            <p>Ichabod comes over as Young Masbath lifts a loose board. Under 
              the floor, there are piles of books. Masbath brings them up, handing 
              them to Ichabod, who studies the spines.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath reaches in up to his shoulder. He comes up with &quot;LOAN 
              AGREEMENTS.&quot;</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Fie!. Here they are.</p>
            <p>Ichabod takes them. Names are near the top: &quot;Masbath,&quot; 
              &quot;Van Garret,&quot; &quot;Philipse,&quot; and &quot;Killian.&quot;</p>
            <p>Ichabod sits back, numb, his heart bitterly broken.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel prepares food with two servants at the open fireplace/oven. 
              Ichabod enters, rushed.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              No. She has gone out.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Where?</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.<br>
              (crossing to him)<br>
              You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Very little. I must be going...</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel holds out her cut palm, the gash sewn shut.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              Will you look at this? I cut my hand this morning: I sewed it myself, 
              but I am afraid it will go bad.</p>
            <p>Ichabod takes her hand, distracted and nervous.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              It appears well. It has already clotted.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              Look closer. Do you have anything to clean it with?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              It is fine. Now, I must...</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the wrist, tight.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              (whispering, close)<br>
              I know you saw me.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              What... ?<br>
              Lady Van Tassel glances to servants, keeps her voice low.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              I know you followed last night. You must promise not to tell Baltus...</p>
            <p>Ichabod tries to pull away, but she grips tighter. The FRONT DOOR 
              is HEARD SLAMMING. Ichabod is panicky.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              Have mercy on me. Please... have mercy.</p>
            <p>Ichabod pulls away just as Baltus enters. Lady Van Tassel goes 
              back to work as if nothing happened.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              Constable, it is urgent that we speak.</p>

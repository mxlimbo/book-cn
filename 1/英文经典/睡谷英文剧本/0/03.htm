            <p>EXT. BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>The torches burn bright. ABOVE, in the Belltower, Jonathan Masbath 
              loads a rifle. THUNDER BOOMS.</p>
            <p>Jonathan stands, looking to a sky that is all stars and moon. A 
              HORSE is HEARD SHRIEKING. Below, the horse tied at the base of the 
              tower is spooked.</p>
            <p>A COMMOTION is HEARD,, ground rumbling. Jonathan grips a rifle, 
              cocks it and moves to look...</p>
            <p>At the forest edge, a herd of deer stampedes out. They sprint past 
              the tower and across the field.</p>
            <p>Jonathan crosses to watch the herd scatter. He crosses back to 
              peer at the forest. Bad news...</p>
            <p>A thick FOG creeps from the woods.</p>
            <p>As the fog overtakes the base of each torch, a tentacle of mist 
              snakes up to the flame, killing it. All along the forest, arms of 
              vapor snuff torches... one by one by one...</p>
            <p>Above, Jonathan sights the rifle along the trees.</p>
            <p>JONATHAN<br>
              Come out, devil... come....</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod leans on a dresser. Katrina's still seated.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Not all think it is the Horseman. many say witches come from the 
              Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons. Some believe 
              a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death 
              as tribute. And, still others believe none of it.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Are you so superstitious?</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but 
              not all magic is black.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              There is no such thing as magic.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Really? Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming 
              proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              (laughs)<br>
              You are funny.</p>
            <p>Ichabod doesn't get what's so funny about that. The DISTANT TOLL 
              of a BELL is HEARD. Katrina looks fearful.</p>
            <p>She goes to open a window. The BELL TOLLS...</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. SLEEPY HOLLOW, OVERVIEW -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>... TOLLS mournfully over farms and forests...</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. FARM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>... TOLLS as a MAN comes from his barn, listening, then sprinting 
              towards his home.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>... TOLLS across the deserted square. Windows go dark. Shutters 
              are slammed shut.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>... TOLLS. Ichabod bounds out to the lawn, halting to listen. Katrina 
              and Baltus come out on the porch.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              Constable, where are you going!?</p>
            <p>... TOLLS... TOLLS... then, SILENCE. Ichabod chases away.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              Come back, sir... (watches him go)<br>
              Madness.</p>
            <p>Baltus ushers Katrina back in. The door slams.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod charges across the rocky field. He slows, awed...</p>
            <p>The Belltower is down, its mast is splintered. The horse is gone. 
              Ichabod moves to where the crow's nest lies smashed. No sign of 
              Jonathan.</p>
            <p>EXT. SLEEPY HOLLOW FOREST -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Jonathan runs past, gripping his bow. It's QUIET... till HOOFBEATS 
              are HEARD in pursuit.</p>
            <p>Trees are silhouetted against the sky. As HOOFBEATS get LOUDER, 
              branches bend like arms and fingers yearning to touch. As HOOFBEATS 
              ROAR PAST, the trees relax.</p>
            <p>FURTHER ON, Jonathan runs. WIND begins to BLOW.</p>
            <p>BEHIND, in motion, WE SEE Daredevil's snorting visage; eyes lizard-like, 
              with vertical slits literally aglow.</p>
            <p>The Horseman's hand yanks a wooden WAR HAMMER from a saddle mount. 
              (No clear view of the Horseman.)</p>
            <p>HORSEMAN'S P.O.V.: closing in on Jonathan.</p>
            <p>Jonathan is overtaken. The Horseman swings the hammer WHOOMP --sends 
              Jonathan sprawling.</p>
            <p>HOOFBEATS FADE. Jonathan tries to get up, but pain shoots through 
              him. He crawls to retrieve his bow.</p>
            <p>Against a tree, he takes an arrow from his shoulder quiver and 
              readies it. Waiting. A metal TAPPING is HEARD O.S. CLINK... CLINK... 
              CLINK. A HORSE SNORTS.</p>
            <p>Jonathan pulls the bow taut, pained, lips bloody.</p>
            <p>Elsewhere, Daredevil approaches slow. The Horseman taps his sword 
              on his spur, CLINK... CLINK... CLINK...</p>
            <p>Foliage moves as the Horseman's form pushes through.</p>
            <p>Jonathan releases -- the arrow WHISTLES...</p>
            <p>THWACK! -- imbeds in the Horseman's chest.</p>
            <p>CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... continues - Jonathan readies a second 
              arrow. Pulls and releases -- O.S. THWACK!</p>
            <p>CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Jonathan cries out, crawling away desperately. 
              Crawling through underbrush, over roots and rocks. CLINK... CLINK... 
              CLINK...<br>
              Jonathan gives up, spent, face to the dirt. He closes his eyes.</p>
            <p>CLINKING STOPS. Daredevil halts astride Jonathan; two legs on each 
              side of Jonathan's body.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. SLEEPY HOLLOW FARMLAND -- MORNING</p>
            <p>Baltus and a large, DULLARDLY MAN ride. Behind, Ichabod rides with 
              Magistrate Philipse.</p>
            <p>Ichabod is not adept at riding his old nag, Gunpowder.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife 
              and two infants. And the Widow Windsor was next...</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE<br>
              And now Jonathan Masbath.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (looks back, ponders)<br>
              Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross 
              before he reached cover?</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE<br>
              He would not have gone into the Western Woods. No sane man would.</p>
            <p>Philipse drinks from a whiskey flask, sees Ichabod watching and 
              offers some. Ichabod declines.</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE<br>
              Van Ripper there...</p>
            <p>Ahead, the dullard, VAN RIPPER, sloppily spits tobacco.</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE<br>
              ... found the body this morning. (pause)<br>
              You do believe now, don't you?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Believe?</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              You said yourself. What mere man could have downed the Belltower?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing 
              appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE<br>
              You need less big words, and more common sense.</p>
            <p>Philipse fingers an IRON KEY talisman he wears on a cord.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              What is that you wear?</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE<br>
              My talisman. It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave 
              face. But, I cannot run. If I run in fear, it is worthless.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Well... so much for common sense.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. SLEEPY HOLLOW FORESTS, FURT ER ON -- MORNING</p>
            <p>Brom and Baltus stand at a HORSE'S CORPSE amongst jagged boulders. 
              The flesh has been stripped, guts exposed. Philipse and Ichabod 
              arrive and dismount.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              Was this Jonathan's?</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              Yes. Seem she panicked across here and broke two legs.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Who took the meat?<br>
              BALTUS<br>
              Must have been the Redman. A Lenape Indian lives in the Western 
              Woods.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, 
              ghouls and Indians living there.</p>
            <p>Brom climbs up onto his own horse, a black beauty.</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              There's only one Lenape. He eats small animals and lost children... 
              and the occasional constable when he can get it.</p>
            <p>Brom rides. Ichabod goes to the dead horse, digs in his satchel 
              for a thin iron tool, which he uses it to pry off one HORSESHOE. 
              A WHISTLE is HEARD O.S.</p>
            <p>Everyone looks far ahead to where Van Ripper has ridden. The doctor 
              and others are there. Van Ripper waves.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. FOREST, MASBATH MURDER SITE -- MORNING</p>
            <p>Doctor Lancaster stands with SEVERAL ARMED MEN. A coffin on a cart 
              is covered by a blanket. Ichabod is crouched nearby.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Why did you move the body, Doctor?</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER<br>
              To place it inside its coffin.</p>
            <p>Ichabod, nods, vaguely annoyed. He puts the horseshoe into a hoofprint 
              in the dirt. It fits.</p>
            <p>Ichabod rises, walks, studying the ground, kicking up leaves. Brom, 
              Van Ripper, Baltus and Philipse watch.</p>
            <p>Ichabod finds a deep hoofprint. Huge. He compares the horseshoe. 
              The hoofprint is much larger.</p>
            <p>Ichabod pulls his satchel off his shoulder, takes out a bowl, bottle 
              of water and bag of brown powder; begins mixing. water and powder 
              with a fork to make plaster.</p>
            <p>The others watch, finding this bizarre, whispering. Brom comes 
              up to stand over Ichabod, irritated.</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              What the hell are you doing?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (ignoring pause)<br>
              You are the blacksmith. Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              Never. A shoe that size I would have remembered.</p>
            <p>Ichabod starts to fill the print with plaster.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Van Ripper. Can you show where the body lay?</p>
            <p><br>
              VAN RIPPER<br>
              I can show exactly.</p>
            <p>Van Ripper dismounts, wiping tobacco drool. Ichabod rises to follow 
              with his satchel.</p>
            <p>VAN RIPPER<br>
              Here... in front of this oak, facing north. Horrible...</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?</p>
            <p>Van Ripper points. Ichabod takes a BOTTLE of WHITE POWDER from 
              his pocket.</p>
            <p>He uncorks the bottle, cautiously pouring powder in an x on the 
              dirt there, then waiting.</p>
            <p>A chemical reaction causes the powder to bubble a bit.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              There was not much blood, was there?</p>
            <p>VAN RIPPER<br>
              I didn't see none.</p>
            <p>Ichabod stands, puzzled. He walks to the coffin cart, rolling up 
              his sleeves. Others come to watch, but keep their distance. Ichabod 
              removes the blanket...</p>
            <p>Reveals Jonathan's headless corpse.</p>
            <p>Philipse can't look. Ichabod takes strange spectacles from his 
              satchel; wire-framed with many lenses. MAGNIFICATION SPECTACLES. 
              He examines the gross neck wound, sniffs it.</p>
            <p>He pokes the flesh and severed spinal cord.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              No bleeding.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER<br>
              What is that?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched 
              flesh. How... ? Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....</p>
            <p>Ichabod straightens, eyes weirdly big in the spectacles.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              It instantly burnt the wound shut.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAY</p>
            <p>A coffin in a grave. Headstone reads MASBATH, 1799.&quot; A CROWD 
              gathered. Young Masbath broods. Clergyman Steenwyck steps forward 
              to take a handful of newly dug dirt.</p>
            <p>Men with guns stand at the outskirts, like on guard.</p>
            <p>Steenwyck sprinkles dirt into the grave with prayerful words. In 
              the crowd people whisper. They steal glances at Ichabod, who stands 
              with the Van Tassels.<br>
              INT. VAN-TASSEL HOUSE, DINING/VARIOUS ROOMS -- DAY</p>
            <p>Dining room. Sarah and two other servants collect plates. A few 
              people still sup, including Van Ripper, his warty WIFE and two kids. 
              Van Ripper guzzles ale, laughs at something his also-drunk wife 
              says.</p>
            <p>IN the HALL and FOYER, funeral goers socialize quietly. FURTHER 
              ON, in the SITTING ROOM, men smoke. Young Masbath is confronting 
              Ichabod, who is leaving...</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I am not here for revenge. I am here to bring justice.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Whatever. You still need a second to tend to your things.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I manage fine alone.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              I deserve to help you. Don't you see how much this means? My father... 
              he... he was a good man...</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (faces Masbath)<br>
              Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss. It is a great and sad tragedy. 
              However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              (angry)<br>
              I did not ask you to, did I?</p>
            <p>Young Masbath exits. Ichabod remains impassive.</p>

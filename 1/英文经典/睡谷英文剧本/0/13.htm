          <td>EXT. TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT
            <p>The coach comes to Lancaster's. Ichabod climbs out before it even 
              stops fully, satchel in hand. He hurries...</p>
            <p>INT. DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Doctor Lancaster, half asleep, comes to answer BANGING on his door. 
              Ichabod pushes past, taking Lancaster's lantern.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Pardon the intrusion...</p>
            <p>INT. DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod enters. There are two coffins on the floor.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I never examined these bodies.</p>
            <p>Ichabod removes the lid from one coffin. Lancaster is about to 
              say something indignant, but then just looks disgusted.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER<br>
              ... help yourself, you pompous ass.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              I will be in bed.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Would you stay, doctor? I may need assistance.</p>
            <p>Lancaster reluctantly remains. Ichabod stares at the dead Lady 
              Van Tassel. The neck wound is covered by a stained brown cloth, 
              which Ichabod unwraps.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Stains of blood.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER<br>
              What of it?</p>
            <p>Ichabod takes out one of the lenses that survived the magnification 
              spectacles, bends to examine the neck.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Jagged flesh.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              The Horseman did not do this.</p>
            <p>Ichabod moves to the side of the coffin, lifting the hand with 
              the stitched gash on its palm.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Here, Doctor. Hold this just so...</p>
            <p>Lancaster holds the lens so that Ichabod can study the cut through 
              it. Ichabod takes a scalpel-like knife from his satchel, lifts the 
              hand and cuts stitches.</p>
            <p>THROUGH THE LENS: the gash spreads easily, soft, bloodless.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              No clotting or gathering of pus. No healing at all.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER<br>
              What?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              When this cut was made, this person was already dead.<br>
              (stands straight)<br>
              This is not Lady Van Tassel.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Young Masbath enters. The door swings shut.<br>
              YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Katrina.<br>
              (steps forward)<br>
              Is anyone here?</p>
            <p>Behind him, the door SLAMS open -- Lady Van Tassel reaches to grab 
              Young Masbath by the throat.</p>
            <p>EXT. CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod charges up to the church doors, pounding.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Open the door. open up, damn it!<br>
              (pounds, shouting)<br>
              Lady van Tassel is alive. The Horseman is her puppet. Please...</p>
            <p>The door opens and Huge Farmer points a rifle at Ichabod. Frightened 
              people peer out from behind.</p>
            <p>HUGE FARMER<br>
              Aren't we rid of you?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Listen to me. Lady Van Tassel has faked her death. I need able men...</p>
            <p>HUGE FARMER<br>
              She's dead, and you have gone mad.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              No...</p>
            <p>HUGE FARMER<br>
              (steps forward)<br>
              Get out! Isn't it enough that you have ruined this town? Go!</p>
            <p>Ichabod backs away from the gun, frustrated, runs...</p>
            <p>At the DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, Van Ripper is still on the coach. Ichabod 
              sprints over, breathless, taking out his pistol.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Van Ripper... do you have a gun?</p>
            <p>VAN RIPPER<br>
              Yes. Here...</p>
            <p>Van Ripper hold up a rifle. Ichabod holds out his hand.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              May I see it?</p>
            <p>Van Ripper's confused, but hands the rifle over. Ichabod immediately 
              points his pistol at Van Ripper.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Get down. Hurry!</p>
            <p>Van Ripper climbs off. Ichabod climbs up, whips the horses.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD<br>
              Sorry.</p>
            <p>Van Ripper watches the coach leave, still with his hands up.</p>
            <p>EXT. FOREST -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>In a wooded area, Katrina lies unconscious. Gloved hands reach 
              to her hair and cut off a clump with SCISSORS.</p>
            <p>A conjuring pile has been made, containing a small animal's heart 
              with an iron nail through it. Katrina's hair is added and the pile 
              is lit to burn.</p>
            <p>Nearby, Young Masbath watches, on his belly with his hands tied 
              behind his back.</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel whispers over the fire, her white horse tied nearby. 
              She looks to Katrina, who stirs.</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel takes the Horseman's skull from a bag over her 
              shoulder, places the skull in the flames. THUNDER is HEARD. Lady 
              Van Tassel looks up, smiles.</p>
            <p>EXT. WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>The wind tosses leaves in swirls. The twisted tree opens wide. 
              with a RUMBLE -- shafts of light shooting out.</p>
            <p>EXT. THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod drives the coach hard ahead.</p>
            <p>EXT. FOREST -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Katrina sits up, groggy. Lady Van Tassel looks down at her.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              You... you are alive.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              Am I? Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?</p>
            <p>Katrina sees Young Masbath, and beyond him, the dying fire.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              She commands the Horseman.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              And, quite beautifully done, wouldn't you say? It is almost over.</p>
            <p>THUNDER again. Wind starts to pick up.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              (of the wind)<br>
              He rides tonight.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Father saw you die.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled. 
              Things I wanted him to see. But, as long as I govern the Horseman, 
              he cannot harm me. Baltus did not stay enough to see that. He ran 
              as a coward, unfettered by my fate.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Then, whose body was it... ?</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              The precious servant girl Sarah. I killed her and kept her body 
              hidden, till I needed it. And, when I return to the Hollow tomorrow, 
              my version of the truth will come to pass.<br>
              (faking meekness)<br>
              I mean, there I was that fateful day, following Baltus into the 
              woods. I did not know what he was up to... where he was going. I 
              worried for his safety.</p>
            <p>Katrina cautiously moves the hand she's supporting herself with, 
              feels a rock and clutches it.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant. 
              A girl who had apparently become his secret love.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              No one will believe your lies, whore.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon. But... I 
              am not going to kill you. Not me...</p>
            <p>She picks up the Horseman's skull in her gloved hand.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              He will have that honor.</p>
            <p>EXT. WESTERN WOODS -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>The Horseman rides Daredevil, a freight train of moldering flesh, 
              heading towards a chasm with no bridge.</p>
            <p>They reach it, galloping in mid-air to the other side.</p>
            <p>EXT. LONG STRAIGHT ROAD/VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod guides the coach into the Van Tassel orchard.</p>
            <p>EXT. FOREST -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel admires the skull.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              (mock sorrow)<br>
              Woe is me.. that spying on my husband in his filthy indiscretion, 
              I saw he and Sarah attacked by the Horseman. Oh pity me... so overcome 
              was I that I wandered in the Western Woods... dazed... nearly blind 
              from terror.</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel crouches, rubbing dirt on her face.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              And, tomorrow is my grand performance, having barely survived the 
              elements...<br>
              (more emoting)<br>
              By sheer luck I found my way back to the Hollow. But... what do 
              I find here... ? My dear, sweet step-daughter Katrina is dead. why 
              has God forsaken her?</p>
            <p>Seeing that Lady Van Tassel lavish attention on Katrina, Masbath 
              takes this opportunity to ease onto his knees.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              (of herself, pleased)<br>
              No one will suspect this sad woman who has been through such an 
              ordeal. With only the empty solace of her money and land to comfort 
              her.</p>
            <p>EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod leaps from the coach, bounds up the porch.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Katrina!</p>
            <p>EXT. FOREST -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>ICHABOD is HEARD. Lady Van Tassel turns, astonished.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Murderer!</p>
            <p>Katrina slings the rock -- strikes Lady Van Tassel in the head, 
              a glancing blow that knocks her down. Katrina runs.</p>
            <p>Katrina grips Young Masbath, helping him up...</p>
            <p>But, Lady Van Tassel scrambles up, grabs Katrina and throws her 
              back to the ground.</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel steps hard on Katrina's ankle, touches her forehead, 
              bleeding, pissed.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              You've been a naughty girl.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath leaps to action, charging head first -- slams into 
              Lady Van Tassel, sends her backwards.</p>
            <p>Katrina runs and pulls Masbath up. They flee.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Ichabod!</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel rolls, recovering, not very concerned.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              Little bitch.</p>
            <p>EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod comes out the open front doors... hearing...</p>
            <p>KATRINA (O.S.)<br>
              (far away)<br>
              Ichabod!</p>
            <p>Ichabod climbs back on the coach, taking off.</p>
            <p>EXT. FOREST -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Katrina and Young Masbath run out from a line of trees.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Ichabod!</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Here we are!</p>
            <p>BEHIND IN THE FOREST, Lady Van Tassel rides her white horse, in 
              no hurry. Wind kicks hard. HOOFBEATS are HEARD.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              Run, Katrina! Fast as your pretty legs will carry you. It makes 
              no difference.</p>
            <p>ON THE LAWN, Ichabod drives towards Katrina and Masbath.</p>
            <p>Behind, at the tree line, Lady Van Tassel holds up the Horseman's 
              skull, wind tossing her dress and hair.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              Nothing will stop him now!</p>
            <p>At mid-field, Ichabod reaches Katrina and Masbath.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Climb up!</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Lady Van Tassel...</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I know. Hold on.</p>
            <p>With Katrina and Masbath on board, Ichabod turns the coach. Katrina 
              unties Masbath's hands. HOOFBEATS GET LOUDER.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              Olly-olly oxen-free!</p>
            <p>Ichabod looks back towards Lady Van Tassel.</p>
            <p>At the treeline, the Horseman breaks into the open, hell on horseback. 
              Full speed ahead.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Christ.</p>

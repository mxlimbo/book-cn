            <p>Being the true storie of one Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman</p>
            <p>Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker</p>
            <p>Based on &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; by Washington 
              Irving</p>
            <p>Screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>A pleasing land of drowsy head it was, of dreams that wave before 
              the half shut eye...</p>
            <p><br>
              <br>
              EXT. GNARLED FOREST--NIGHT</p>
            <p>An UGLY MAN charges through on a horse, holding a lantern forward 
              on a long pole. He looks back, terrified</p>
            <p>INSERT TITLE: 1799 Sleepy Hollow, New York</p>
            <p>THUNDEROUS HOOFBEATS are HEARD behind.</p>
            <p>The ugly man glances back again. His lantern swings wild...</p>
            <p>SHATTERS against a tree. The jammed-up pole SLAMS the ugly man 
              off his horse...</p>
            <p>He hits the ground. He runs, trips, falls and scrambles up.</p>
            <p>DEEP IN THE FOREST, we glimpse the source of the HOOFBEATS: a HUGE 
              FORM on a HUGE BLACK HORSE, already gone</p>
            <p>The ugly man pushes through thorny bushes. Jagged branches slit 
              his hands and cheeks.</p>
            <p>He bursts from the briar patch and tumbles to a trail . He lifts 
              his bloodied face. He runs.</p>
            <p>IN THE FOREST BEHIND: the hooves of the black horse rip underbrush. 
              HOOFBEATS DEAFENING. A spur digs into the snorting steed's already 
              bleeding flank.</p>
            <p>The pursuer's gloved hand draws a SWORD, blade RINGING.</p>
            <p>ON THE TRAIL, the ugly man runs on. The shrill WHISTLE of a SWORD 
              SWING is HEARD as the pursuer blurs past.</p>
            <p>The ugly man is still running when his head lolls back, at an impossible 
              angle...tumbles off his shoulders... His headless body hits the 
              dirt.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. CITY STREETS-- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Empty cobblestone streets. Crooked buildings. A RAPIDLY CLANGING 
              BELL breaks the silence from afar.</p>
            <p>INSERT TITLE: New York City</p>
            <p>TWO CONSTABLES clamor round a corner, lanterns held high, listening. 
              They rush into an alleyway.</p>
            <p>ELSEWHERE, piers border the Hudson River. The BELL is LOUDER. The 
              two constables arrive, searching. No one around. Constable One hefts 
              his pistol, scared.</p>
            <p>CONSTABLE ONE<br>
              Where are you?!</p>
            <p>MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)<br>
              Here! Over here!</p>
            <p>They hurry to the river's edge. Down a hill, the MAN, another constable, 
              stands with his back to us. He's waist deep in water, tossing away 
              his ALARM BELL.</p>
            <p>MAN<br>
              I need your help with this.</p>
            <p>Constable Two crosses on the pier above. Constable One moves forward, 
              wary. The MAN grunts, lifting something.</p>
            <p>CONSTABLE ONE<br>
              Constable Crane? Ichabod Crane...is that you?</p>
            <p>The MAN turns. Meet ICHABOD CRANE, handsome, eyes piercing.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Yes, it is me. But, not only me... (lifting, struggling)<br>
              I found someone here...</p>
            <p>He drags a bloated MALE CORPSE up from the murky water</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Someone quite dead.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. WATCHHOUSE/JAIL --NIGHT</p>
            <p>The elderly HIGH CONSTABLE lifts a blanket off the corpse on a 
              wheelbarrow manned by Constable Two. A snobby MAGISTRATE looks, 
              disgusted. Constable One and Ichabod wait.</p>
            <p>HIGH CONSTABLE<br>
              Burn it.</p>
            <p>CONSTABLE ONE<br>
              Yes, sir.</p>
            <p>Constable Two wheels the corpse inside. Ichabod's dismayed</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Just a moment...if I may. It is possible this man was murdered.</p>
            <p>HIGH CONSTABLE<br>
              He drowned. Anyone could see.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in 
              his lungs...</p>
            <p>Ichabod follows the High Constable and Magistrate in.<br>
              INT. WATCHHOUSE, NIGHT WATCH QUARTERS --NIGHT</p>
            <p>Constable Two wheels the body ahead past many &quot;booking&quot; 
              tables. A JAILER moves to unlock a massive door.</p>
            <p>HIGH CONSTABLE<br>
              He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I could determine if he were dead before he went into the Hudson</p>
            <p>HIGH CONSTABLE<br>
              Must we again hear these heretical rantings?</p>
            <p>MAGISTRATE<br>
              Yes, must we?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              There is nothing heretical about science, sir. The Chinese have 
              written on it for hundreds of years...procedural study used to solve 
              seemingly unsolvable crimes.</p>
            <p>The door is opened. The corpse again leads the way.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. WATCHHOUSE, JAIL --NIGHT</p>
            <p>A two-tiered prison, alive with MOANS of AGONY and CRIES of INSANITY. 
              Cells are full of wretched men in chains and iron gags. Many are 
              against the bars, watching.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, 
              but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, 
              then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.</p>
            <p>HIGH CONSTABLE<br>
              Have they nothing to fear presently?</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Without disrespect, look around you.<br>
              (motioning to cells)<br>
              We overflow. As do our courts.</p>
            <p><br>
              HIGH CONSTABLE<br>
              And, with disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it 
              is testimony to success, not failure.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried 
              without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?</p>
            <p>The High Constable reaches a desk, taking a seat. Guards wait to 
              process beaten, bloody prisoners.</p>
            <p>HIGH CONSTABLE<br>
              Very few, if any.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, 
              often quite literally?</p>
            <p>HIGH CONSTABLE<br>
              For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican 
              liberalism.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Not Liberalism. Equanimity.</p>
            <p>MAGISTRATE (to High Constable)<br>
              Um, sir...might I suggest...</p>
            <p>The Magistrate WHISPERS in the High Constable's ear. Ichabod notices 
              with worry that Constables One and Two wheel the corpse onwards 
              into another room.</p>
            <p>The Magistrate finishes. The High Constable smiles faintly</p>
            <p>HIGH CONSTABLE (to Ichabod)<br>
              There is a farming community upstate, Constable... two days journey 
              north in the Hudson Highlands. It is named Sleepy Hollow. Within 
              a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their 
              head lopped cleanly off.</p>
            <p>(holds up papers)<br>
              The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting 
              assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Chosen me?</p>
            <p>HIGH CONSTABLE<br>
              These &quot;methods&quot; of yours...there has been no practical 
              application.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Not for lack of trying.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>BURGOMASTER<br>
              Just so. Granted. And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy 
              Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place. Bring him 
              here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD (swallowing doubt)<br>
              I shall, gladly</p>
            <p>HIGH CONSTABLE<br>
              Excellent. Then, you are excused till morning</p>
            <p>Ichabod moves away, heading to where the corpse was taken.</p>
            <p>HIGH CONSTABLE<br>
              Oh, and, Constable...(off Ichabod's look) Do make certain that you 
              meet with success. Otherwise... perhaps you should not come back 
              at all.</p>
            <p>The High Constable smiles a sardonic smile</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. WATCHHOUSE, INCINERATION ROOM --NIGHT</p>
            <p>The corpse burns in a raging furnace. Flesh sizzles</p>
            <p>Constable One pumps bellows, which fan the flames. Ichabod steps 
              from darkness nearby. He watches with bitter regret as the corpse 
              is consumed.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. CITY --DAY</p>
            <p>Market town streets bustle. Filthy. Pigs roam free.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ICHABOD'S HOME, SECOND FLOOR --DAY</p>
            <p>Decorated in Early-American Mad Scientist: books, papers and jars 
              of chemicals. Charts of anatomy above a small bed.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD (O.S.)<br>
              Such a day for such a sad farewell. But, this is goodbye, my sweet.</p>
            <p>At the window, Ichabod holds a bird cage with a red CARDINAL inside. 
              He opens the cage. The bird flies free.</p>
            <p>Ichabod watches it go, then looks down. A COACH halts in the street 
              below. The forlorn DRIVER looks up.</p>
            <p>INT. ICHABOD'S COACH --DAY</p>
            <p>In motion. Ichabod absently studies his hands, touching the strange 
              SCARS on both palms: evenly dispersed, tiny dots of tissue. Many 
              scars.</p>
            <p>Ichabod lifts a LEATHER SATCHEL, checking its contents</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. UPSTATE FORESTS --DAY</p>
            <p>TWO FAMILIES of MIGRANT WORKERS travel a path, leading over-burdened 
              horses. Ichabod's coach approaches from the other direction. Ichabod 
              looks out, unnerved.</p>
            <p>One GAUNT MAN watches Ichabod pass. There is a dead, worried look 
              in the man's eyes. Others stare at Ichabod.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. SLEEPY HOLLOW, THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD --DAY</p>
            <p>Ichabod faces two massive, vine-covered PILLARS, unsure. He turns 
              to watch the driver lead the coach away.</p>
            <p>Ichabod walks between the pillars to a long straight road. He does 
              not notice, above: THREE DEAD RAVENS hang from a tree limb, twine 
              wrapped round their necks.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. SLEEPY HOLLOW, TOWN SQUARE --DAY</p>
            <p>Ichabod walks on with baggage. The square is empty, a CHURCH and 
              GRAVEYARD at one end. The road ahead is bordered by businesses and 
              homes.</p>
            <p>CONVERSATION DRIFTS from a tavern. A criminal sits in stocks. A 
              quiet CRYING is HEARD. Ichabod hears...</p>
            <p>He looks for its source. It's from a window eave, LOUDER. SOUNDS 
              like the SOBBING of an OLD WOMAN.</p>

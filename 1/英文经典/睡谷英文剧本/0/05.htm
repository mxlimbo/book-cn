            <p>EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>A light glows in Ichabod's window. LOOKING IN: Ichabod's in bed, 
              fully dressed. He sits up. Pause. He crosses to pick up &quot;Romeo 
              and Juliet.&quot; He begins to read.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. PHILIPSE'S FARM -- DUSK</p>
            <p>Ichabod walks with Philipse. Young Masbath follows with the horses. 
              CICADAS CHATTER from a vast corn field.</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE<br>
              Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse. 
              For stealing a horse! And, you dig up our dead.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed 
              on from Clergyman Steenwyck?</p>
            <p>The CICADAS SUDDENLY go SILENT. Young Masbath notices.</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE<br>
              We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables. 
              Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I know it.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Um.... excuse me, sirs...</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE<br>
              (still to Ichabod)<br>
              Because of the Horseman, our migrant workers flee for their lives. 
              There is a danger that our crops will rot. So, if you are going 
              to help us, you stop the Horseman. That is your task... to kill 
              an undead thing.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath looks to a fenced grazing area, worried. The sheep 
              there are agitated, all running one direction away.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Listen to what you say....</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE<br>
              No, you listen! You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              At times I do.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Sirs... please!</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE<br>
              What will it take for you to realize this is no laughing matter?</p>
            <p>The horses go crazy, braying and rearing. The reins yank Young 
              Masbath off his feet as the horses flee.</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Philipse look to Masbath. A SOUND is HEARD, distant: 
              THUNDERING HOOFBEATS. Wind kicks up. HOOFBEATS seem to come FROM 
              ALL DIRECTIONS.</p>
            <p>Philipse looks to the corn field. A flock of birds alights; a great 
              sheet of black against the sky.</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE<br>
              Oh my... oh my oh my oh my...</p>
            <p>Philipse runs towards his house, past Masbath. HOOFBEATS are LOUDER, 
              CLOSER. Ichabod faces the corn field.</p>
            <p>The field explodes open, stalks bending to make way as the Headless 
              Horseman gallops into view atop Daredevil.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath runs, following Philipse.</p>
            <p>Ichabod's stunned. He looks down to draw his flintlock pistol, 
              but the Horseman blows by before he can raise it. A blast of air 
              knocks Ichabod off his feet.</p>
            <p>The Horseman chases Masbath and Philipse.</p>
            <p>Ichabod follows.</p>
            <p>The Horseman draws his sword.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath falls in the grass...</p>
            <p>Daredevil's pounding hooves will certainly crush him.</p>
            <p>Daredevil leaps over Young Masbath, continuing the charge.</p>
            <p>Philipse has a long way to go before home. He looks over his shoulder. 
              No way he'll make it.</p>
            <p>Ichabod, running, watches Philipse slow.</p>
            <p>Philipse gathers all his courage and stops, turning. The Horseman 
              is closing, sword held high.</p>
            <p>Philipse raises his talisman.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Philipse!</p>
            <p>Philipse holds the talisman up, trying to be fearless. The Horseman 
              swings -- WE HEAR the CLANK of sword on talisman...</p>
            <p>Philipse's severed head spins. His body falls and folds.</p>
            <p>Ichabod runs past Young Masbath.</p>
            <p>The Horseman halts just as Ichabod reaches a point in front of 
              dead Philipse, aiming his pistol. Daredevil lets out a SCREECHY 
              CRY. The Horseman rides toward Ichabod.</p>
            <p>Ichabod gets on one knee, trying to steady his pistol. The Horseman 
              closes. Ichabod sweats bullets. FIRES...</p>
            <p>The slug SLAMS the Horseman dead center -- bursts through and rends 
              his uniform without slowing him.</p>
            <p>The Horseman is almost on Ichabod. Ichabod cringes, arms up... 
              as the Horseman passes.</p>
            <p>The Horseman leans to skewer Philipse's head with his sword.</p>
            <p>With the head as his prize, the Horseman races away.</p>
            <p>Ichabod gets up, watches the Horseman head to the forest. Ichabod 
              looks to Young Masbath, finds his legs will not support him, falls, 
              trembling. THUNDER BELLOWS.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel comes to a door, knocks. Sarah stands behind with 
              a tray of food. Young Masbath is seated near.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              (to Young Masbath)<br>
              Has he not come out at all?</p>
            <p>Young Masbath shakes his head.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>KNOCKING is HEARD. Ichabod sleeps restlessly.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>THUNDER BOOMS. WIND and POUNDING RAIN blast open a window. Mother 
              comes to it, then moves to comfort fearful Young Ichabod in bed.</p>
            <p>MOTHER'S VOICE (v.o.)<br>
              Don't be afraid... don't be afraid.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY</p>
            <p>A keyhole. Young Ichabod's eye peers in...</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- P.O.V, THROUGH KEYHOLE</p>
            <p>Mother is kneeled before flour on the floor. She draws patterns 
              in it, whispering. She blows the flour away.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY</p>
            <p>The Freakish Woman (who argued with Mother) walks towards the home, 
              supported by a SAD MAN. She weeps, carrying something in a blanket.</p>
            <p>Young Ichabod comes a window, watching, scared.</p>
            <p>The Freakish Woman is so weak that she falls. The blanket opens... 
              the corpse of an infant tumbles to the dirt. The Freakish Woman's 
              WAILING GROWS LOUDER.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FRONT OF YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>TWO MEN in black drag Mother to a coach. She looks back, fearful, 
              pulled along. A THIRD MAN in black follows.</p>
            <p>Young Ichabod struggles as Father restrains him.</p>
            <p>YOUNG ICHABOD<br>
              No... mother... no... !</p>
            <p>The Third Man peers back, a gray-haired, Cotton Mather-ish man 
              with a villainous face.<br>
              FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)<br>
              The night of the great storm, I saw her cross my windows.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY</p>
            <p>Many people in the gallery. The Third Man stands in front of the 
              tearful Freakish Woman in the witness box.</p>
            <p>THIRD MAN<br>
              You are certain it was she?</p>
            <p>FREAKISH WOMAN<br>
              In the lighting, I did see her. (points)<br>
              Her. Lady Crane...</p>
            <p>Mother sits in shackles.</p>
            <p>FREAKISH WOMAN<br>
              I will never forget. The next moment, I found my infant dead... 
              with the blood welt on his breast.</p>
            <p>Those in attendance cry out at this. Ichabod is seated beside Father, 
              eyes filled with tears.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>As before, a STORM RAGES. Ichabod is in Mother's arms.</p>
            <p>FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)<br>
              The night of the great storm, I saw her cross my windows.</p>
            <p>MOTHER<br>
              Don't be afraid...</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- DAY</p>
            <p>KNOCKING is HEARD. Ichabod gasps awake.</p>
            <p>KATRINA (O.S.)<br>
              Constable Crane?</p>
            <p>Ichabod looks at his hands balled into fists. He opens them --has 
              ONE HALF of PHILIPSE'S TALISMAN in each palm.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Katrina holds a tray of food. The DOOR is HEARD UNLOCKING.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Katrina enters. Ichabod sits at his work table.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Are you hungry?<br>
              Ichabod shakes his head, won't look up. Katrina crosses.</p>
            <p>She begins picking up pieces of the PLASTER HOOFPRINT CAST which 
              lies shattered on the floor.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              You promised justice.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              People have put their trust in you.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              They have done nothing of the sort.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Won't they still have that justice? (patience waning)<br>
              or, was it a vain promise?</p>
            <p>Ichabod stews, head in his hands. Someone is HEARD RUNNING... Young 
              Masbath enters, frightened.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Constable Crane... something has happened.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. WESTERN WOODS -- DAY</p>
            <p>The Lenape Indian hangs dead in a tree, lynched. TOWNSFOLK are 
              gathered. Ichabod makes his way through, followed by Young Masbath, 
              looking up.</p>
            <p>BROM (o.s.)<br>
              We do not need you, Constable...</p>
            <p>BROM strides towards Ichabod from a group of men spreading a sheet 
              under the tree. Van Ripper's there.</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              The men who did this have been taken. We do not need you here.</p>
            <p>Brom points to where TWO FILTHY MEN in chains sit in a horse-drawn 
              cart. An armed man guards them.</p>
            <p>ONE FILTHY MAN<br>
              You should thank us. The killings will end. We saved you all!</p>
            <p>The armed man shoves the filthy man to shut him up.</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              They spend two days in chains.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Two days... ? For murder?</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              For poaching. Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate 
              Philipse has given up the ghost?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Does that look like an animal hanging?<br>
              BROM<br>
              Looks like an Indian.</p>
            <p>Van Ripper cuts the noose rope at the trunk. The Lenape corpse 
              free falls, landing hard.</p>
            <p>The Lenape lies in a heap on the sheet. Van Ripper and others come 
              to lift the sheet with the Lenape in the middle. Ichabod watches, 
              noticing...</p>
            <p>The Lenape wears a WOVEN PIECE of REED GRASS a cord on his loin 
              cloth, twisted in a pattern.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Wait. Give me a moment...</p>
            <p>Ichabod kneels. He removes the woven piece, looking across the 
              diseased Lenape's body. Something else...</p>
            <p>The Lenape's mouth is agape; teeth rotting. Ichabod looks around, 
              finds a twig. He uses it to pull the Lenape's mouth open... gets 
              close to peer inside the Lenape's mouth.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY</p>
            <p>A DRAWING of the Lenape's WOVEN PIECE in Ichabod's ledger. The 
              piece lies near.</p>
            <p>Ichabod sits staring at it, trance-like. Masbath waits. Long silence.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              How could he?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              His teeth. Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far 
              back in his mouth. The Lenape could not have done that for himself. 
              (closes his journal)<br>
              Someone out there cared for him.</p>
            <p>Ichabod rises, deciding. He picks up his satchel and exits. Young 
              Masbath is surprised. He follows.</p>

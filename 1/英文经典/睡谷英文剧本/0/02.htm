            <p>EXT. VAN TASSEL ESTATE --DAY</p>
            <p>ICHABOD'S P.O.V.: a BELLTOWER stands tall, like a mast pole with 
              a crow's nest basket atop. There's a man in the basket and a huge 
              BELL.</p>
            <p>Ichabod ponders this as he continues. Ahead on a hill: the grand 
              Van Tassel Manor House.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL MANOR HOUSE, SITTING ROOM --DAY</p>
            <p>MANY CHILDREN, in a circle, taunt a BLINDFOLDED YOUNG WOMAN spun 
              round by the handsome, barrel-chested man, BROM VAN BRUNT. A few 
              YOUNG MEN and LADIES watch. Brom releases the woman. Everyone quiets 
              and avoids her searching hands.</p>
            <p>BLINDFOLDED WOMAN<br>
              This is such a silly game.</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              Be a sport and stop complaining.</p>
            <p>The woman moves to Brom's voice. He backs away, flanked by peers 
              GLENN and THEODORE. Children laugh.</p>
            <p>Ichabod enters, clearing his throat. No one notices. The blindfolded 
              woman keeps grasping. One LITTLE GIRL sees Ichabod and goes to him, 
              finger to her lips.</p>
            <p>LITTLE GIRL<br>
              Play along. You must.</p>
            <p>She tugs him. Before Ichabod can protest, he is placed in the blindfolded 
              woman's grip.</p>
            <p>BLINDFOLDED WOMAN<br>
              There, I have someone. Am I finished?</p>
            <p>LITTLE GIRL<br>
              You have to tell who it is.</p>
            <p>The woman touches Ichabod's face. He is uncomfortable, affected 
              by this caress. Brom watches jealously.</p>
            <p>LITTLE GIRL<br>
              At least make a guess.</p>
            <p>BLINDFOLDED WOMAN<br>
              I don't know. Is it Brom Bones?</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              Certainly not.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Excuse me, Miss... (takes her hands)<br>
              They have a laugh at your expense.<br>
              She takes the kerchief off to reveal a stunning beauty: KATRINA 
              VAN TASSEL. Ichabod tries to compose himself.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Forgive me, I didn't know.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              We haven;t heard your name yet, friend.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.<br>
              Brom grabs Ichabod's collar, pissed. Ichabod's baffled.</p>
            <p>BROM<br>
              You need some manners.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Brom!</p>
            <p>Brom looks at her, then reluctantly releases Ichabod.</p>
            <p>MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)<br>
              What is this, then... ?</p>
            <p>BALTUS VAN TASSEL, 45, has entered, a working-class aristocrat. 
              LADY VAN TASSEL, 40, stands behind, a mix of home-spun wife and 
              well-kept lady.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              Can I help you, sir?</p>
            <p>Ichabod's relieved to have a proper focal point. Children gather 
              around Katrina and hide behind her.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I have been sent from the city with a letter of introduction. I 
              am told you offer me room and board.</p>
            <p>Ichabod hands over papers. Baltus reads, furrows his brow.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              If we could speak alone.</p>
            <p>BALTUS (nods, looks to Katrina)<br>
              This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it? Am I mistaken?</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              They're only children, father.</p>
            <p>Baltus snorts, then exits with Ichabod. The others huddle to gossip, 
              except Katrina, who moves beside Lady Van Tassel to watch Ichabod 
              and Baltus walk down the hall.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR -- DAY</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER, 50, dour and always sweaty, takes a seat by the 
              fire, joining Baltus and three other elders. A pretty servant, SARAH, 
              brings a pipe cradle while Lady Van Tassel sets down food. Ichabod 
              is standing.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              That will be all, ladies.<br>
              (waits as they exit)<br>
              We are joined by Doctor Thomas Lancaster, Constable. And to his 
              left are, Clergyman Steenwyck and our able magistrate, Samuel Philipse, 
              both keeping order in their own ways.</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE is youngest, eyes bloodshot, mug in hand and pipe in mouth. 
              CLERGYMAN STEENWYCK is formidably built, wearing a constant look 
              of disapproval.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              I myself am in charge of financial matters and the regulation of 
              currency in our commonwealth. And, lastly, this fine fellow is James 
              Hardenbrook, our Notary.</p>
            <p>HARDENBROOK is oldest, ancient, with one eye pale and blind.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              An honor, gentlemen. In time I will need every detail of the three 
              murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any 
              theory at all as to who the killer might be?</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER<br>
              Excuse me?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER<br>
              I was afraid of this.</p>
            <p>Philipse shoots a look to Baltus. Angst amongst the elders.</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE<br>
              Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what 
              we expected. We sent for the militia.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              The militia?</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm? How much have your superiors 
              bothered to tell you?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their 
              bodies...</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.</p>
            <p>Withered Hardenbrook leans forward, his voice cragged.</p>
            <p>HARDENBROOK<br>
              Taken. Taken by the Headless Horseman. Taken back to hell.<br>
              ICHABOD<br>
              Pardon me?</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              You have not been well informed of our troubles, sir. If you would...</p>
            <p>Baltus gestures for Ichabod to sit. Baltus lights his pipe.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              The Horseman... he was a Hessian mercenary, sent to our shores by 
              German princes to help keep Americans under the thumb of England. 
              However, unlike his compatriots who came as muscle in trade for 
              currency, he came willingly; for love of carnage.</p>
            <p><br>
              FLASHBACK -- AMERICAN BATTLEFIELD -- DAY</p>
            <p>The HESSIAN HORSEMAN rides his black steed into a gory, close-quarters 
              clash, his cloaked uniform adorned with edged weapons. He cuts down 
              Americans left and right.</p>
            <p>BALTUS (v.o.)<br>
              He was infamous for taking his horse, Daredevil, hard into battle... 
              chopping off heads at full gallop.</p>
            <p>He dismounts, hoisting a battle axe. With sword and axe, he annihilates. 
              Blood gushes. Bones crack.</p>
            <p>BALTUS (V. 0.)<br>
              Just to look on him made your blood run cold, for he had filed down 
              his teeth to rapiers... to add to the ferocity of his appearance.</p>
            <p>The Horseman lets out a war cry. Jagged teeth. Grotesque.</p>
            <p><br>
              FOREST BATTLEFIELD -- DAY</p>
            <p>Winter. CANNONS can be HEARD BOOKING from afar. Daredevil lies 
              dead in red snow. FOLLOW FOOTPRINTS away...</p>
            <p>BALTUS (v.o.)<br>
              He would not finally meet his end till the winter of seventy-nine, 
              when New York City was held by Henry Clinton and Washington occupied 
              West Point. It was between those two places, not far from here...</p>
            <p>The Horseman flees, cloak flowing, chased by FIVE rag-tag REVOLUTIONARY 
              SOLDIERS. Ahead, a steep, rocky area prevents escape. Soldier one 
              aims a rifle and FIRES...</p>
            <p>Blood explodes from the Horseman's arm as he runs. His sword falls 
              from his now functionless hand.</p>
            <p>Soldier Two grabs the sword.</p>
            <p>At the rocks, the Horseman faces the men. Another Rifleman raises 
              his rifle. The Horseman reaches over his shoulder to grasp a sheathed 
              knife, THROWS -</p>
            <p>THOCK! The Rifleman jerks back, knife in his eye socket.</p>
            <p>The Horseman readies an axe. The Revolutionaries move in with swords. 
              They battle, STEEL AGAINST STEEL. The Horseman fends off blows from 
              all sides.</p>
            <p>Soldier Three lunges, stabs his blade deep into the Horseman's 
              side. The Horseman roars, brings his axe DOWN... BREAKS the sword 
              at the hilt...</p>
            <p>An UPWARDS stroke sends Soldier Three head over heels in a fountain 
              of blood.</p>
            <p>The Horseman staggers, howling, trying to pull the blade from his 
              ribs. The remaining soldiers close in.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Pipe smoke wafts from Philipse's mouth.</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE<br>
              Cut off his head with his own sword. It's a legend told for twenty 
              years.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              But, only recently has the Headless Hessian been seen prowling the 
              Hollow, in search of a head to suit his shoulders.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Just a moment... (sits back, incredulous)<br>
              Are you saying it is he?</p>
            <p>HARDENBROOK<br>
              (aggravated, loud)<br>
              When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow Poltergeists 
              of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!</p>
            <p>Hardenbrook BANGS his cane on a table. Baltus puts a calming hand 
              on senile Hardenbrook's shoulder.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER<br>
              No one knows why he chose to now to climb out from his grave.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              It is very clear why. Citizens here have long tried to hide sins 
              behind closed doors. Their failed faith has saturated the soil and 
              called forth one of Satan's own.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              Many have.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.</p>
            <p>A long wait. No reply from the elders. Ichabod rises.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              While I will do everything I can to find your assassin, I will look 
              for a man of flesh and blood. Not some goblin-demon from hell.</p>
            <p>EXT. BELLTOWER FIELD -- EARLY EVENING</p>
            <p>The Belltower is covered in defensive spikes. A man climbs down 
              a rope ladder. Below, many ARMED MEN gather. Everyone grim. Philipse 
              moves to the center, on horseback.</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE<br>
              Gather round! Gather and quiet! The hour has come to choose for 
              this night. Each man's name is in this box and has been checked.</p>
            <p>A box is handed up. Ichabod and Baltus arrive on foot at the back 
              of the mob. Ichabod looks...</p>
            <p>At a nearby forest, men light TORCH POSTS in a line bordering the 
              forest edge for at least a half mile.</p>
            <p>Philipse draws a folded paper from the box, holds it up.</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE<br>
              May the Lord watch over him... (unfolds paper)<br>
              &quot;Jonathan Masbath.&quot; Are you here?</p>
            <p>JONATHAN (o.s.)<br>
              I am. I take my responsibility.</p>
            <p>The crowd parts as JONATHAN MASBATH, a dirt-poor farmer with a 
              bow and quiver of arrows, moves forward. His son, YOUNG MASBATH 
              14, grips his arm.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              No, father. Wait... (up to Philipse)<br>
              He's already been up once. Why does he go again?</p>
            <p>JONATHAN<br>
              It is a lottery, son. It just as easily might have been one of them.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Then... I go with you.</p>
            <p>JONATHAN<br>
              No. You obey my wishes. (looks to crowd)<br>
              Brom. Look after him, will you?</p>
            <p>Brom steps up, nodding. Jonathan kisses his son's cheek, then heads 
              to the rope ladder. Men pat him on the back.</p>
            <p>PHILIPSE<br>
              Someone leave him a horse.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath watches his father go. Brom coaxes him away. At the 
              back of the crowd, Ichabod watches skeptically, looks to Young Masbath 
              as he and Brom pass.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              You worry for naught, little man. Nothing will harm him there. (looks 
              up, sotto)<br>
              It is problems here on the ground you people need begin to worry 
              about.</p>
            <p>Ichabod watches Jonathan climb, very high above.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod makes notations in a LEDGER BOOK.<br>
              KATRINA (v.o.)<br>
              You will dream.</p>
            <p>Katrina strolls in, sits on the bed. Ichabod is nervous.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Did they tell? It is something in the air so that dreams come to 
              everyone. According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows 
              here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger 
              to this day.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Feel free to form your own opinion. (facing his ledger)<br>
              Though it appears you already have.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom 
              Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse. (getting up to

              I'll leave you to your business.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Excuse me... I should apologize. I, um... I.. have no great love 
              of...</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Other people?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Small talk.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              It might have been more. Might have been positively grand talk.</p>
            <p>Ichabod offers his chair, backing away. Seeing it is the only one, 
              he remains standing. Katrina sits.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              it me, or are you this nervous around all women?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly 
              wrapped around my throat.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              My suitor?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              The massive fellow... Brom. For someone you call &quot;friend,&quot; 
              he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              He has proposed to me twice.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the 
              answer was &quot;no&quot; at least once.</p>
            <p>Katrina looks down, discards this with a smile.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              I've read a great deal about your New York City. Do be a dear and 
              tell me all about it. Sounds like an extraordinary place to live 
              a life.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Extra ordinary, yes. But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.</p>

            <p>The Horseman circles, under fire.</p>
            <p>Great clouds of gun smoke shoot from the church.</p>
            <p>Men fire down from the belfry.</p>
            <p>Parts of the Horseman and Daredevil splatter red into the rain 
              as slugs hit without effect.</p>
            <p>AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHURCH, the Horseman comes around, heading 
              to the town square.</p>
            <p>INT. CHURCH -- DAY</p>
            <p>Rifleman shout to each other, running to the opposite windows to 
              follow the Horseman.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath grabs a rifle and leaps to join the brigade.</p>
            <p>Baltus is still beating Steenwyck's door when a HUGE FARMER grips 
              Baltus angrily and throws him...</p>
            <p>HUGE FARMER<br>
              You'll kill us all!</p>
            <p>Baltus falls, knocking over pews. Katrina's nearby.</p>
            <p>HUGE FARMER<br>
              You're the one the Horseman wants. Why should we die for you!?</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              NO!</p>
            <p>The huge farmer picks Baltus up, dragging him and shoving Katrina 
              aside as she approaches.</p>
            <p>Ichabod's pushing past people, trying to reach them.</p>
            <p>EXT. CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- DAY</p>
            <p>The Horseman brings Daredevil to a halt, yanking a large coil of 
              ROPE off a hitching post.</p>
            <p>INT. CHURCH -- DAY</p>
            <p>The huge farmer shoves Baltus to the floor again.</p>
            <p>HUGE FARMER<br>
              Get out!</p>
            <p>Others join the rage, pulling Baltus towards the front of the church, 
              shouting. Ichabod struggles to push them off.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Stop this!</p>
            <p>Ichabod gets to Baltus, side, trying to protect.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              The Horseman cannot enter! It does not matter who he wants, he cannot 
              cross the gate!<br>
              At the windows, ONE RIFLEMAN turns, crying out.</p>
            <p>ONE RIFLEMAN<br>
              He's coming back!</p>
            <p>More panic. The huge farmer moves towards Baltus.</p>
            <p>HUGE FARMER<br>
              We have to save ourselves!</p>
            <p>Baltus pulls the pistol from Ichabod's holster, brandishing.</p>

              No! Get away from me!</p>
            <p>EXT. CHURCH -- DAY</p>
            <p>The Horseman rides past the front, fired upon.</p>
            <p>He halts at the wrought iron gate, reaching to yank off one POST 
              which is pointed on top. like an arrow head.</p>
            <p>INT. CHURCH -- DAY</p>
            <p>Baltus holds everyone's back with the pistol.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              The next person to lay hands on me will have a bullet. Stand off!</p>

              No! We're safe here.<br>
              (points at Ichabod)<br>
              You said it. The Horseman will not have me.</p>
            <p>CRASH the harpoon-like post SPEARS through a window, trailing rope 
              tied to it...</p>
            <p>CRACK -- SKEWERS Baltus from behind, the bloodied point bursting 
              out his breast bone.</p>
            <p>Baltus looks down, drops the gun... clutching the post with both 
              hands. Blood streams out his mouth. Katrina screams.</p>
            <p>The rope yanks Baltus back. He SLAMS into the WINDOW...</p>
            <p>EXT. CHURCH -- DAY</p>

            <p>Outside the fence, Daredevil runs with the rope tied around his 
              saddle pommel. The Horseman strides forward, sword out.</p>
            <p>Baltus SLAMS the fence and the-rope snaps. He is held there awkwardly,, 
              gurgling blood.</p>
            <p>The Horseman reaches Baltus... chops off his head.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. SLEEPY HOLLOW FORESTS -- DAY</p>
            <p>The storm has passed. Empty forest. Long, peaceful pause, till 
              Ichabod makes his way through, searching the ground.</p>
            <p>Ichabod comes to look down a small hill. The corpse of Lady, Van 
              Tassel lies headless, in a dirty, torn dress.</p>
            <p>Ichabod walks to the body. Lady Van Tassel's arm is twisted behind. 
              The sewn cut on the palm of her hand faces up.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (shouting back)<br>
              Here! I have found her...<br>
              (looking at corpse, quiet and miserable)<br>
              Here she is.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL -- EARLY EVENING</p>
            <p>Doctor Lancaster comes out from where Katrina is asleep. He closes 
              the door, wipes his sweaty face. Ichabod waits.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER<br>
              It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              You will stay at her side?</p>
            <p>Doctor Lancaster nods. Ichabod walks.</p>
            <p>EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- EARLY EVENING</p>
            <p>It's getting dark. Ichabod comes out and crosses the porch. A few 
              of the Hollow's residents are here. Young Masbath gets up and follows 
              Ichabod onto the lawn.</p>
            <p>Ichabod walks without waiting.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir? Sir?<br>
              (no answer)</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I need time for thinking. Without you hanging on my coattails for 
              a change.</p>
            <p>Ichabod keeps walking. Young Masbath stops, wounded.</p>
            <p>EXT. WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod stands holding a torch, looking up. The whole area is bright 
              from the light off a giant fire.</p>
            <p>There are broken lanterns and barrels around the agonized, twisted 
              tree. The tree is aflame, fire dancing up the trunk. and through 
              every branch to lick the sky.</p>
            <p>EXT. FOREST -- DAY</p>
            <p>Dawn. Ichabod is seated overlooking the Hudson. He stares at the 
              beauty around him, brooding through bleary eyes. Gunpowder is tied 
              to a tree. BIRDS SING.</p>
            <p>The ledger is open in Ichabod's lap. He thumbs pages absently, 
              just keeps staring off.</p>
            <p>EXT. FOREST -- DAY (TIME CUT)</p>
            <p>A fire burns in a circle of rocks. Ichabod's ledger is thrown in. 
              The pages catch quickly.</p>
            <p>Ichabod watches, then walks away. He's about to climb onto Gunpowder, 
              but on second thought he opens his satchel and digs out a BOOK. 
              He walks back to the fire, throws it on...</p>
            <p>&quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot; Flames devour it.</p>
            <p>EXT. WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY</p>
            <p>The clearing is silent. The twisted tree still stands, smoldering, 
              impressive as ever, or perhaps even more so with the alien appearance 
              its blackened skin now affords it.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod packs up baggage. Young Masbath is miserable.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Nothing. To hell with this place and all the people here.</p>
            <p>Ichabod closes a bag, throws it with others.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Why... why are you like this?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (pause, softening)<br>
              You do not know all that has happened.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              You cannot understand.</p>
            <p>EXT. VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>A coach, with Gunpowder as one of its team, waits in the orchard. 
              Van Ripper comes to meet Ichabod and Masbath.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Half now. Half when we reach the city.</p>
            <p>Ichabod hands Van Ripper money. Van Ripper takes the baggage. Ichabod 
              looks to the Manor House. Only one light shines, in a second floor 
              window.</p>
            <p>Katrina can be seen there a moment as she closes curtains.</p>
            <p>Ichabod turns to Young Masbath, who is beginning to cry.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              This is farewell.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Take me with you. There's nothing left for me here.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I cannot.<br>
              (bends to Masbath)<br>
              You should not worry.<br>
              (pause, sorrow)<br>
              Van Ripper and his wife will look after you. They will. You will 
              be well cared for.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath hugs. Ichabod hugs back, swallowing.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I am sorry.<br>
              (quietly)<br>
              Forgive me. I failed you.</p>
            <p>Ichabod releases and goes quickly away, finding this misery unbearable. 
              He climbs in the coach.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Do not go, Constable. How can you leave?</p>
            <p>INSIDE THE COACH, Ichabod slumps back in darkness and closes his 
              eyes. He pounds twice on the coach wall.</p>
            <p>OUTSIDE, Van Ripper whips the reins. The coach starts. Young Masbath 
              follows. The coach picks up speed on the long straight road.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath stops, wiping tears.</p>
            <p>EXT. TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod's coach moves through the town square. A few people in 
              the churchyard's tent city come out to watch it pass.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>The door is pushed open. Young Masbath enters, looks around the 
              empty room. He goes to sit in a chair at the work table, crossing 
              his arms and resting his head.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>A plate of food sits untouched. Katrina is slumped down in a chair, 
              heartbroken, staring into the fireplace.</p>
            <p>Behind her, a shadow moves across the room.</p>
            <p>EXT. THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Van Ripper leads the coach through the stone pillars marking the 
              entrance of Sleepy Hollow.</p>
            <p>INT. ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod takes off his hat, sets it on the seat. The window between 
              him and the driver slides open.</p>
            <p>VAN RIPPER<br>
              Sir... this is yours.<br>
              (offering something)<br>
              The Van Tassel girl said to give it to you after you were gone.</p>
            <p>Ichabod takes it. It is the bird/cage spinning toy. He studies 
              it. What melancholy.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Katrina sits with her eyes closed. A BOARD is HEARD CREAKING. She 
              sits up. Suddenly, a FIGURE in black is behind her as she turns. 
              WRACK! -- a gloved fist strikes.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>A dull THUD is HEARD downstairs, like a body falling. Young Masbath 
              takes notice. He moves to the door...</p>
            <p>INT. ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod turns the strings on the bird/cage toy, ponders it.</p>
            <p>The paper disk spins, images flickering until the bird appears 
              to be inside the cage.</p>
            <p>Ichabod keeps spinning it, looks out the window.</p>
            <p>A tear rolls down his cheek.</p>
            <p>The bird cage toy's rotation slows... stops.</p>
            <p>Ichabod looks at it a long moment, then pockets it and leans forward 
              to the window at front.</p>
            <p>OUTSIDE THE COACH</p>
            <p>Ichabod's face appears behind Van Ripper.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Van Ripper, turn the coach about!</p>
            <p>VAN RIPPER<br>
              What did you say?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Turn around. Now!</p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Young Masbath comes down the stairs, looking around meekly.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Hello? Katrina?</p>
            <p>Masbath starts down a hall. He does not see, in another room, Katrina's 
              body is dragged across the floor.</p>

            <p>He that is only real, had need have exceeding great parts of virtue: 
              as the stone <br>
              had need to be rich, that is set without foil. But if a man mark 
              it well, it is in <br>
              praise and commendation of men as it is in gettings and gains: for 
              the proverb is <br>
              true, that light gains make heavy purses; for light gains come thick, 
              whereas great <br>
              come but now and then. So it is true, that small matters win great 
              commendation, <br>
              because they are continually in use, and in note: whereas the occasion 
              of any great <br>
              virtue cometh but on festivals. </p>
            <p>Therefore it doth much add to a man\'s reputation, and is (as Queen 
              Isabella said) like perpetual letters commendatory, to have good 
              forms. To attain them, it almost sufficeth, not to despise them: 
              for so shall a man observe them in others: and let him trust himself 
              with the rest. For if he labour too much to express them, he shall 
              lose their grace; which is to be natural and unaffected. </p>
            <p>Some men\'s behaviour is like a verse, wherein every syllable is 
              measured: <br>
              how can a man comprehend great matters, that hreaketh his mind too 
              much to small observations? Not to use ceremonies at all, is to 
              teach others not to use them again; and so diminisheth respect to 
              himself: especially they be not to be omitted to <br>
              strangers, and formal natures: but the dwelling upon them, and exalting 
              them above <br>
              the moon, is not only tedious, but doth diminish the faith and credit 
              of him that <br>
              speaks. </p>
            <p>And certainly, there is a kind of conveying of effectual and imprinting 
              <br>
              passages, amongst compliments, which is of singular use, if a man 
              can hit upon it <br>
              Amongst a man\'s peers, a man shall be sure of familiarity; and 
              therefore, it is good <br>
              a little to keep state. Amongst a man\'s inferiors, one shall be 
              sure of reverence; <br>
              and therefore it is good a little to be familiar. He that is too 
              much in anything, <br>
              so that he giveth another occasion of satiety, maketh himself cheap. 
              To apply one\'s self to others is good: so it be with demonstration, 
              that a man doth it upon regard and not upon facility. It is a good 
              precept, generally in seconding another, yet to add somewhat of 
              one\'s own: as if you will grant his opinion, let it be with some 
              distinction; if you will follow his motion, let it be with condition; 
              if you allow <br>
              his counsel, let it be with alleging further reason. Men had need 
              beware, how they <br>
              be too perfect in compliments; for be they never so sufficient otherwise, 
              their <br>
              enviers will be sure to give them that attribute, to the disadvantage 
              of their greater <br>
              virtues. It is loss also in business, to be too full of respects, 
              or to be too curious <br>
              in observing times and opportunities. Solomon saith; He that considered! 
              the wind <br>
              shall not sow, and he that looketh to the clouds shall not reap. 
              A wise man will make more opportunities than he finds. Men\'s behaviour 
              should be like their apparel, not too strait, or point device, but 
              free for exercise or motion.</p>

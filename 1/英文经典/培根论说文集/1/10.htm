            <p align="center" class="h">10 Of Love 
            <p>The stage is more beholding to love, than the life of man. For 
              as to the stage, love is ever matter of comedies, and now and then 
              of tragedies: but in life, it doth much mischief: sometimes like 
              a siren; sometimes like a fury. You may observe, that amongst all 
              the great and worthy persons (whereof the memory remaineth, either 
              ancient or recent) there is not one, that hath been transported 
              to the mad degree of love: which shows, that great spirits, and 
              great business, do keep out this weak passion. </p>
            <p>You must except, nevertheless, Marcus Antonius the half partner 
              of the empire of Rome; and Appius Claudius the decemvir, and lawgiver: 
              whereof the former was indeed a voluptuous man, and inordinate; 
              but the latter was an austere and wise man: and therefore it seems 
              (though rarely) that love can find entrance, not only into an open 
              heart; but also into a heart well fortified, if watch be not well 
              kept It is a poor saying of Epicurus, satis magnum alter alteri 
              theatrum sumus: as if man, made for the contemplation of heaven 
              and all noble objects, should do nothing, but kneel before a little 
              idol, and make himself subject, though not of the mouth (as beasts 
              are) yet of the eye; which was given him for higher purposes. It 
              is a strange thing, to note the excess of this passion; and how 
              it braves the nature and value of things; by this, that the speaking 
              in a perpetual hyperbole is comely in nothing but in love. Neither 
              is it merely in the phrase; for whereas it hath been well said, 
              that the arch-flatterer, with whom all the petty flatterers have 
              intelligence, is a man\'s self; certainly, the lover is more. For 
              there was never proud man thought so absurdly well of himself, as 
              the lover doth of me person loved: and therefore, it was well said; 
              mat it is impossible to love, and to be wise. Neither doth (his 
              weakness appear to others only, and not to the party loved; but 
              to the loved, most of all: except the love be reciproque. <br>
            </p>
            <p>For it is a true rule, that love is ever rewarded, either with 
              the reciproque, or <br>
              with an inward and secret contempt. By how much the more, men ought 
              to beware of this passion, which loseth not only other things, but 
              itself. As for the other losses, the poet\'s relation doth well 
              figure them; that he that preferred Helena, quitted the gifts of 
              Juno, and Pallas. For whosoever esteemeth too much of amorous affection, 
              quitteth both riches, and wisdom. This passion hath his floods in 
              the very times of weakness; which are, great prosperity; and great 
              adversity; though this latter hath been less observed. Both which 
              times kindle love, and make it more fervent, and therefore show 
              it to be the child of folly. They do best, who, if they cannot but 
              admit love, yet make it keep quarter:<br>
              and sever it wholly from their serious affairs, and actions of life: 
              for if it check <br>
              once with business, it troubleth men s fortunes, and maketh men, 
              that they can no ways be true to their own ends. I know not how, 
              but martial men are given to love: I think it is, but as they are 
              given to wine; for perils commonly ask to be paid in pleasures. 
              There is in man\'s nature, a secret inclination, and motion, towards 
              love of others; which, if it be not spent upon some one, or a few, 
              doth naturally spread itself towards many; and maketh men become 
              humane, and charitable; as it is seen sometime in friars. Nuptial 
              love maketh mankind; friendly love perfecteth it; but wanton love 
              corrupteth and embaseth it.</p>

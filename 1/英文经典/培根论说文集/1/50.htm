            <p align="center" class="h">50 Of Studies 
            <p>Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. Their 
              chief use for delight, <br>
              is in privateness and retiring; for ornament, is in discourse; and 
              for ability, is in the judgement and disposition of business. For 
              expert men can execute, and perhaps judge of particulars, one by 
              one; but the general counsels, and the plots, and marshalling of 
              affairs, come best from those that are learned. </p>
            <p>To spend too much time in studies, is sloth; to use them too much 
              for ornament, is affectation; to make judgement wholly by their 
              rules is the humour of a scholar. They perfect nature, and are perfected 
              by experience: for natural abilities are like natural plants, that 
              need pruning by study: and studies themselves do give forth directions 
              too much at large, except they be bounded in by experience. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Crafty men condemn studies; simple men admire them; and wise men 
              use them: for they teach not their own use; but that is a wisdom 
              without them, and above them, won by observation. Read not to contradict, 
              and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to find talk 
              and discourse; but to weigh and consider. Some books are to be tasted, 
              others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested: 
              that is, some books are to be read only in parts; others to be read 
              but not curiously; and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence 
              and attention. </p>
            <p>Some books also may be read by deputy, and extracts made of them 
              by others: but that would be, only in the less important arguments, 
              and the meaner sort of book: else distilled books are like common 
              distilled waters, flashy things. Reading maketh a full man; conference 
              a ready man; and writing an exact man. </p>
            <p>And therefore, if a man write little, he had need have a great 
              memory; <br>
              if he confer lime, he had need have a present wit; and if he read 
              little, he had need <br>
              have much cunning, to seem to know that he doth not. Histories make 
              men wise; poets witty; the mathematics subtle; natural philosophy 
              deep; moral grave;<br>
              logic and rhetoric able to contend. AbeuntstucSa in mores. Nay, 
              there is no stond <br>
              or impediment in the wit, but may be wrought out by fit studies: 
              like as diseases <br>
              of the body may have appropriate exercises. Bowling is good for 
              the stone and reins; shooting for the lungs and breast; gentle walking 
              for the stomach; riding for the head; and the like. </p>
            <p>So if a man\'s wit be wandering, let him study the mathematics; 
              for in demonstrations, if his wit be called away never so little, 
              he must begin again: <br>
              if his wit be not apt to distinguish or find differences, let him 
              study the schoolmen; <br>
              for they are cymnisectores. If he be not apt to beat over matters, 
              and to call up <br>
              one thing, to prove and illustrate another, let him study the lawyers\' 
              cases: so every <br>
              defect of the mind may have a special receipt.</p>

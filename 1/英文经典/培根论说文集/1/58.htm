            <p>Solomon saith; There is no new thing upon the earth. So that as 
              Plato had an imagination, that all knowledge was but remembrance: 
              so Solomon giveth his sentence, that all novelty is but oblivion. 
            </p>
            <p>Whereby you may see, that the river of Lethe runneth as well above 
              ground, as below. There is an abstruse astrologer that saith; If 
              it were not for two things, that are constant (the one is, that 
              (he fixed stars ever stand at like distance, one from another, and 
              never come nearer together, nor go further asunder, the other, that 
              the diurnal motion perpetually keepeth time); no individual would 
              last one moment </p>
            <p>Certain it is, that the matter is in a perpetual flux, and never 
              at a stay. The great winding-sheets, that bury all things in oblivion, 
              are two; deluges, and earthquakes. As for conflagrations, and great 
              droughts, they do not merely dispeople, and destroy. Phaeton\'s 
              car went but a day. And the three years\' drought, in the time of 
              Elias, was but particular, and left people alive. </p>
            <p>As for the great burnings by lightnings, which are often in the 
              West Indies, they are but narrow. <br>
            </p>
            <p>But in the other two destructions, by deluge, and earthquake, it 
              is further to be <br>
              noted, that the remnant of people which hap to be preserved, are 
              commonly ignorant and mountainous people, that can give no account 
              of the time past: so that the oblivion is all one, as if none had 
              been left. If you consider well, of the people of the West Indies, 
              it is very probable that they are newer or a younger people, than 
              the people of the old world. And it is much more likely, that the 
              destruction that hath heretofore been there, was not by earthquakes 
              (as the Egyptian priest told Solon, concerning the Island of Auantis; 
              that it was swallowed by an earthquake), but rather, that it was 
              desolated by a particular deluge. For earthquakes are seldom in 
              those parts. But on the other side, they have such pouring rivers, 
              as the rivers of Asia and Africa and Europe are but brooks to them. 
              Their Andes likewise, or mountains, arc far higher than those with 
              us;<br>
            </p>
            <p>whereby it seems that the remnants of generation of men were, in 
              such a particular <br>
              deluge, saved. As for the observation, that Macbeth hath, that the 
              jealousies of sects doth much extinguish the memory of things; traducing 
              Gregory the Great, that he did what in him lay, to extinguish all 
              heathen antiquities; I do not find that those zeals do any great 
              effects, nor last long: as it appeared in the succession of Sabinian, 
              who did revive the former antiquities.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The vicissitudes or mutations in the superior globe, are no fit 
              matter for this present <br>
              argument. It may be, Plato\'s great year, if the world should last 
              so long, would have some effect; not in renewing the state of like 
              individuals (for that is the fume of those that conceive the celestial 
              bodies have more accurate influences upon these things below, than 
              indeed they have), but in gross. Comets, out of question, have likewise 
              power and effect, over the gross and mass things: but they are rather 
              gazed upon, and waited upon in their journey, than wisely observed 
              in their effects; <br>
              specially in their respective effects; that is, what kind of comet, 
              for magnitude, colour, version of the beams, placing in the region 
              of heaven, or lasting, produceth what kind of effects</p>
            <p> There is a toy which I have heard, and I would not have it given 
              over, but waited <br>
              upon a little. They say, it is observed in the Low Countries (I 
              know not in what part) that every five and thirty years, the same 
              kind and suit of years and weathers comes about again: as great 
              frosts, great wet, great droughts, warm winters, summers with little 
              heat, and the like: and they call it the prime. It is a thing I 
              do the rather mention, because computing backwards, I have found 
              some concurrence.<br>
            </p>
            <p>But to leave these points of nature, and to come to men. The greatest 
              vicissitude <br>
              of things amongst men, is the vicissitude of sects and religions. 
              For those orbs rule <br>
              in men\'s minds most The true religion is built upon the rock; the 
              rest are tossed <br>
              upon the waves of time. To speak therefore, of the causes of new 
              sects; and to give some counsel concerning them; as far as the weakness 
              of human judgement, can give stay to so great revolutions.<br>
            </p>
            <p>When the religion formerly received is rent by discords; and when 
              the holiness of <br>
              the professors of religion is decayed, and full of scandal; and 
              withal the times be stupid, ignorant, and barbarous; you may doubt 
              the springing up of a new sect; if then also there should arise 
              any extravagant and strange spirit, to make himself author thereof. 
              All which points held, when Mohammed published his <br>
              law. If a new sect have not two properties, fear it not: for it 
              will not spread. The <br>
              one is, the supplanting, or the opposing, of authority established: 
              for nothing is <br>
              more popular than that. The other is, the giving licence to pleasures, 
              and a voluptuous life. For as for speculative heresies (such as 
              were in ancient times the Arians, and now the Armenians) though 
              they work mightily upon men\'s wits, yet they do not produce any 
              great alterations in states; except it be by the help of civil occasions. 
            </p>
            <p>There be three manner of plantations of new sects. By the power 
              of signs and miracles: by the eloquence and wisdom of speech and 
              persuasion: and by the sword. For martyrdoms, I reckon them amongst 
              miracles; because they seem to exceed the strength of human nature: 
              and I may do the like of superlative and admirable holiness of life. 
            </p>
            <p>Surely, there is no better way to stop the rising of new sects, 
              and schisms; than to reform abuses; to compound the smaller differences; 
              to proceed mildly, and not with sanguinary prosecutions; and rather 
              to take off the principal authors, by winning and advancing them, 
              than to enrage them by violence and bitterness.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The changes and vicissitude in wars are many: but chiefly in three 
              things; in the <br>
              seats or stages of the war, in the weapons; and in the manner of 
              the conduct Wars <br>
              in ancient time seemed more to move from east to west: for the Persians, 
              Assyrians, Arabians, Tartars, (which were the invaders) were all 
              eastern people. It is true, the Gauls were western; but we read 
              but of two incursions of theirs; the one to Gallo-Graecia, the other 
              to Rome. But east and west have no certain points of heaven: and 
              no more have the wars, either from the east, or west, any certainty 
              of observation. <br>
            </p>
            <p>But north and south are fixed; and it hath seldom or never been 
              seen, that the far <br>
              southern people have invaded the northern, but contrariwise. Whereby 
              it is manifest, mat the northern tract of the world is in nature 
              the more martial region:<br>
              be it in respect of the stars of that hemisphere; or of the great 
              continents that <br>
              are upon the north, whereas the south part, for ought that is known, 
              is almost all <br>
              sea; or (which is most apparent) of the cold of the northern parts, 
              which is that <br>
              which without aid of discipline doth make the bodies hardest, and 
              me courages warmest<br>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the breaking and shivering of a great state and empire, you 
              may be sure to have wars. For great empires, while they stand, do 
              enervate and destroy the forces of the natives, which they have 
              subdued, resting upon their own protecting forces: and then when 
              they fail also, all goes to ruin, and they become a prey. So was 
              it, in the decay of the Roman empire; and likewise, in the empire 
              of Almaigne, after Charles the Great, every bird taking a feather, 
              and were not unlike to befall to Spain, if it should break. The 
              great accessions and unions of kingdoms do likewise stir up quarrel. 
            </p>
            <p>For when a state grows to an over-power, it is like a great flood, 
              that will be sure to <br>
              overflow. As it hath been seen, in the states of Rome, Turkey, Spain, 
              and others. <br>
              Look when the world hath fewest barbarous peoples, but such as commonly 
              will not many or generate, except they know means to live (as it 
              is almost everywhere at this day, except Tartary); there is no danger 
              of inundations of people: but when there be great shoals of people, 
              which go on to populate, without foreseeing means of life and sustentation, 
              it is of necessity, that once in an age or two, they discharge a 
              portion of their people upon other nations: which the ancient northern 
              people were wont to do by lot: casting lots, what part should stay 
              at home, and what should seek their fortunes. When a warlike state 
              grows soft and effeminate, they may be sure of a war. <br>
            </p>
            <p>For commonly such states are grown rich, in the time of their degenerating; 
              and so <br>
              the prey inviteth, and their decay in valour encourageth a war.<br>
            </p>
            <p>As for the weapons, it hardly falleth under rule and observation: 
              yet we see, even <br>
              they have returns and vicissitudes. For certain it is, that ordnance 
              was known in <br>
              the city of the Oxidrakes in India: and was that, which the Macedonians 
              called thunder and lightning, and magic. And it is well known, that 
              the use of ordnance hath been in China above two thousand years. 
              The conditions of weapons, and their improvement are; first, the 
              fetching a far off: for that outruns the danger: as it is seen in 
              ordnance and muskets. Secondly, the strength of the percussion; 
              wherein likewise ordnance do exceed all arietations, and ancient 
              inventions. The third is, the <br>
              commodious use of them: as that they may serve in all weathers; 
              that the carriage <br>
              may be light and manageable; and the like.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For the conduct of the war: at the first, men rested extremely 
              upon number: they did put the wars likewise upon main force, and 
              valour, pointing days for pitched fields, and so trying it out, 
              upon an even match: and they were more ignorant in ranging and arraying 
              their battles. After they grew to rest upon number, rather competent, 
              than vast: they grew to advantages of place, cunning diversions, 
              and the like: and they grew more skilful in the ordering of their 
              battles. hi the youth of a state, arms do flourish: in the middle 
              age of a state, learning; and then both of them together for a time: 
              in the declining age of a state, mechanical arts and merchandise. 
              Learning hath his infancy, when it is but beginning, and almost 
              childish: then his youth, when it is luxuriant and juvenile: then 
              his strength of years, when it is solid and reduced: and lastly, 
              his old age, when it waxeth dry and exhaust. But it is not good, 
              to look too long upon these turning wheels of vicissitude, lest 
              we become giddy. As for the philology of them, mat is but a circle 
              of tales, and therefore not fit for this writing.</p>
            <p>A Fragment of an Essay of Fame The poets make fame a monster. They 
              describe her, in part, finely, and elegantly; and, in part, gravely, 
              and sentendously. They say, look how many feathers she hath. so 
              many eyes she hath underneath: so many tongues; so many voices; 
              she pricks up so many ears.<br>
            </p>
            <p>This is a flourish: there follow excellent parables; as that, she 
              gathereth strength <br>
              in going; that she goeth upon the ground, and yet hideth her head 
              in the clouds. </p>
            <p>That, in the day time, she sitteth in a watch tower, and flieth 
              most by night: that she <br>
              mingleth things done, with things not done: and that she is a terror 
              to great cities: <br>
              but that which passeth all the rest, is: they do recount that the 
              earth, mother of <br>
              the giants that made war against Jupiter, and were by him destroyed, 
              thereupon, in <br>
              an anger, brought forth fame: for certain it is, that rebels, figured 
              by the giants, <br>
              and seditious fames, and libels, are but brothers, and sisters; 
              masculine, and <br>
              feminine. But now, if a man can tame this matter, and bring her 
              to feed at the hand, <br>
              and govern her, and with her fly other ravening fowl, and kill them, 
              it is somewhat <br>
              worth. But we are infected with the style of the poets. To speak 
              now in a sad, and <br>
              serious manner: there is not, in all the politics, a place less 
              handled, and more <br>
              worthy to be handled, than this of fame. We will, theretofore, speak 
              of these points. <br>
            </p>
            <p>What are false fames; and what are true fames; and how they may 
              be best discerned; how fames may be sown, and raised; how they may 
              be spread, and multiplied; and how they may be checked, and laid 
              dead. And other things, concerning the nature of fame. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Fame is of that force, as there is scarcely any great action wherein 
              it hath not a <br>
              great part; especially, in the war. Mucianus undid Vitellius by 
              a fame that he <br>
              scattered; that Vitellius had in purpose, to remove the legions 
              of Syria into Germany; and the regions of Germany into Syria: whereupon 
              the legions of Syria were infinitely inflamed. Julius Caesar took 
              Pompey unprovided, and laid asleep his industry, and preparations, 
              by a fame that he cunningly gave out; how Caesar\'s own soldiers 
              loved him not; and being wearied with the wars, and laden with the 
              spoils of Gaul, would forsake him, as soon as he came into Italy. 
              Livia settled all things, for the succession of her son Tiberius, 
              by continual giving out that her husband Augustus was upon recovery, 
              and amendment And it is an usual thing, with the bashaws, to conceal 
              the death of the great Turk from the Janissaries, and men of war, 
              to save the sacking of Constantinople, and other towns, as their 
              manner is. Themistocles made Xerxes, king of Persia, post apace 
              out ofGraecia, by giving out that the Grecians had a purpose to 
              break his bridge of ships, which he made athwart Hellespont There 
              be a thousand such like examples;<br>
              and the more they are, the less they need to be repeated; because 
              a man meeteth with them everywhere: therefore, let all wise governors 
              have as great a watch, and care, over fames, as they have of the 
              actions and designs themselves.<br>
              The rest was not finished.</p>

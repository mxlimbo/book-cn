            <p align="center" class="h">19 Of Empire 
            <p>It is a miserable state of mind, to have few things to desire, 
              and many things to <br>
              fear: and yet that commonly is the case of kings; who being at the 
              highest, want matter of desire, which makes their minds more languishing; 
              and have many representations of perils and shadows, which makes 
              their minds the less clear. </p>
            <p>And this is one reason also of that effect, which the scripture 
              speaketh of; that the king\'s heart is inscrutable. For multitude 
              of jealousies, and lack of some predominant desire, that should 
              marshal and put in order all the rest, maketh any man\'s heart hard 
              to find, or sound. Hence it comes likewise, that princes, many times, 
              make themselves desires, and set their hearts upon toys: sometimes 
              upon a building; sometimes upon erecting of an order, sometimes 
              upon the advancing of a person; sometimes upon obtaining excellency 
              in some art, or feat of the hand; as Nero for playing on the harp, 
              Domitian for certainty of the hand with the arrow, Commodus for 
              playing at fence, Caracalla for driving chariots, and the like. 
              This seemeth incredible unto those that know not the principle; 
              that the mind of man is more cheered, and refreshed, by profiting 
              in small things, than by standing at a stay in great We see also 
              that kings, that have been fortunate conquerors in their first years; 
              it being not possible for them to go forward infinitely, but that 
              they must have some check or arrest in their fortunes; turn in their 
              latter years to be superstitious and melancholy: as did Alexander 
              the Great;<br>
              Dioclesian; and in our memory, Charles the Fifth; and others: for 
              he that is used <br>
              to go forward, and findeth a stop, falleth out of his own favour, 
              and is not the thing he was.<br>
            </p>
            <p>To speak now of the true temper of empire: it is a thing rare, 
              and hard to keep: for both temper and distemper consist of contraries. 
              But it is one thing to mingle <br>
              contraries, another to interchange them. The answer of Apollonius 
              to Vespasian is full of excellent instruction; </p>
            <p>Vespasian asked him; What was Nero\'s overthrow? He answered;<br>
              Nero could touch and tune the harp well; but in government, sometimes 
              he used to wind the pins too high, sometimes to let them down too 
              low. And certain it is, that nothing destroyeth authority so much, 
              as the unequal and untimely interchange of power pressed too far, 
              and relaxed too much.<br>
            </p>
            <p>This is true; that the wisdom of all these latter times in princes\' 
              affairs, is rather <br>
              fine deliveries, and shiftings of dangers and mischiefs, when they 
              are near, than <br>
              solid and grounded courses to keep them aloof. But this is but to 
              try masteries with fortune: and let men beware, how they neglect, 
              and suffer matter of trouble to be prepared: for no man can forbid 
              the spark, nor tell whence it may come. </p>
            <p>The difficulties in princes\' business are many and great; but 
              the greatest difficulty, is often in their own mind. For it is common 
              with princes (saith Tacitus) to will contradictories. Sunt plerumque.\'region 
              voluntates vehementes et inter se contrariae. For it is the solecism 
              of power, to think to command the end, and yet not to endure the 
              mean.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Kings have to deal with their neighbours; their wives; their children; 
              their prelates <br>
              or clergy; their nobles; their second-nobles or gentlemen; their 
              merchants; their <br>
              commons; and their men of war, and from all these arise dangers, 
              if care and <br>
              circumspection be not used.<br>
            </p>
            <p>First for their neighbours; there can no general rule be given 
              (the occasions are <br>
              so variable), save one; which ever holdeth; which is, that princes 
              do keep due sentinel, that none of their neighbours do overgrow 
              so (by increase of territory, by embracing of trade, by approaches, 
              or the like), as they become more able to annoy them, than they 
              were. And this is, generally, the work of standing councils to foresee, 
              and to hinder it During that triumvirate of kings. King Henry Vffl 
              of England, Francis I, King of France, and Charles V, Emperor, there 
              was such a watch kept, that none of the three could win a palm of 
              ground, but the other two would straightways balance it, either 
              by confederation, or, if need were, by a war: and would not, in 
              any wise, take up peace at interest And the like was done by that 
              league (which, Guicciardine saith, was the security of Italy) made 
              between Ferdinando King of Naples; Lorenzius Medices, and Ludovicus 
              Sforza, potentates, the one of Florence, the other of Milan. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is the opinion of some of the schoolmen to be received; 
              that a war cannot justly be made, but upon a precedent injury, or 
              provocation. For there is no question, but a just fear of an imminent 
              danger, though there be no blow given, is a lawful cause of a war.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For their wives; there are cruel examples of them. Livia is enfamed 
              for the poisoning of her husband: Roxolana, Solyman\'s wife, was 
              the destruction of that renowned prince. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Sultan Mustapha; and otherwise troubled his house, and succession: 
              Edward the Second of England his queen had the principal hand, in 
              the deposing and murder of her husband. <br>
            </p>
            <p>This kind of danger is then to be feared, chiefly, when the wives 
              have plots for the raising of their own children; or else that they 
              be adulteresses.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For their children: the tragedies, likewise, of dangers from them, 
              have been many. <br>
            </p>
            <p>And generally, the entering of fathers into suspicion of their 
              children, hath been <br>
              ever unfortunate. The destruction of Mustapha (that we named before) 
              was so fatal to Solyman\'s line, as the succession of the Turks, 
              from Solyman, until this day, is suspected to be untrue, and of 
              strange blood; for mat Selymus the </p>
            <p>Second was thought to be supposititious. The destruction of Crispus, 
              a young prince of rare towardness, by Constantinus the Great, his 
              father, was in like manner fatal to his house; for both Constantinus, 
              and Constance, his sons, died violent deaths; and Constantius, his 
              other son, did little better; who died, indeed, of sickness, but 
              after that Julianus had taken arms against him. The destruction 
              of Demetrius, son to Philip the Second, of Macedonia, turned upon 
              the father, who died of repentance. And many like examples there 
              are: but few, or none, where the fathers had good by such distrust; 
              except it were, where me sons were up in open arms against them; 
              as was Selymus the First against Baiazet: and the three sons of 
              Henry the Second, King of England.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For their prelates; when they are proud and great, there is also 
              danger from them: <br>
              as it was, in the times of Anselmus, and Thomas Becket, Archbishops 
              of Canterbury; who with their croziers, did almost try it, with 
              the king\'s sword; and yet they had to deal with stout and haughty 
              kings; William Rufus, Henry the </p>
            <p>First, and Henry the Second. The danger is not from that state, 
              but where it hath a dependence of foreign authority; or where the 
              churchmen come in, and are elected, not by the collation of the 
              king, or particular patrons, but by the people.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For their nobles; to keep them at a distance, it is not amiss; 
              but to depress them, <br>
              may make a king more absolute, but less safe; and less able to perform 
              anything that he desires. I have noted it, in my history of King 
              Henry the Seventh of England, who depressed his nobility; whereupon, 
              it came to pass that his times were full of difficulties, and troubles; 
              for the nobility, though they continued loyal unto him, yet did 
              they not cooperate with him in his business. So that in effect, 
              he was fain to do all things, himself.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For their second nobles; there is not much danger from them, being 
              a body dispersed. They may sometimes discourse high, but that doth 
              little hurt: besides, they are a counterpoise to the higher nobility, 
              that they grow not too potent: and lastly, being the most immediate 
              in authority, with the common people, they do best temper popular 
              commotions.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For their merchants; they are venaporta; and if they flourish not, 
              a kingdom may have good limbs, but will have empty veins, and nourish 
              lime. Taxes, and imposts upon them, do seldom good to the king\'s 
              revenue; for that that he wins in the hundred, he loseth in the 
              shire; the particular rates being increased, but the total bulk 
              of trading rather decreased.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For their commons; there is little danger from them, except it 
              be, where they have great and potent heads; or where you meddle 
              with the point of religion; or their customs, or means of life.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For their men of war, it is a dangerous state, where they live 
              and remain in a body, and are used to donatives; whereof we see 
              examples in the Janissaries, and Pretorian bands of Rome: but trainings 
              of men, and arming them in several places, and under several commanders, 
              and without donatives, are things of defence, and no danger.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Princes are like to heavenly bodies, which cause good or evil times;<br>
              and which have much veneration, but no rest All precepts concerming 
              kings, are in effect comprehended in those two remembrances: memento 
              quod es homo\', and memento quod es deus, or vice da\', the one 
              bridleth their power, and the other their will.</p>

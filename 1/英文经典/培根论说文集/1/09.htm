            <p>There be none of the affections, which have been noted to fascinate 
              or bewitch, but love, and envy. They both have vehement wishes; 
              they frame themselves readily into imaginations, and suggestions; 
              and they come easily into toe eye; especially upon toe presence 
              of toe objects; which are toe points that conduce to fascination, 
              if any such thing there be. </p>
            <p>We see likewise, toe scripture calleth envy an evil eye: and toe 
              astrologers call toe evil influences of toe stars, evil aspects; 
              so that still, there seemeth to be acknowledged, in toe act of envy, 
              an ejaculation or irradiation of toe eye. Nay, some have been so 
              curious as to note, toat toe times, when toe stroke, or percussion 
              of an envious eye doth most hurt, are when toe party envied is beheld 
              in glory, or triumph; for toat sets an edge upon envy; and besides, 
              at such times, toe spirit of toe person envied do come forth most 
              into <br>
              toe outward parts, and so meet toe blow. But leaving these curiosities 
              (though not unworthy, to be thought on, in fit place), we will handle, 
              what persons are apt to envy others; what persons are most subject 
              to be envied themselves; and, what is toe difference between public 
              and private envy.</p>
            <p> A man toat hath no virtue in himself, ever envieth virtue in others. 
              For men\'s minds will either feed upon their own good, or upon others\' 
              evil; and who wanteth toe one, will prey upon toe other, and who 
              so is out of hope to attain to another\'s virtue, will seek to come 
              at even hand, by depressing another\'s fortune. </p>
            <p>A man toat is busy, and inquisitive, is commonly envious: for to 
              know much of other men\'s matters, cannot be, because all toat ado 
              may concern his own estate: therefore it must needs be, toat he 
              taketh a kind of play-pleasure, in looking upon toe fortunes of 
              others; neither can he, toat mindeth but his own business, find 
              much matter for envy. For envy is a gadding passion, and walketh 
              the streets, and doth not keep home; non est curiosus, quin idem 
              malevolus.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Men of noble birth are noted to be envious towards new men, when 
              they rise. For the distance is altered; and it is like a deceit 
              of the eye, that when others come on, they think themselves go back.</p>
            <p> Deformed persons, and eunuchs, and old men, and bastards, are 
              envious: for he that cannot possibly mend his own case, will do 
              what he can to impair another\'s; except these defects light upon 
              a very brave and heroical nature; which thinketh to make his natural 
              wants, part of his honour: in that it should be said, that an eunuch, 
              or a lame man, did such great matters; affecting the honour of a 
              miracle; as it was in Narses the eunuch, and Agesilaus, and Tamberlanes, 
              that were lame men. </p>
            <p>The same is the case of men that rise after calamities, and misfortunes; 
              for they <br>
              are, as men fallen out with the times; and think other men\'s harms 
              a redemption of their own sufferings. They that desire to excel 
              in too many matters, out of levity and vain glory, are ever envious; 
              for they cannot want work; it being impossible, but many, in some 
              one of those things, should surpass them. Which was the character 
              of Hadrian the Emperor, that mortally envied poets, and painters, 
              and artificers, in works wherein he had a vein to excel.</p>
            <p> Lastly, near kinsfolk, and fellows in office, and those that have 
              been bred together, are more apt to envy their equals, when they 
              are raised. For it doth upbraid unto them their own fortunes; and 
              pointeth at them, and cometh oftener into their remembrance, and 
              incurreth likewise more into the note of others: and envy ever redoubled! 
              from speech and fame. Cain\'s envy was the more vile and malignant, 
              towards his brother Abel, because, when his sacrifice was better 
              accepted, there was nobody to look on. Thus much for those that 
              are apt to envy. </p>
            <p>Concerning those that are more or less subject to envy: first, 
              persons of eminent <br>
              virtue, when they are advanced, are less envied. For their fortune 
              seemeth but due unto them; and no man envieth me payment of a debt, 
              but rewards and liberality rather. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Again, envy is ever joined with the comparing of a man\'s self; 
              and where there is <br>
              no comparison, no envy; and therefore kings are not envied but by 
              kings. </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, it is to be noted, that unworthy persons are most 
              envied at their first coming in, and afterwards overcome it better; 
              whereas contrariwise, persons of worth and merit are most envied 
              when their fortune continueth long. For by that time, though their 
              virtue be the same, yet it hath not the same lustre; for fresh men 
              grow up, that darken it.</p>
            <p> Persons of noble blood are less envied in their rising: for it 
              seemeth but right, <br>
              done to their birth. Besides, there seemeth not much added to their 
              fortune; and envy is as the sunbeams, that beat hotter upon a bank 
              or steep rising ground than upon a flat. And for the same reason, 
              those that are advanced by degrees are less envied than those that 
              are advanced suddenly, and per salturn.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Those that have joined with their honour, great travels, cares, 
              or perils, are less <br>
              subject to envy. For men think, that they earn their honours hardly, 
              and pity them sometimes; and pity ever healeth envy: wherefore, 
              you shall observe that the more deep and sober sort of politic persons, 
              in their greatness, are ever bemoaning themselves, what a life they 
              lead; chanting a quanta patimur. Not that they feel it so, but only 
              to abate the edge of envy. But this is to be understood, of business 
              that is laid upon men, and not such as they call unto themselves. 
              For nothing increaseth envy more, than an unnecessary and ambitious 
              engrossing of business. And nothing doth extinguish envy more, than 
              for a great person to preserve all other inferior officers, in their 
              full rights, and pre-eminence of their places. For by that means, 
              there be so many screens between him and envy.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Above all, those are most subject to envy, which cany the greatness 
              of their fortunes in an insolent and proud manner: being never well, 
              but while they are showing how great they are, either by outward 
              pomp, or by triumphing over all opposition, or competition; whereas 
              wise men will rather do sacrifice to envy; in suffering themselves, 
              sometimes of purpose to be crossed, and overborne in things, that 
              do not much concern them. Notwithstanding, so much is true; that 
              the carriage of greatness, in a plain and open manner (so it be 
              without arrogance, and vain glory) doth draw less envy, than if 
              it be in a more crafty and cunning fashion. For in that course, 
              a man doth but disavow fortune; and seemeth to be conscious of his 
              own want in worth; and doth but teach others to envy him.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, to conclude this part; as we said in the beginning, that 
              the act of envy, <br>
              had somewhat in it, of witchcraft; so there is no other cure of 
              envy, but the cure <br>
              of witchcraft: and that is, to remove the lot (as they call it) 
              and to lay it upon <br>
              another. For which purpose, the wiser sort of great persons bring 
              in ever upon the stage somebody, upon whom to derive the envy, that 
              would come upon themselves; sometimes upon ministers, and servants; 
              sometimes upon colleagues and associates; and the like; and for 
              that turn, there are never wanting, some persons of violent and 
              undertaking natures, who so they may have power, and business, will 
              take it at any cost Now to speak of public envy. There is yet some 
              good in public envy; whereas in private, there is none. For public 
              envy is as an ostracism, that eclipseth men, when they grow too 
              great And therefore it is a bridle also to great ones, to keep them 
              within bounds.</p>
            <p> This envy, being in the Latin word invidia, goeth in the modem 
              languages, by the name of discontentment: of which we shall speak 
              in handling sedition. It is a disease, in a stale, like to infection. 
              For as infection spreadeth upon that which is sound, and tainteth 
              it; so when envy is gotten once into a state, it traduceth even 
              the best actions thereof, and turneth them into an ill odour. And 
              therefore, there is little won by intermingling of plausible actions. 
              For that doth argue but a weakness, and fear of envy, which hurteth 
              so much the more, as it is likewise usual in infections; which if 
              you fear them, you call them upon you.</p>
            <p> This public envy seemeth to beat chiefly upon principal officers, 
              or ministers, rather than upon kings, and estates themselves. But 
              this is a sure rule, that if the envy upon the minister be great, 
              when the cause of it in him is small; or if the envy be general, 
              in a manner, upon all the ministers of an estate; then the envy 
              (though hidden) is truly upon the estate itself. And so much of 
              public envy or discontentment, and the difference thereof from private 
              envy, which was handled in the first place.</p>
            <p> We will add this, in general, touching the affection of envy; 
              that of all other <br>
              affections, it is the most importune, and continual. For of other 
              affections, mere <br>
              is occasion given, but now and then: and therefore, it was well 
              said, invidia festos dies non agit. For it is ever working upon 
              some or other. And it is also noted, that love and envy do make 
              a man pine. Which other affections do not; because they are not 
              so continual. It is also the vilest affection, and the most depraved; 
              for which cause, it is me proper attribute of the devil, who is 
              called:<br>
              the envious man, that soweth tares amongst the wheat by night As 
              it always cometh to pass, that envy worketh subtly, and in the dark; 
              and to the prejudice of good things, such as is the wheat.</p>

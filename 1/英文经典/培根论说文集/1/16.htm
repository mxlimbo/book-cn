            <p>I had rather believe all the fables in the Legend, and the Talmud, 
              and the Alcoran, than that this universal frame is without a mind. 
              And therefore, God never wrought miracle to convince atheism, because 
              his ordinary works convince it It is true, that a little philosophy 
              inclineth man\'s mind to atheism; but depth in philosophy bringelh 
              <br>
              men\'s minds about to religion: for while the mind of man looketh 
              upon second causes scattered, it may sometimes rest in them, and 
              go no further: but when it beholdeth the chain of them, confederate 
              and linked together, it must needs fly to providence, and deity. 
              Nay, even mat school which is most accused of atheism, doth most 
              demonstrate <br>
              religion; that is, the school of Leucippus, and Democritus, and 
              Epicurus. </p>
            <p>For it is a thousand times more credible, that four mutable elements, 
              and one immutable fifth essence, duly and eternally placed, needs 
              no God, than mat an army of infinite small proportions, or seeds 
              unplaced, should have produced this order, and beauty, without <br>
              a divine marshal. </p>
            <p>The scripture saith; The fool hath said in his heart, mere is no 
              <br>
              God: it is not said; The fool hath thought in his heart: so as, 
              he rather saith it by rote to himself, as that he would have, than 
              (hat he can thoroughly believe it, or be persuaded of it For none 
              deny there is a God, but those, for whom it maketh that there were 
              no God. It appeareth in nothing more, mat atheism is radher in die 
              <br>
              lip, man in die heart of man, man by this; dial atheists will ever 
              be talking of that their opinion, as if they fainted in it, within 
              themselves, and would be glad to be strengthened, by me consent 
              of others: nay more, you shall have atheists strive to get disciples, 
              as it faredh with other sects: and, which is most of all, you shall 
              have of mem, mat will suffer for adieism, and not recant; whereas, 
              if they did truly <br>
              think, mat mere were no such dung as God, why should diey trouble 
              themselves? Epicurus is charged, that he did but dissemble, for 
              his credit\'s sake, when he affirmed, there were blessed natures, 
              but such as enjoyed themselves, without having respect to the <br>
              government of the world. </p>
            <p>Wherein, they say, he did temporise; though in secret, he <br>
              thought, there was no God. But certainly, he is traduced; for his 
              words are noble and divine: non deos vulgi negare profanum, sed 
              vulgi opines diis applicare prcfanum. </p>
            <p>Plato could have said no more. And although he had the confidence 
              to deny the administration, he had not the power to deny the nature. 
              The Indians of the West have names for their particular gods, though 
              they have no name for God: as if the heathens should have had the 
              names Jupiter, Apollo, Mars, &amp;c., but not the word deus: which 
              shows, that even those barbarous people have the notion, though 
              they <br>
              have not the latitude, and extent of it So that against atheists, 
              the very savages take part, with the very subtlest philosophers. 
              The contemplative atheist is rare; a Diagoras, a Bion, a Lucian 
              perhaps, and some others; and yet they seem to be more than they 
              are; for that, all that impugn a received religion, or superstition, 
              are by the adverse part branded with the name of atheists. </p>
            <p>But me great atheists, indeed, are hypocrites; which are ever handling 
              holy things, but without feeling. So as they must needs be cauterised 
              in the end. The causes of atheism are; divisions in religion, if 
              they be many; for any one main division addeth zeal to both sides; 
              but many divisions introduce atheism. </p>
            <p>Another is, scandal of priests; when it is come to that, which 
              St Bernard saith; mon est ian dicere, ut populus ,sic sacerdos:quia 
              nes populus,ut sacerdos. A third is, custom of profane scoffing 
              in holy <br>
              matters; which doth, by little and little, deface the reverence 
              of religion. And lastly, learned times, specially with peace, and 
              prosperity: for troubles and adversities do more bow men\'s minds 
              to religion. </p>
            <p>They that deny a God, destroy man\'s nobility; for certainly, man 
              is of kin to the beasts, by his body; and if he be not of kin to 
              God, by his spirit, he is a base and ignoble creature. It destroys 
              likewise magnanimity, and the raising of human nature: for take 
              an example of a dog; and mark what a generosity and courage he will 
              put on, when he finds himself maintained by a man; who to him is 
              in stead of a God, or melior natura: which courage is manifestly 
              such as that creature, without that confidence of a better nature 
              than his own, could never attain. </p>
            <p>So man, when he resteth and assureth himself upon divine protection, 
              and favour, gathereth a force and faith; which human nature, in 
              itself, could not obtain. </p>
            <p>Therefore, as atheism is in all respects hateful, so in this, that 
              it depriveth human nature of the means to exalt itself, above human 
              frailty. As it is in particular persons, so it is in nations: never 
              was there such a state, for magnanimity, as Rome: of this state 
              hear what Cicero saith; Quam volumus licet. patres conscripti, nos 
              amemus, tamen nec numero Hispans, nec robore Gallos, mec calliditate 
              Poems, nec <br>
              artibus Graecos.nec denique hoc ipso huius gentis et terrae domestico 
              nativoque sensu Itlos ipsos et Latinos; sed pietate, ac religione, 
              atque hac una sapientia, quod deorum imortalium numine omnia regi 
              gubernarique perspeximus, ormes gentes nationesque superavimus.</p>

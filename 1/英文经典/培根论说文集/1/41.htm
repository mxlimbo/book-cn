            <p align="center" class="h">41 Of Usury 
            <p>Many have made witty invectives against usury. They say, that it 
              is pity, the devil <br>
              should have God\'s part, which is the tithe. That the usurer is 
              me greatest Sabbath <br>
              breaker, because his plough goeth every Sunday. That the userer 
              is the drone, that <br>
              Virgil speaketh of: ignavum fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent.<br>
            </p>
            <p>That the usurer breaketh the first law that was made for mankind, 
              after the fall; <br>
              which was, in sudore vultus tui comedes panem tuum; not, in sudore 
              vultus aliem. That usurers should have orange-tawny bonnets, because 
              they do Judaise. That it is against nature, for money to beget money; 
              and the like. I say this only, that usury is a concessum propter 
              duritiem cads\', for since there must be borrowing and lending, 
              and men are so hard of heart as they will not lend freely, usury 
              must be permitted. Some others have made suspicious and cunning 
              propositions of banks, discovery of men\'s estates, and other inventions. 
            </p>
            <p>But few have spoken of usury usefully. It is good to set before 
              us the incommodides, and commodities of usury; that the good may 
              be either weighed out, or culled out; and warily to provide, that 
              while we make forth to that which is better, we meet not with that 
              which is worse.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The discommodities of usury are: first, that it makes fewer merchants. 
              For were it <br>
              not for this lazy trade of usury, money would not lie still, but 
              would, in great part, <br>
              be employed upon merchandising; which is the vena porta of wealth 
              in a state. The <br>
              second, that it makes poor merchants. For as a fanner cannot husband 
              his ground so well, if he sit at a great rent; so the merchant cannot 
              drive his trade so well, if <br>
              he sit at great usury. The third is incident to the other two; and 
              that is, the decay of customs of kings or states, which ebb or flow 
              with merchandising. The fourth, that it bringeth the treasure of 
              a realm or state into a few hands. For the usurer being at certainties, 
              and others at uncertainties, at the end of the game; most of the 
              money will be in the box; and ever a state flourisheth, when wealth 
              is more equally spread. The fifth, that it beats down the price 
              of land: for the employment of money is chiefly, either merchandising, 
              or purchasing; and usury waylays both. The sixth, that it dolh dull 
              and damp all industries, improvements, and new inventions, wherein 
              money would be stirring, if it were not for this slug. The last, 
              that it is the cancer and ruin of many men\'s estates; which in 
              process of time breeds a public poverty.</p>
            <p> On the other side, the commodities of usury are. First, that howsoever 
              usury in some respect hindereth merchandising, yet in some other 
              it advanceth it: for it is certain, that the greatest part of trade 
              is driven by young merchants, upon borrowing at interest: so as 
              if the usurer either call in, or keep back his money, there will 
              ensue presently a great stand of trade. The second is, that were 
              it not for this easy borrowing upon interest, men\'s necessities 
              would draw upon them a most sudden undoing; in that they would be 
              forced to sell their means (be it lands or goods) far under foot; 
              and so, whereas duty doth but gnaw upon them, bad markets would 
              swallow them quite up. </p>
            <p>As for mortgaging, or pawning, it will lime mend the matter, for 
              either men will not take pawns without use; or if they do, they 
              will look precisely for the forfeiture. I remember a cruel moneyed 
              man, in the country, that would say; the devil <br>
              take this usury, it keeps us from forfeitures of mortgages and bonds. 
              The third and <br>
              last is; that it is a vanity to conceive that there would be ordinary 
              borrowing without <br>
              profit; and it is impossible to conceive the number ofinconveniencies 
              that will ensue, if borrowing be cramped. </p>
            <p>Therefore, to speak of the abolishing of usury is idle. All states 
              have ever had it, in one kind or rate, or other. So as that opinion 
              must be sent to Utopia.<br>
            </p>
            <p>To speak now, of the reformation and reiglement of usury; how the 
              discommodities of it may be best avoided, and the commodities retained. 
              It appears by the balance of commodities and discommodities of usury, 
              two things are to be reconciled. The one, that the tooth of usury 
              be grinded, that it bite not too much: the other, that there be 
              left open a means, to invite moneyed men to lend to the merchants, 
              for the continuing and quickening of trade. This cannot be done, 
              except you introduce two several sorts of usury; a less, and a greater. 
              For if you reduce usury to one low rate, it will ease the common 
              borrower, but the merchant will be to seek for money. And it is 
              to be noted that the trade of merchandise, being the most lucrative, 
              may bear usury at a good rate; other contracts not so.<br>
            </p>
            <p>To serve both intentions, the way would be briefly thus. That there 
              be two rates of <br>
              usury, the one free, and general for all; the other under licence 
              only, to certain <br>
              persons, and in certain places of merchandising. First therefore, 
              let usury, in <br>
              general, be reduced to five in the hundred; and let that rate be 
              proclaimed to be <br>
              free and current; and let the state shut itself out, to take any 
              penalty for the same. <br>
            </p>
            <p>This will preserve borrowing from any general stop or dryness. 
              This will ease infinite borrowers in the country. This will, in 
              good part, raise the price of land, because land purchased at sixteen 
              years purchase will yield six in the hundred, and somewhat more, 
              whereas this rate of interest yields but five. This, by like reason, 
              will encourage and edge industrious and profitable improvements; 
              because many will rather venture in that kind, than take five in 
              the hundred, especially having been used to greater profit Secondly, 
              let there be certain persons licensed to lend, to known merchants, 
              upon usury at a higher rate; and let it be with the cautions following. 
            </p>
            <p>Let the rate be, even with the merchant himself, somewhat more 
              easy, than that he <br>
              used formerly to pay: for, by that means, all borrowers shall have 
              some ease by this reformation, be he merchant, or whosoever. Let 
              it be no rank or common stock, but every man be master of his own 
              money: not that I altogether mislike banks, but they will hardly 
              be brooked, in regard of certain suspicions. Let me state be answered, 
              some small matter, for the licence, and the rest left to the lender: 
              for if the abatement be but small, it will no whit discourage the 
              lender. For he, for example, that took before ten or nine in the 
              hundred, will sooner descend to eight in the hundred, than give 
              over his trade of usury, and go from certain gains, to gains of 
              hazard. </p>
            <p>Let these licenced lenders be in number indefinite, but restrained 
              to certain <br>
              principal cities and towns of merchandising: for then they will 
              be hardly able to <br>
              colour other men\'s monies in the country: so as the licence of 
              nine will not suck <br>
              away the current rate of five: for no man will send his monies far 
              off, nor put them <br>
              into unknown hands.<br>
            </p>
            <p>If it be objected that this doth, in a sort, authorise usury, which 
              before was, in <br>
              some places, but permissive: the answer is; mat it is better to 
              mitigate usury by <br>
              declaration, than to suffer it to rage by connivance.</p>

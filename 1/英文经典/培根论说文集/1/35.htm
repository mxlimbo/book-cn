            <p align="center" class="h">35 Of Prophecies
            <p>I mean not to speak of divine prophecies; nor of heathen oracles; 
              nor of natural <br>
              predictions; but only of prophecies, that have been of certain memory, 
              and from hidden causes. Saith the Pythonissa to Saul; Tomorrow thou 
              and thy son shall be with me Homer hath these verses: at domus Aeneae 
              cunctis dominabitur oris, et nati natorum, et qui nascentur ab illis: 
              a prophecy, as it seems, of the Roman Empire. Seneca the tragedian 
              hath these verses: venient annis secula seris, quibus Oceanus vincula 
              rerum laxet, et ingens pateat tellus, Tiphysque novos detegat orbes; 
              nec sit terris ultima Thule: a prophecy of the discovery of America. 
              The daughter of Polycrates dreamed that Jupiter bathed her father, 
              and Apollo anointed him: and it came to pass, that he was crucified 
              in an open place, where the sun made his body run with sweat, and 
              the rain washed it. Philip of Macedon dreamed, he sealed up his 
              wife\'s belly: whereby he did expound it, that his wife should be 
              barren: but Aristander the soothsayer told him, his wife was with 
              child, because men do not use to seal vessels that are empty. </p>
            <p>A phantasm that appeared to M. Brutus in his tent said to him; 
              Philippis iterum me <br>
              videbis. Tiberius said to Galba: tu quoque, Galba, degustabis imperium. 
              In <br>
              Vespasian\'s time, there went a prophecy in the East; that those 
              that should come forth of Judea, should reign over the world: which 
              though it may be was meant of our saviour, yet Tacitus expounds 
              it of Vespasian. Domidan dreamed, the night before he was slain, 
              that a golden head was growing out of the nape of his neck: and 
              indeed, the succession that followed him, for many years, made golden 
              times. Henry the Sixth of England, said of Henry the Seventh, when 
              he was a lad, and gave him water. </p>
            <p>This is the lad, that shall enjoy the crown, for which we strive. 
              When I was in France, I heard from one Dr Pena, that the Queen Mother, 
              who was given to curious arts, caused the King her husband\'s nativity 
              to be calculated under a false name; and the astrologer gave a judgement, 
              that he should be killed in a duel; at which the Queen laughed, 
              thinking her husband to be above challenges and duels: but he was 
              slain, upon a course at tilt, the splinters of the staff of Mongomery 
              going in at his beaver. The trivial prophecy, which I heard, when 
              I was a child, and Queen Elizabeth was in the flower of her years, 
              was; When hempe is spun, England\'s done. Whereby, it was generally 
              conceived, that after the princes had reigned, which had the principal 
              letters of that word hempe (which were Henry, Edward, Mary, Philip, 
              and Elizabeth), England should come to utter confusion: which, thanks 
              be to God, is verified only in the change of the name: for that 
              the King\'s style is now no more of England, but of Britain. There 
              was also another prophecy, before the year of 1688, which I do not 
              well understand:<br>
            </p>
            <p>There shall be seen upon a day, Between the baugh, and the may, 
              The black fleet of Norway. When that that is come and gone, England 
              build houses of lime and stone For after wars shall you have none.<br>
            </p>
            <p>It was generally conceived, to be meant of the Spanish fleet, that 
              came in 1688. For <br>
              that the King of Spain\'s surname, as they say, is Norway. The prediction 
              of <br>
              Regiomontanus; octogesimus octavus marabilis annus; was thought 
              likewise accomplished, in the sending of that great fleet, being 
              the greatest in strength, though not in number, of all that ever 
              swam upon the sea. </p>
            <p>As for Cleon\'s dream, I think it was a jest It was, that he was 
              devoured of a long dragon; and it was expounded of a maker of sausages, 
              that troubled him exceedingly. There are numbers of the like kind; 
              especially if you include dreams, and predictions of astrology. 
              But I have set down these few only of certain credit, for example. 
              My judgement is, that they ought all to be despised; and ought to 
              serve, but for winter talk by the fireside. Though when I say despised, 
              I mean it as for belief: for otherwise, the spreading or publishing 
              of them is in no sort to be despised. For they have done much mischief: 
              and I see many severe laws made to suppress them. </p>
            <p>That, that hath given them grace, and some credit, consisteth in 
              three things. First, that men mark, when they hit, and never mark, 
              when they miss: as they do, generally, also of dreams. The second 
              is, that probable conjectures, or obscure traditions, many times 
              turn themselves into prophecies: while the nature of man, which 
              coveteth divination, thinks it no peril to foretell that, which 
              indeed they do but collect. As that of Seneca\'s verse. For so much 
              was then subject to demonstration, that the globe of the earth had 
              great parts beyond the Atlantic; which mought be probably conceived, 
              not to be all sea: and adding thereto the tradition in Plato\'s 
              Timaeus, and his Atlanticus, it mought encourage one, to turn it 
              to a prediction. The third, and last (which is the great one) is, 
              that almost all of them, being infinite in number, have been impostures, 
              and by idle and crafty brains, merely contrived and feigned, after 
              the event past.</p>

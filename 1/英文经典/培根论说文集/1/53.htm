            <p>Praise is the reflection of virtue. But it is as the glass or body, 
              which giveth the <br>
              reflection. If it be from the common people, it is commonly false 
              and naught: and <br>
              rather followeth vain persons, than virtuous: for the common people 
              understand not many excellent virtues: the lowest virtues draw praise 
              from them; the middle virtues work in them astonishment, or admiration; 
              but of the highest virtues, they have no sense or perceiving at 
              all. But shows, and speciesvirtutibus arnUes, serve best with them. 
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, fame is like a river, that beareth up things light and 
              swollen, and <br>
              drowns things weighty and solid: but if persons of quality and judgement 
              concur, then it is, (as the scripture saith) nomen bonwn mstar unguentifragrontis. 
              It fillelh all <br>
              round about, and will not easily away. For me odours of ointments 
              are more durable, than those of flowers. There be so many false 
              points of praise, that a man may justly hold it a suspect Some praises 
              proceed merely of flattery; and if he be an ordinary flatterer, 
              he will have certain common attributes, which may serve every man; 
              if he be a cunning flatterer, he will follow the arch-flatterer, 
              which is a man\'s self; and wherein a man thinketh that of himself, 
              therein the flatterer will uphold him <br>
              most; but if he be an impudent flatterer, look wherein a man is 
              conscious to himself <br>
              that he is most defective, and is most out of countenance in himself, 
              that will the <br>
              flatterer entitle him to, perforce, spretaconsdentia. Some praises 
              come of good <br>
              wishes, and respects, which is a form due in civility to kings, 
              and great persons, <br>
              laiidandopmedperv\', when by telling men what they are, they represent 
              to them what they should be. </p>
            <p>Some men are praised maliciously to their hurt, thereby to stir 
              envy and jealousy towards them; pesswiwn genus inmvcomm hudanlaan; 
              in so much as it was a proverb, amongst the Grecians; that, he that 
              was praised to his hurt, should have a push rise upon his nose: 
              as we say; that a blister will rise upon one\'s tongue, that tells 
              a lie. </p>
            <p>Certainly moderate praise, used with opportunity, and not vulgar, 
              is that which doth the good. Solomon saith. He that praiseth his 
              friend aloud, rising early, it shall be to him no better than a 
              curse. Too much magnifying of man or matter doth irritate contradiction, 
              and procure envy and scorn. To praise a man\'s self cannot <br>
              be decent, except it be in rare cases: but to praise a man\'s office 
              or profession, <br>
              he may do it with good grace, and with a kind of magnanimity. </p>
            <p>The cardinals of Rome, which are theologues, and friars, and schoolmen, 
              have a phrase of notable contempt and scorn towards civil business: 
              for they call all temporal business, of wars, embassages, judicature, 
              and other employments, sbarene\', which is, under-sheriffiies; as 
              if they were but matters for under-sheriffs and catohpoles; though 
              many times, those under-sheriffiies do more good than their high 
              speculations. St Paul, when he boasts of himself, he doth oft interlace; 
              I speak like a fool; but speaking of his calling, he saith.</p>

            <p>The joys of parents are secret; and so are their griefs, and fears: 
              they cannot utter the one; nor they will not utter the other. Children 
              sweeten labours; but they make misfortunes more bitter they increase 
              the cares of life; but they mitigate the <br>
              remembrance of death. The perpetuity by generation is common to 
              beasts; but memory, merit, and noble works, are proper to men: and 
              surely a man shall see the noblest works and foundations have proceeded 
              from childless men; which have sought to express the images of their 
              minds where those of their bodies have failed: so the care of posterity 
              is most in them that have no posterity. They that are the first 
              raisers of then-houses, are most indulgent towards their children; 
              beholding them, as the continuance, not only of their kind, but 
              of their work; and so both children and creatures.</p>
            <p> The difference in affection of parents towards their several children 
              is many times unequal; and sometimes unworthy; especially in the 
              mother, as Solomon saith; A wise son rejoiceth the father, but an 
              ungracious son shames the mother. </p>
            <p>A man shall see, where there is a house full of children, one or 
              two of the eldest respected, and the youngest made wantons; but 
              in the midst, some mat are, as it were forgotten, who many times, 
              nevertheless, prove the best The illiberality of parents, in allowance 
              towards their children, is an harmful error, makes them base; acquaints 
              them with shifts; makes them sort with mean company; and makes them 
              surfeit more, when they come to plenty: and therefore, the proof 
              is best, when men keep their authority towards their children, but 
              not their purse. Men have a foolish manner (both parents, and schoolmasters, 
              and servants) in creating and breeding an emulation between brothers, 
              during childhood, which many times sorted to discord, when they 
              are men; and disturbed! families. The Italians make little difference 
              between children, and nephews, or near kinsfolk; but so they be 
              of the lump, they care not, though they passe not through <br>
              their own body. And, to say truth, in nature it is much a like matter, 
              in so much, <br>
              that we see a nephew sometimes resembleth an uncle, or a kinsman, 
              more then his own parent; as the blood happens. Let parents choose 
              betimes the vocations and courses they mean their children should 
              take; for then they are most flexible; and let them not too much 
              apply themselves to the disposition of their children, as thinking 
              they will take best to mat, which they have most mind to. It is 
              true, that if the affection or aptness of the children be extraordinary, 
              then it is good not to cross it; but generally, the precept is good; 
              optimum eli ge, suave et facile illud faciet consuetude). Younger 
              brothers are commonly fortunate, but seldom or never where the elder 
              are disinherited.</p>

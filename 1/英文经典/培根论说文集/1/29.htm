              Estates
            <p>The speech of Themistocles the Athenian, which was haughty and 
              arrogant, in taking so much to himself, had been a grave and wise 
              observation and censure, applied at large to others. Desired at 
              a feast to touch a lute, he said; He could not fiddle, but yet he 
              could make a small town, a great city. These words (holpen a little 
              with a metaphor) may express two differing abilities, in those mat 
              deal in business of estate. For if a true survey be taken, of counsellors 
              and statesmen, there may be found (though rarely) those which can 
              make a small state great and yet cannot fiddle: as on the other 
              side, there will be found a great many, that can fiddle very cunningly, 
              but yet are so far from being able to make a small state great as 
              their gift lieth the other way; to bring a great and flourishing 
              estate to ruin and decay. And certainly, those degenerate arts and 
              shifts, whereby many counsellor and governors gain both favour with 
              their masters, and estimation with the vulgar, deserve no better 
              name then fiddling; being things rather pleasing for the time, and 
              graceful to themselves only, than tending to the weal and advancement 
              of the state which they serve. </p>
            <p>There are also (no doubt) counsellor and governors, which may be 
              held sufficient (negotus pares), able to manage affairs, and to 
              keep them from precipices and manifest inconveniences; which nevertheless, 
              are far from the ability to raise and amplify an estate, in power, 
              means, and fortune. But be the workmen what they may be, let us 
              speak of the work; that is, the true greatness of kingdoms and estates; 
              and the means thereof. An argument, fit for great and mighty princes 
              to have in their hand; to the end, that neither by over-measuring 
              their forces, they lose themselves in vain enterprises; nor on the 
              other side, by undervaluing them, they descend to fearful and pusillanimous 
              counsels.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The greatness of an estate in bulk and territory doth fall under 
              measure; and the <br>
              greatness of finances and revenue doth fall under computation. The 
              population may <br>
              appear by musters: and the number and greatness of cities and towns, 
              by cards and <br>
              maps. But yet there is not anything amongst civil affairs more subject 
              to error, than <br>
              the right valuation, and true judgement, concerning the power and 
              forces of an estate. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The kingdom of Heaven is compared, not to any great kernel or nut, 
              but to a grain <br>
              of mustard-seed; which is one of the least grains, but hath in it 
              a property and spirit, hastily to get up and spread. So are there 
              states, great in territory, and yet not <br>
              apt to enlarge, or command; and some, that have but a small dimension 
              of stem, and yet apt to be the foundations of great monarchies.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Walled towns, stored arsenals and armouries, goodly races of horse, 
              chariots of war, elephants, ordnance, artillery, and the like: all 
              this is but a sheep in a lion\'s <br>
              skin, except the breed and disposition of the people be stout and 
              warlike. Nay, number (itself) in armies, importeth not much, where 
              the people is of weak courage: for (as Virgil saith) It never troubles 
              a wolf how many the sheep be. The army of the Persians in the plains 
              of Arbela was such a vast sea of people, as it did somewhat astonish 
              the commanders in Alexander\'s army; who came to him therefore, 
              and wished him to set upon them by night; but he answered, he would 
              not pilfer the victory. </p>
            <p>And the defeat was easy. When Tigranes the Armenian, being encamped 
              upon a hill, with four hundred thousand men, discovered the army 
              of the Romans being not above fourteen thousand marching towards 
              him, he made himself merry with it, and said; Yonder men are too 
              many for an ambassage and too few for a fight. But before the sun 
              set, he found them enough to give him the chase, with infinite slaughter. 
              Many are the examples, of the great odds between number and courage: 
              so that a man may truly make a judgement, that the principal point 
              of greatness in any state is to have a race of military men. Neither 
              is money the sinews of war (as it is trivially said), where the 
              sinews of men\'s arms, in base and effeminate people, are failing. 
              For Solon said well to Croesus (when in ostentation he showed him 
              his gold), Sir, if any other come that hath better iron than you 
              he will be master of all this gold. Therefore let any prince or 
              state think soberly of his forces, except his militia of natives 
              be of good and valiant soldiers. <br>
            </p>
            <p>And let princes, on the other side, that have subjects of martial 
              disposition, know <br>
              their own strength; unless they be otherwise wanting unto themselves. 
              As for mercenary forces (which is the help in this case), all examples 
              show; that, whatsoever estate or prince doth rest upon them, he 
              may spread his feathers for a time but he will mew them soon after.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The blessing of Judah and Issachar will never meet; that the same 
              people or nation, <br>
              should be both the lion\'s whelp and the ass between burthens: neither 
              will it be, <br>
              that a people over-laid with taxes should ever become valiant, and 
              martial. It is <br>
              true, that taxes levied by consent of the estate, do abate men\'s 
              courage less; as <br>
              it hath been seen notably, in the excises of the Low Countries; 
              and in some degree, <br>
              in the subsidies of England. For you must note, that we speak now 
              of the heart, and not of the purse. So that, although the same tribute 
              and tax laid by consent, or by imposing, be all one to the purse, 
              yet it works diversely upon the courage. So that you may conclude; 
              that no people over-charged with tribute is fit for empire.<br>
              Let states that aim at greatness, take heed how their nobility and 
              gentlemen do <br>
              multiply too fast. For that maketh the common subject grow to be 
              a peasant, and base swain, driven out of heart, and in effect but 
              the gentleman\'s labourer. </p>
            <p>Even as you may see in coppice woods; if you leave your staddles 
              too thick, you shall never have clean underwood, but shrubs and 
              bushes. So in countries, if the gentlemen be too many, the commons 
              will be base; and you will bring it to that, that not the hundred 
              poll will be fit for an helmet: especially as to the infantry, which 
              is the nerve of an army: and so there will be <br>
              great population, and little strength. This, which I speak of, hath 
              been nowhere <br>
              better seen, then by comparing of England and France; whereof England, 
              though far less in territory and population, hath been (nevertheless) 
              an overmatch; in regard, the middle people of England make good 
              soldiers, which the peasants of France do not And herein, the device 
              of King Henry the Seventh, (whereof I have spoken largely in the 
              history of his life) was profound, and admirable; in making farms, 
              and houses of husbandry, of a standard; that is, maintained with 
              such a proportion of land unto mem, as may breed a subject to live 
              in convenient plenty, and no servile condition; and to keep the 
              plough in the hands of the owners, and not mere hirelings. </p>
            <p>And thus indeed, you shall attain to Virgil\'s character, which 
              he gives to ancient Italy: terra potens arrnis atque ubere glebae. 
              Neither is that state (which for anything <br>
              I know, is almost peculiar to England and hardly to be found anywhere 
              else, except <br>
              it be perhaps in Poland) to be passed over; I mean die state of 
              free servants and <br>
              attendants upon noblemen and gentlemen; which are no ways inferior 
              unto the yeomanry for arms. </p>
            <p>And therefore, out of all question, the splendour, and magnificence, 
              and <br>
              great retinues, and hospitality of noblemen and gentlemen received 
              into custom, doth much conduce unto martial greatness. Whereas, 
              contrariwise, the close and reserved living of noblemen and gentlemen 
              causeth a penury of military forces.<br>
            </p>
            <p>By all means, it is to be procured, that the trunk of Nebuchadnezzar\'s 
              tree of monarchy be great enough to bear the branches, and the boughs; 
              that is, that the natural subjects of the crown or state bear a 
              sufficient proportion to the stronger subjects that they govern. 
              Therefore all states, that are liberal of naturalisation towards 
              strangers, are fit for empire. For to think that an handful of people 
              can, with the greatest courage and policy in the world, embrace 
              too large extent of dominion, it may hold for a time, but it will 
              fail suddenly. The Spartans were a nice people, in point of naturalisation; 
              whereby, while they kept their compass, they stood firm; but when 
              they did spread, and their boughs were becoming too great for their 
              stem, they became a windfall upon the sudden. Never any state was, 
              in this point, so open to receive strangers into their body, as 
              were the Romans. </p>
            <p>Therefore it sorted with them accordingly; for they grew to the 
              greatest monarchy. Their manner was, to grant naturalisation (which 
              they called ins civitatis), and to grant it in the highest degree; 
              that is, not only ins conmercci, ius connubii, ius heredHatis; but 
              also, ius suffragii, and ius honorum. And this, not to singular 
              persons alone, but likewise to whole families; yea to cities, and 
              sometimes to nations. Add to this, their custom of plantation of 
              colonies; whereby the Roman plant was removed into the soil of other 
              nations. And putting both constitutions together, you will say, 
              that it was not the Roman that spread upon the world; but it was 
              the world that spread upon the Romans: and that was the sure way 
              of greatness. I have marvelled sometimes at Spain, how they clasp 
              and contain so large dominions, with so few natural Spaniards: but 
              sure, the whole compass of Spain is a very great body of a tree; 
              far above Rome and Sparta at the first And besides, though they 
              have not had that usage, to naturalise liberally; yet they have 
              that, which is next to it; that is, to employ almost indifferently 
              all nations in their militia of ordinary soldiers: yea, and sometimes 
              in their highest commands. Nay, it seemeth at this instant, they 
              are sensible of this want of natives; as by the Pragmatical Sanction, 
              now published, appeareth.<br>
            </p>
            <p>It is certain, that sedentary and within-door arts, and delicate 
              manufactures (that <br>
              require rather the finger than the arm) have, in their nature, a 
              contrariety to a <br>
              military disposition. And generally, all warlike people are a little 
              idle; and love <br>
              danger better then travail: neither must they be too much broken 
              of it, if they shall be preserved in vigour. </p>
            <p>Therefore, it was great advantage, in the ancient states of Sparta, 
              Athens, Rome and others, that they had the use of slaves which commonly 
              did rid those manufactures. <br>
            </p>
            <p>But that is abolished, in greatest part, by the Christian law. 
              That which cometh <br>
              nearest to it, is to leave those arts chiefly to strangers (which 
              for that purpose <br>
              are the more easily to be received), and to contain the principal 
              bulk of the vulgar <br>
              natives, within those three kinds; tillers of the ground; free servants; 
              and <br>
              handy-craftsmen of strong and manly arts, as smiths, masons, carpenters, 
              etc.; not <br>
              reckoning professed soldiers.<br>
            </p>
            <p>But above all, for empire and greatness, it importeth most; that 
              a nation do profess <br>
              arms, as their principal honour, study, and occupation. For the 
              things, which we <br>
              formerly have spoken of, are but habitations towards arms: and what 
              is habilitation <br>
              without intention and act? Romulus, after his death (as they report, 
              or feign) sent <br>
              a present to the Romans; that, above all, they should intend arms; 
              and then, they <br>
              should prove the greatest empire of the world. The fabric of the 
              state of Sparta was <br>
              wholly (though not wisely) framed, and composed, to that scope and 
              end. The </p>
            <p>Persians and Macedonians had it for a flash. The Gauls, Germans, 
              Goths, Saxons, Normans and others, had it for a time. The Turks 
              have it, at this day, though in great declination. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Of Christian Europe, they that have it, are, in effect, only the 
              Spaniards. But it <br>
              is so plain, that every man profiteth in that he most intendeth, 
              that it needeth not <br>
              to be stood upon. It is enough to point at it; that no nation, which 
              doth not directly <br>
              profess arms, may look to have greatness fall into their mouths. 
              And, on the other <br>
              side, it is a most certain oracle of time; that those states, that 
              continue long in that profession (as the Romans and Turks principally 
              have done) do wonders. And those that have professed arms but for 
              an age, have notwithstanding commonly attained that greatness in 
              that age, which maintained them long after, when their profession 
              and exercise of arms hath grown to decay.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Incident to this point is; for a state, to have those laws or customs, 
              which may reach forth unto them just occasions (as may be pretended) 
              of war. For there is that justice imprinted in the nature of men, 
              that they enter not upon wars (whereof so many calamities do ensue) 
              but upon some, at the least specious, grounds and quarrels. </p>
            <p>The Turk hath at hand, for cause of war, the propagation of his 
              law or sect; a quarrel that he may always command. The Romans, though 
              they esteemed the extending the limits of their empire to be great 
              honour to their generals, when it was done, yet they never rested 
              upon that alone, to begin a war. First therefore, let nations, that 
              pretend to greatness, have this; that they be sensible of wrongs, 
              either upon borderers, merchants, or politic ministers; and mat 
              they sit not too long upon a provocation. </p>
            <p>Secondly, let them be pressed and ready to give aids and succours, 
              to their <br>
              confederates: as it ever was with the Roman: in so much, as if the 
              confederate had <br>
              leagues defensive with divers other states, and upon invasion offered, 
              did implore <br>
              their aids severally, yet the Romans would ever be the foremost, 
              and leave it to none other to have the honour. As for the wars which 
              were anciently made on the behalf of a kind of party, or tacit conformity 
              of estate, I do not see how they may be well justified: as when 
              the Romans made a war for the liberty of Greece: or when the Lacedaemonians 
              and Athenians made wars, to set up or pull down democracies, and 
              oligarchies: or when wars were made by foreigners, under the pretence 
              of justice, or protection, to deliver the subjects of others from 
              tyranny, and oppression; and the like. Let it suffice, that no estate 
              expect to be great that is not awake, upon any just occasion of 
              arming.<br>
            </p>
            <p>No body can be healthful without exercise, neither natural body, 
              nor politic: and <br>
              certainly, to a kingdom or estate, a just and honourable war is 
              the true exercise. <br>
              A civil war, indeed, is like the heat of a fever, but a foreign 
              war is like the heat <br>
              of exercise, and serveth to keep the body in health: for in a slothful 
              peace, both <br>
              courages will effeminate, and manners corrupt But howsoever it be 
              for happiness, <br>
              without all question, for greatness it maketh to be still, for the 
              most part, in arms: <br>
              and the strength of a veteran army (though it be a chargeable business), 
              always on <br>
              foot, is that, which commonly giveth the law, or at least the reputation 
              amongst all <br>
              neighbour states; as may well be seen in Spain; which hath had, 
              in one part or other, a veteran army, almost continually, now by 
              the space of six-score years.<br>
            </p>
            <p>To be master of the sea is an abridgement of a monarchy. Cicero 
              writing to Atticus, of Pompey his preparation against Caesar, saith; 
              consilium Pompeii plane Themistocum est; putat enim, qui mari potitur, 
              eum rerum potiri. And, without doubt, Pompey had tired out Caesar, 
              if upon vain confidence, he had not left that way. We see the great 
              effects of battles by sea. The battle of Actium decided the empire 
              of the world. The battle of Lepanto arrested the greatness of the 
              Turks. </p>
            <p>There be many examples, where sea-fights have been final to the 
              war; <br>
              but this is, when princes or states have set up their rest upon 
              the battles. But thus <br>
              much is certain; that he that commands the sea is at great liberty, 
              and may take as <br>
              much, and as little of the war, as he will. Whereas those that be 
              strongest by land, <br>
              are many times nevertheless in great straits. Surely, at this day, 
              with us of Europe, <br>
              the vantage of strength at sea (which is one of the principal dowries 
              of this kingdom of Great Britain) is great: both because, most of 
              the kingdoms of Europe are not merely inland, but girt with the 
              sea, most part of their compass; and because, the wealth of both 
              Indies seems in great part but an accessory to the command of the 
              seas.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The wars of latter ages seem to be made in the dark, in respect 
              of the glory and honour, which reflected upon men, from the wars 
              in ancient time. There be now, for martial encouragement, some degrees 
              and orders of chivalry; which nevertheless, are conferred promiscuously 
              upon soldiers and no soldiers; and some remembrance perhaps upon 
              the scutcheon; and some hospitals for maimed soldiers; and such 
              like things. But in ancient times; the trophies erected upon the 
              place of the victory; the funeral laudatives and monuments for those 
              that died in the wars; the crowns and garlands personal; the style 
              of emperor, which the great kings of the world after borrowed; the 
              triumphs of the generals upon their return; the great donatives 
              and largesses upon the disbanding of the armies; were things able 
              to inflame all men\'s courage. But above all, that of the triumph, 
              amongst the Romans, was not pageants or gaudery, but one of the 
              wisest and noblest institutions that ever was. <br>
            </p>
            <p>For it contained three things; honour to the general; riches to 
              the treasury out of the spoils; and donatives to the army. But that 
              honour, perhaps, were not fit for monarchies; except it be in the 
              person of the monarch himself, or his sons; as it came to pass, 
              in the times of the Roman emperors, who did appropriate the actual 
              triumphs to themselves, and their sons, for such wars as they did 
              achieve in person: and left only, for wars achieved by subjects, 
              some triumphal garments, and ensigns, to the general.<br>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude; no man can, by care taking (as the scripture saith) 
              add a cubit to his <br>
              stature, in this little model of man\'s body: but in the great frame 
              of kingdoms, and <br>
              commonwealths, it is in the power of princes, or estates, to add 
              amplitude and <br>
              greatness to their kingdoms. For by introducing such ordinances, 
              constitutions, and customs, as we have now touched, they may sow 
              greatness to their posterity, and succession. But these things are 
              commonly not observed, but left to take their chance.</p>

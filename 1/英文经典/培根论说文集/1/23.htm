            <p>An ant is a wise creature for itself; but it is a shrewd thing, 
              in an orchard, or garden. And certainly, men that are great lovers 
              of themselves, waste the public. </p>
            <p>Divide with reason between self-love, and society: and be so true 
              to thy self, as thou be not false to others; specially to thy king, 
              and country. It is a poor centre of a man\'s actions, himself. <br>
              It is right earth. For that only stands fast upon his own centre; 
              whereas all things that have affinity with the heavens, move upon 
              the centre of another, which they benefit. The referring of all 
              to a man\'s self, is more tolerable in a sovereign prince; because 
              themselves are not only themselves; but their good and evil, is 
              at the peril <br>
              of the public fortune. But it is a desperate evil in a servant to 
              a prince, or a citizen in a republic. </p>
            <p>For whatsoever affairs pass such a man\'s hands, he crooketh them 
              to <br>
              his own ends: which must needs be often eccentric to the ends of 
              his master, or state. Therefore let princes, or states, choose such 
              servants as have not this mark; except they mean their service should 
              be made but the accessory. That which maketh the effect more pernicious, 
              is that all proportion is lost It were disproportion enough, for 
              the servant\'s good to be preferred before the master\'s; but yet 
              it is a greater extreme, when a little good of the servant shall 
              cany things against a great good of the master\'s. </p>
            <p>And yet that is the case of bad officers, treasurers, ambassadors, 
              generals, and other false and corrupt servants; which set a bias 
              upon their bowl, of their own petty ends, and envies, to the overthrow 
              of their master\'s great and important affairs. And for the most 
              part, the good such servants receive is after the model of their 
              own fortune;<br>
              but the hurt they sell for mat good is after the model of their 
              master\'s fortune. <br>
            </p>
            <p>And certainly, it is the nature of extreme self-lovers; as they 
              will set an house on fire, and it were but to roast their eggs: 
              and yet these men, many times, hold credit with their masters, because 
              their study is but to please them, and profit themselves: and for 
              either respect, they will abandon the good of their affairs.</p>
            <p> Wisdom for a man\'s self, is in many branches thereof, a depraved 
              thing. It is the wisdom of rats, that will be sure to leave a house, 
              somewhat before it fall. It is the wisdom of the fox, that thrusts 
              out the badger, who digged and made room for him. <br>
            </p>
            <p>It is the wisdom of crocodiles, that shed tears, when they would 
              devour. But that which is specially to be noted is that those which 
              (as Cicero says of Pompey) are sui amantes sine rivali, are many 
              times unfortunate. And whereas they have all their time sacrificed 
              to themselves, they become in the end themselves sacrifices to the 
              <br>
              inconstancy of fortune; whose wings they thought, by their self-wisdom, 
              to have pinioned.</p>

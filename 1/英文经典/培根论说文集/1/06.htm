            <p align="center" class="h">6 Of Simulation &amp; Dissimulation 
            <p>Dissimulation is but a faint kind of policy, or wisdom; for it 
              asketh a strong wit, <br>
              and a strong heart, to know when to tell truth, and to do it Therefore 
              it is me weaker sort of politics, that are the great dissemblers.</p>
            <p> Tacitus saith; Livia sorted well, with the arts of her husband, 
              and dissimulation <br>
              of her son: attributing arts or policy to Augustus, and dissimulation 
              to Tiberius. <br>
              And again, when Lucianus encourageth Vespasian, to take arms against 
              Vitellius, he saith; We rise not, against the piercing judgment 
              of Augustus, nor the extreme caution or closeness of Tiberius. These 
              properties of arts or policy, and dissimulation or closeness, are 
              indeed habits and faculties, several, and to be distinguished. For 
              if a man have that penetration of judgment, as he can discern, what 
              things are to be laid open, and what to be secreted, and what to 
              be showed at half lights, and to whom, and when (which indeed are 
              arts of state, and arts of life, as Tacitus well calleth mem), to 
              him, a habit of dissimulation is a hindrance, and a poorness. But 
              if a man cannot obtain to that judgment, then it is left to him, 
              generally, to be close, and a dissembler. For where a man cannot 
              choose, or vary in particulars, there it is good to take the safest 
              and wariest way in general; like the going softly by one that cannot 
              well see. Certainly the ablest men that ever were, have had all 
              an openness, and frankness of dealing; and a name of certainty, 
              and veracity; but then they were like horses, well managed; for 
              they could tell passing well when to stop, or turn: and at such 
              times, when they thought the case indeed required dissimulation, 
              if then they used it, it came to pass, that me former opinion, spread 
              abroad of their good faith, and clearness of dealing, made them 
              almost invisible. </p>
            <p>There be three degrees, of this hiding and veiling of a man\'s 
              self. The first closeness, reservation, and secrecy; when a man 
              leaveth himself without <br>
              observation, or without hold to be taken, what he is. The second 
              dissimulation, in the negative; when a man lets fall signs, and 
              arguments, that he is not, that he is. And the third simulation, 
              in the affirmative; when a man industriously, and expressly, feigns 
              and pretends to be that he is not. </p>
            <p>For the first of these, secrecy: it is indeed, the virtue of a 
              confessor, and assuredly, the secret man heareth many confessions; 
              for who will open himself to a blab or a babbler? But if a man be 
              thought secret, it inviteth discovery; as the more close air, sucketh 
              in the more open: and as in confession, the revealing is not for 
              worldly use, but for the ease of a man\'s heart, so secret men come 
              to the knowledge of many things, in that kind; while men rather 
              discharge their minds, than impart their minds. In few words, mysteries 
              are due to secrecy. Besides (to say truth) nakedness is uncomely, 
              as well in mind, as body; and it addeth no small reverence, to men\'s 
              manners, and actions, if they be not altogether open. As for talkers 
              and futile persons, they are commonly vain, and credulous withal. 
              For he that talketh what he knoweth, will also talk what he knoweth 
              not. Therefore set it down; that an habit of secrecy is both politic 
              and moral. And in this part, it is good, that a man\'s face give 
              his tongue leave to speak. For the discovery of a man\'s self by 
              the tracts of his countenance, <br>
              is a great weakness, and betraying; by how much, it is many times 
              more marked and believed, than a man\'s words.</p>
            <p> For the second, which is dissimulation. It followeth many times 
              upon secrecy, by a necessity: so that, he that will be secret, must 
              be a dissembler, in some degree. For men are too cunning, to suffer 
              a man to keep an indifferent carriage between both, and to be secret, 
              without swaying the balance, on either side. They will so beset 
              a man with questions, and draw him on, and pick it out of him, that 
              without an absurd silence, he must show an inclination, one way; 
              or if he do not, they will gather as much by his silence, as by 
              his speech. As for equivocations, or oraculous speeches, they cannot 
              hold out long. So that no man can be secret, except he give himself 
              a little scope of dissimulation; which is, as it were, but the skirts 
              or train of secrecy.</p>
            <p> But for the third degree, which is simulation, and false profession; 
              mat I hold more culpable, and less politic; except it be in great 
              and rare matters. </p>
            <p>And therefore a general custom of simulation (which is this last 
              degree) is a vice, <br>
              rising either of a natural falseness, or tearfulness; or of a mind, 
              that hath some <br>
              main faults; which because a man must needs disguise, it maketh 
              him practise <br>
              simulation in other things, lest his hand should be out of use.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The great advantages of simulation and dissimulation are three. 
              First to lay asleep opposition, and to surprise. For where a man\'s 
              intentions are published, it is an alarum, to call up all that are 
              against them. The second is, to reserve to a man\'s self a fair 
              retreat: for if a man engage himself, by a manifest declaration, 
              he must go through, or take a fall. The third is, the better to 
              discover the mind of another. For to him that opens himself, men 
              will hardly show themselves adverse; but will (fair) let him go 
              on, and turn their freedom of speech, to freedom of thought. </p>
            <p>And therefore, it is a good shrewd proverb of the Spaniard; tell 
              a lie, and find a troth. As if there were no way of discovery, but 
              by simulation. There be also three disadvantages, to set it even. 
              The first, that simulation and dissimulation commonly cany with 
              them a show of fearfulness, which in any business doth spoil the 
              feathers, of round flying up to the mark. The second, that it puzzleth 
              and perplexeth the conceits of many that perhaps would otherwise 
              cooperate with him; and makes a man walk, almost alone, to his own 
              ends. The third, and greatest is, mat it depriveth a man of one 
              of the most principal instruments for action; which is trust and 
              belief. The best composition and temperature is to have openness 
              in fame and opinion; secrecy in habit; dissimulation in seasonable 
              use; and a power to feign, if there be no remedy.</p>

            <p>We will speak of nobility, first as a portion of an estate; then 
              as a condition of <br>
              particular persons. A monarchy, where there is no nobility at all, 
              is ever a pure <br>
              and absolute tyranny; as that of the Turks. For nobility attempers 
              sovereignty, and draws the eyes of me people somewhat aside from 
              the line royal. But for democracies, they need it not; and they 
              are commonly more quiet, and less subject to sedition, then where 
              there are stirps of nobles. For men\'s eyes are upon the business, 
              and not upon the persons: or if upon the persons, it is for the 
              business\' sake, as fittest, and not for flags and pedigree. </p>
            <p>We see the Switzers last well, notwithstanding their diversity 
              of religion, and of cantons. For utility is their bond, and not 
              respects. The united provinces of the Low Countries, in their government, 
              excel: for where there is an equality, the consultations are more 
              indifferent, and the payments and tributes more cheerful. A great 
              and potent nobility addeth majesty to a monarch, but diminisheth 
              power, and putteth life and spirit into the people, but presseth 
              their fortune. It is well, when nobles are not too great for sovereignty, 
              nor for justice; and yet maintained in that height, as the insolence 
              of inferiors may be broken upon them, before it come on too fast 
              upon the majesty of kings. </p>
            <p>A numerous nobility causeth poverty and inconvenience in a state: 
              for it is a surcharge of expense; and besides, it being of necessity, 
              that many of the nobility fall in time to be weak in fortune, it 
              maketh a kind of disproportion, between honour and means.</p>
            <p> As for nobility in particular persons; it is a reverend thing, 
              to see an ancient castle or building not in decay; or to see a fair 
              timber tree, sound and perfect: how much more, to behold an ancient 
              noble family, which hath stood against me waves and weathers of 
              time. </p>
            <p>For new nobility is but the act of power, but ancient nobility 
              is the act of time. Those that are first raised to nobility are 
              commonly more virtuous, but less <br>
              innocent, than their descendants: for there is rarely any rising, 
              but by a co-mixture, of good and evil arts. But it is reason the 
              memory of their virtues remain to their posterity; and their faults 
              die with themselves. </p>
            <p>Nobility of birth commonly abateth industry: and he that is not 
              industrious envieth him that is. Besides, noble persons cannot go 
              much higher, and he that standeth at a stay, when others rise, can 
              hardly avoid motions of envy. On the other side, nobility extinguished! 
              the passive envy, from others towards them;<br>
              because they are in possession of honour. Certainly kings, that 
              have able men of their nobility, shall find ease in employing them; 
              and a better slide into their business: for people naturally bend 
              to them, as born in some sort to command.</p>

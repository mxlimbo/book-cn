            <p>It is generally better to deal by speech, than by letter; and by 
              the mediation of <br>
              a third, than by a man\'s self. Letters are good, when a man would 
              draw an answer by letter back again; or when it may seem, for a 
              man\'s justification, afterwards to <br>
              produce his own letter, or where it may be danger to be interrupted, 
              or heard by pieces. <br>
            </p>
            <p>To deal in person is good, when a man\'s face breedelh regard, 
              as commonly with <br>
              inferiors; or in tender cases, where a man\'s eye, upon the countenance 
              of him with <br>
              whom he speaketh, may give him a direction, how far to go: and generally, 
              where a <br>
              man will reserve to himself liberty either to disavow, or to expound. 
              In choice of <br>
              instruments, it is better to choose men of a plainer sort, that 
              are like to do that, <br>
              that is committed to them, and to report back again faithfully the 
              success; than those, that are cunning to contrive out of other men\'s 
              business, somewhat to grace themselves; and will help the matter, 
              in report, for satisfaction sake. </p>
            <p>Use also such persons as affect the business, wherein they are 
              employed; for that quickeneth much; and such as are fit for the 
              matter, as bold men for expostulation, fair spoken men for persuasion, 
              crafty men for enquiry and observation, froward and absurd men for 
              business that doth not well bear out itself. Use also such as have 
              been lucky, and prevailed before in things wherein you have employed 
              them; for that breeds confidence, and they will strive to maintain 
              their prescription. </p>
            <p>It is better to sound a person, with whom one deals, a far off, 
              than to fall upon the point at first; except you mean to surprise 
              him by some short question. It is better dealing with men in appetite, 
              than with those that are where they would be. If a man deal with 
              another upon conditions, the start or first performance is all; 
              which a man cannot reasonably demand, except either the nature of 
              the thing be such, which must go before; or else a man can persuade 
              the other party, that he shall still need him, in some other thing; 
              or else that he be counted the honester man. </p>
            <p>All practice is to discover, or to work. Men discover themselves, 
              in trust; in passion; at unawares; and of necessity, when they would 
              have somewhat done, and <br>
              cannot find an apt pretext If you would work any man, you must either 
              know his nature, and fashions, and so lead him; or his ends, and 
              so persuade him; or his weakness, and disadvantages, and so awe 
              him; or those that have interest in him, and so govern him. </p>
            <p>In dealing with cunning persons, we must ever consider their ends, 
              to interpret <br>
              their speeches; and it is good to say little to them, and that which 
              they least look <br>
              for. In all negotiations of difficulty, a man may not look to sow 
              and reap at once; <br>
              but must prepare business, and so ripen it by degrees.</p>

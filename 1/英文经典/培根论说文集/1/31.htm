            <p>Suspicions amongst thoughts, are like bats amongst birds, they 
              ever fly by twilight <br>
              Certainly, they are to be repressed, or, at the least, well guarded: 
              for they cloud <br>
              the mind; they lose Mends; and they check with business, whereby 
              business cannot go on currently, and constantly. They dispose kings 
              to tyranny, husbands to jealousy, wise men to irresolution and melancholy. 
              They are defects, not in the heart, but in the brain; for they take 
              place in the stoutest natures: as in the example of Henry the Seventh 
              of England: there was not a more suspicious man, nor a more stout. 
            </p>
            <p>And in such a composition, they do small hurt. For commonly they 
              are not admitted, but with examination, whether they be likely or 
              no? But in fearful natures, they gain ground too fast There is nothing 
              makes a man suspect much, more than to know lime: and therefore 
              men should remedy suspicion, by procuring to know more, and not 
              to keep their suspicions in smother. What would men have? Do they 
              think, those they employ and deal with are saints? Do they not think, 
              they will have their own ends, and be truer to themselves than to 
              mem? </p>
            <p>Therefore, there is no better way to moderate suspicions, than 
              to account upon such suspicions as true, and yet to bridle them 
              as false. For so far a man ought to make use of suspicions, as to 
              provide, as if that should be true that he suspects, yet it may 
              do him no hurt. Suspicions, that the mind of itself gamers, are 
              but buzzes; but suspicions, that are artificially nourished, and 
              put into men\'s heads, by the tales, and whisperings of others, 
              have stings. </p>
            <p>Certainly, the best mean to clear the way in this same wood of 
              suspicions, is frankly to communicate them with the party that he 
              suspects: for thereby, he shall be sure to know more of the truth 
              of them, than he did before; and withal, shall make that party more 
              circumspect, not to give further cause of suspicion. But this would 
              not be done to men of base natures: for they, if they find themselves 
              once suspected, will never be true. The Italian says: sospetto licentia 
              fede: as if suspicion did give a passport to faith: but it ought 
              rather to kindle it, to discharge itself.</p>

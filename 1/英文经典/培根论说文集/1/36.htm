            <p>Ambition is like choler; which is an humour, that maketh men active, 
              earnest, full <br>
              of alacrity, and stirring, if it be not stopped. But if it be stopped, 
              and cannot <br>
              have his way, it becometh adust, and thereby malign and venomous. 
              So ambitious men, <br>
            </p>
            <p>if they find the way open for their rising, and still get forward, 
              they are rather <br>
              busy than dangerous; but if they be checked in their desires, they 
              become secretly <br>
              discontent, and look upon men and matters, with an evil eye; and 
              are best pleased, <br>
              when things go backward; which is the worst property, in a servant 
              of a prince or <br>
              state. Therefore it is good for princes, if they use ambitious men, 
              to handle it so, <br>
              as they be still progressive, and not retrograde: which because 
              it cannot be without <br>
              inconvenience, it is good not to use such natures at all. For if 
              they rise not with <br>
              their service, they will take order to make their service fall with 
              them. But since <br>
              we have said, it were good not to use men of ambitious natures, 
              except it be upon <br>
              necessity, it is fit we speak in what cases they are of necessity. 
              Good commanders <br>
              in the wars must be taken, be they never so ambitious: for me use 
              of their service <br>
              dispenseth with the rest; and to take a soldier without ambition, 
              is to pull off his <br>
              spurs. </p>
            <p>There is also great use of ambitious men, in being screens to princes, 
              in <br>
              matters of danger and envy: for no man will take that part, except 
              he be like a seeled dove, that mounts and mounts, because he cannot 
              see about him. There is use also of ambitious men, in pulling down 
              the greatness of any subject that overtops: as Tiberius used Macro 
              in the pulling down of Seianus. Since therefore they must be used, 
              in such cases, there resteth to speak how they are to be bridled, 
              that they may be less dangerous. There is less danger of them, if 
              they be of mean birth, than if they be noble: and if they be rather 
              harsh of nature, than gracious and popular: and if they be rather 
              new raised, than grown cunning, and fortified in their greatness. 
              It is counted by some a weakness in princes, to have favourites: 
              but it is, of all others, the best remedy against ambitious great-ones. 
              For when the way of pleasuring and displeasuring lieth by the favourite, 
              it is impossible any other should be over- great. Another means 
              to curb them, is to balance them by others as proud as they. But 
              then, there must be some middle counsellors, to keep things steady: 
              for without that ballast, the ship will roll too much. At the least, 
              a prince may animate and inure some meaner persons, to be, as it 
              were, scourges to ambitious men. </p>
            <p>As for the having of them obnoxious to ruin, if they be of fearful 
              natures, it may do well: but if they be stout, and daring, it may 
              precipitate their designs, and prove dangerous. <br>
            </p>
            <p>As for the pulling of them down, if the affairs require it, and 
              that it may not be <br>
              done with safety suddenly, the only way is the interchange continually 
              of favours, <br>
              and disgraces; whereby they may not know what to expect; and be, 
              as it were, in a wood. Of ambitions, it is less harmful, the ambition 
              to prevail in great things, than that other, to appear in everything; 
              for that breeds confusion, and mars business. </p>
            <p>But yet, it is less danger to have an ambitious man stirring in 
              business, than great in dependencies. He that seeketh to be eminent 
              amongst able men, <br>
              hath a great task; but that is ever good for the public. But he 
              that plots to be the <br>
              only figure amongst ciphers, is the decay of an whole age. Honour 
              hath three things <br>
              in it: the vantage ground to do good: the approach to kings, and 
              principal persons: and the raising of a man\'s own fortunes. <br>
            </p>
            <p>He that hath the best of these intentions, when he aspireth, is 
              an honest man: and <br>
              that prince that can discern of these intentions in another that 
              aspireth, is a wise <br>
              prince. Generally, let princes and states choose such ministers, 
              as are more sensible of duty, than of rising; and such as love business 
              rather upon conscience, than upon bravery: and let them discern 
              a busy nature, from a willing mind.</p>

            <p>Men in great place, are thrice servants: servants of the sovereign 
              or state; servants of fame; and servants of business. So as they 
              have no freedom; neither in their persons; nor in their actions; 
              nor in their times. It is a strange desire, to seek power, and to 
              lose liberty; or to seek power over others, and to lose power over 
              a man\'s self. </p>
            <p>The rising unto place is laborious; and by pains men come to greater 
              pains;<br>
              and it is sometimes base; and by indignities, men come to dignities. 
              The standing <br>
              is slippery, and the regress is either a downfall, or at least an 
              eclipse, which is <br>
              a melancholy thing. Cum non sis, qui fueris, non esse,cur\&quot;velis 
              vivere. Nay, retire men cannot, when they would; neither will they, 
              when it were reason: but are impatient of privateness, even in age, 
              and sickness, which require the shadow: like old townsmen, that 
              will be still sitting at their street door, though thereby they 
              offer age to scorn. Certainly great persons had need to borrow other 
              men\'s opinions, to think themselves happy; for if they judge by 
              their own feeling, they cannot find it: but if they think with themselves, 
              what other men think of them, and that other men would fain be as 
              they are, then they are happy, as it were by report; when perhaps 
              they find the contrary within. For they are the first that find 
              their own griefs; though they be the last that find their own faults. 
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, men in great fortunes are strangers to themselves, and 
              while they are in the pulse of business, they have no time to tend 
              their health, either of body, or mind. Illi mars gravis incubat, 
              qui notus nimis omnibus, ignotus moritur sibi. In place, there is 
              licence to do good, and evil; whereof the latter is a curse; for 
              in evil, the best condition is, not to will; the second, not to 
              can. But power to do good, is the true and lawful end of aspiring. 
            </p>
            <p>For good thoughts (though God accept them), yet towards men, are 
              little better then good dreams; except they be put in act; and that 
              cannot be without power, and place; as the vantage, and commanding 
              ground. Merit, and good works, is the end of man\'s motion; and 
              conscience of the same is the accomplishment of man\'s rest For 
              if a man can be partaker of God\'s theatre, he shall likewise be 
              partaker of God\'s rest Et conversus Deus, ut aspiceret opera quae 
              fecerunt manus suae, vidit quod omnia essent bona nimis; and then 
              the Sabbath. In the discharge of thy place, set before thee the 
              best examples; for imitation is a globe of precepts. And after a 
              time, set before thee thine own example; and examine thy self strictly, 
              whether thou didst not best at first Neglect not also the examples 
              of those that have carried themselves ill in the same place: not 
              to set off thy self, by taxing their memory; but to direct thy self, 
              what to avoid. Reform therefore, without bravery, or scandal, of 
              former times, and persons; but yet set it down to thyself, as well 
              to create good precedents, as to follow them. </p>
            <p>Reduce things to the first institution, and observe wherein, and 
              how, they have degenerate; but yet ask counsel of both times; of 
              the ancient time, what is best; and of the latter time, what is 
              fittest Seek to make thy course regular; that men may know beforehand 
              what they may expect: but be not too positive, and peremptory; and 
              express thyself well, when thou digresses! from thy rule. Preserve 
              the right of thy place; but stir not questions of jurisdiction: 
              and rather assume thy right in silence and de facto, than voice 
              it with claims and challenges. Preserve likewise, the rights of 
              inferior places; and think it more honour to direct in chief, than 
              to be busy in all. Embrace and invite helps, and advices, touching 
              the execution of thy place; and do not drive away such as bring 
              thee information, as meddlers; but accept of them in good part. 
            </p>
            <p>The vices of authority are chiefly four: delays; corruption; roughness; 
              and facility. For delays; give easy access; keep times appointed; 
              go through with that which is in hand; and interlace not business, 
              but of necessity. For corruption; do not only bind thine own hands, 
              or thy servants\' hands, from taking; but bind the hands of suitors 
              also from offering. For integrity used doth the one; but integrity 
              professed, and with a manifest detestation of bribery, doth the 
              other. And avoid not only the fault, but the suspicion. Whosoever 
              is found variable, and changeth manifestly, without manifest cause, 
              giveth suspicion of corruption. </p>
            <p>Therefore, always, when thou changes! thine opinion, or course, 
              profess <br>
              it plainly, and declare it, together with the reasons that move 
              thee to change; and <br>
              do not think to steal it A servant, or a favourite, if he be inward, 
              and no other <br>
              apparent cause of esteem, is commonly thought but a by-way, to close 
              corruption. For roughness; it is a needless cause of discontent: 
              severity hreedeth fear, but roughness hreedeth hate. Even reproofs 
              from authority ought to be grave, and not taunting. As for facility; 
              it is worse then bribery. For bribes come but now and then; but 
              if importunity or idle respects lead a man, he shall never be without 
              As Solomon saith; to respect persons is not good; for such a man 
              will transgress for a peace of bread. </p>
            <p>It is most true, that was anciently spoken; A place sheweth the 
              man: and it showeth some to the better, and some to the worse: omnium 
              consensu, capax imperii, nisi imperasset; saith Tacitus of Galba: 
              but of Vespasian he saith; solus imperantium Vespasianus mutatus 
              in melius. Though the one was meant of sufficiency, the other of 
              manners, and affection. It is an assured sign of a worthy and generous 
              spirit, whom honour amends. For honour is, or should be, the place 
              of virtue: and as in nature things move violently to their place, 
              and calmly in their place: so virtue in ambition is violent, in 
              authority settled and calm. </p>
            <p>All rising to great place is by a winding stair: and if there be 
              factions, it is good to side a man\'s self, whilst he is in the 
              rising; and to balance himself, when he is placed. Use me memory 
              of thy predecessor fairly, and tenderly; for if thou dost not, it 
              is a debt will sure be paid, when thou art gone. If thou have colleagues, 
              respect them, and rather call them, when they look not for it, than 
              exclude them, when they have reason to look to be called. Be not 
              too sensible, or too remembering, of my place in conversation and 
              private answers to suitors; but let it rather be said; When he sits 
              in place, he is another man.</p>

            <p align="center" class="h">25 Of Dispatch 
            <p>Affected dispatch is one of the most dangerous things to business 
              that can be. It <br>
              is like that, which the physicians call predigestion, or hasty digestion; 
              which is <br>
              sure to fill the body full of crudities, and secret seeds of diseases. 
              Therefore, <br>
              measure not dispatch by the times of sitting, but by the advancement 
              of the business. <br>
            </p>
            <p>And as in races, it is not the large stride, or high lift, that 
              makes the speed: so <br>
              in business, the keeping close to the matter, and not taking of 
              it too much at once, procureth dispatch. It is the care of some, 
              only to come off speedily for the time; or to contrive some false 
              periods of business, because they may seem men of dispatch. <br>
            </p>
            <p>But it is one thing, to abbreviate by contracting, another by cutting 
              off: and business so handled at several sittings or meetings, goeth 
              commonly backward and forward, in an unsteady manner. I knew a wise 
              man, that had it for a by-word, when he saw men hasten to a conclusion; 
              Stay a little, that we may make an end the sooner.<br>
            </p>
            <p>On the other side, true dispatch is a rich thing. For time is the 
              measure of business, as money is of wares: and business is bought 
              at a dear hand, where there is small dispatch. The Spartans, and 
              Spaniards, have been noted to be of small dispatch; Mi venga la 
              muerta de Spagna;<br>
            </p>
            <p>Let my death come from Spain; for then it will be sure to be long 
              in coming.<br>
              Give good hearing to those that give the first information in business; 
              and rather <br>
              direct them in the beginning, than interrupt them in the continuance 
              of their speeches: for he that is put out of his own order, will 
              go forward and backward, and be more tedious while he waits upon 
              his memory, than he could have been, if he had gone on in his own 
              course. </p>
            <p>But sometimes it is seen, that the moderator is more troublesome 
              than the actor. Iterations are commonly loss of time: but there 
              is no such gain of time, as to iterate often the state of the question: 
              for it chaselh away many a frivolous speech, as it is coming forth. 
              Long and curious speeches are as fit for dispatch, as a robe or 
              mantle with a long train, is for race. Prefaces, and passages, and 
              excusations, and other speeches of reference to the person, are 
              great wastes of <br>
              time; and though they seem to proceed of modesty, they are bravery. 
              Yet beware of being too material, when there is any impediment or 
              obstruction in men\'s wills; for pre-occupation of mind ever requireth 
              preface of speech;<br>
              like a fomentation to make the unguent enter.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Above all things, order, and distribution, and singling out of 
              parts, is me life of <br>
              dispatch; so as the distribution be not too subtle: for he mat doth 
              not divide will <br>
              never enter well into business; and he that divideth too much will 
              never come out <br>
              of it clearly. To choose time is to save time; and an unseasonable 
              motion is but beating the air.</p>
            <p> There be three parts of business: the preparation; the debate, 
              or examination; <br>
              and the perfection. Whereof, if you look for dispatch, let the middle 
              only be the <br>
              work of many, and the first and last the work of few. The proceeding 
              upon somewhat conceived in writing, doth for the most part facilitate 
              dispatch: for though it should be wholly rejected, yet that negative 
              is more pregnant of direction than an indefinite; as ashes are more 
              generative than dust</p>

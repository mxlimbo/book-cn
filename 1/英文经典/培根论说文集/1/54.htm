            <p>It was prettily devised of Aesop; the fly sat upon the axle-tree 
              of the chariot wheel, <br>
              and said. What a dust do I raise?</p>
            <p> So are there some vain persons, that whatsoever goeth alone, or 
              moveth upon greater means, if they have never so little hand in 
              it, they think it is they that carry it They that are glorious, 
              must needs be factious; for all bravery stands upon comparisons. 
              They must needs be violent, to make good their own vaunts. Neither 
              can they be secret, and therefore not effectual; but according to 
              die French proverb; beaucoup de bruit, peu de fruit: much bruit, 
              little fruit Yet certainly there is use of this quality, in civil 
              affairs. </p>
            <p>Where there is an opinion, and fame to be created, either of virtue, 
              or greatness, these men are good trumpeters. Again, as Titus Livius 
              noteth, in the case of Antiochus, and the Aetolians; there are sometimes 
              great effects of cross lies; as if a man that negotiates between 
              two princes, to draw them to join in a war against the third, doth 
              extol the forces of either of them above measure, the one to the 
              other: and sometimes, he that deals between man and man, raiseth 
              his own credit with both by pretending greater interest than he 
              hath in either. And in these, and the like kinds, it often falls 
              out that somewhat is produced of nothing: for lies are sufficient 
              to breed opinion, and opinion brings on substance. In military commanders 
              and soldiers, vainglory is an essential point; for as iron sharpens 
              iron, so by glory one courage sharpeneth another. In cases of great 
              enterprise, upon charge and adventure, a composition of glorious 
              natures doth put life into business; and those mat are of solid 
              and sober natures have more of the ballast, than of the sail. In 
              fame of learning, the flight will be slow, without some feathers 
              of ostentation. Qui de contenmenda gloria libros scribunt, nomen 
              suum inscribunt. Socrates, Aristotle, Galen, were men firil of ostentation. 
            </p>
            <p>Certainly vainglory helpeth to perpetuate a man\'s memory; and 
              virtue was never so beholding to human nature, as it received his 
              due at the second hand. Neither had the fame of Cicero, Seneca, 
              Plinius Secundus, borne her age so well, if it had not been joined 
              with some vanity in themselves: like unto varnish, that makes sealings 
              not only shine, but last But all this while, when I speak of vainglory, 
              I mean not of that property, that Tacitus doth attribute to Mucianus; 
              omnium, quae cHxerat jeceratque, arte quadam ostentator: for that 
              proceeds not of vanity, but of natural magnanimity, and discretion: 
              and in some persons is not only comely, but gracious. </p>
            <p>For excusations, cessions, modesty itself well governed, are but 
              arts of ostentation. And amongst those arts there is none better, 
              than that which Plinius Secundus speaketh of; which is to be liberal 
              of praise and commendation to others, in that wherein a man\'s self 
              hath any perfection. For saith Pliny very wittily; In commending 
              another, you do your self right; for he that you commend, is either 
              superior to you, in that you commend, or inferior. <br>
            </p>
            <p>If he be inferior, if he be to be commended, you much more; if 
              he be superior, if <br>
              he be not to be commended, you much less. Glorious men are the scorn 
              of wise men; the admiration of fools; the idols of parasites; and 
              the slaves of their own vaunts.</p>

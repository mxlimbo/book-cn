              PART 13</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Dejected, Lt. Kellaway heads up the steps with Sgt. Doyle.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              I still can't believe it.<br>
              Hardened cops dancin' in the<br>
              streets&iexcl;&shy; and broadcast all over<br>
              the ten o'clock news.</p>
            <p>DOYLE<br>
              The SWAT team got an offer to open<br>
              for Wayne Newton.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              I'm history. The Captain is going<br>
              to have my badge for breakfast.<br>
              With a little pension on top.</p>
            <p>DOYLE<br>
              Come on Lieutenant, it wasn't your<br>
              fault. Something will turn up.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              Sure. Stanley Ipkiss is going<br>
              to fall right into my lap&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>A car SCREECHES BY. The door flies open and a BODY comes tumbling 
              out - knocking Kellaway down. He looks up at the body sitting in 
              his lap -</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              Ipkiss!</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I can explain everything&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>DOYLE<br>
              Don't bother.</p>
            <p>Doyle pulls a GREEN RUBBER MASK out of Stanley's pocket. Kellaway 
              starts hauling him up the precinct steps.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              You have the right to remain<br>
              silent, you freakin' Looney Tune.<br>
              Anymore of your half-baked<br>
              wisecracks can and will be used<br>
              against you by me, personally&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              You've got to listen to me!</p>
            <p>Kellaway and Doyle drag Stanley into the precinct - just as MILO 
              charges up. But the dog is shut out of the station.</p>
            <p>INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Bruised, beaten and exhuasted - Stanley's thrown into a small cell. 
              The KEY-GUARD locks the cell up - then walks away.</p>
            <p>Stanley looks around his dismal quarters. A filthy toilet. The 
              cot even worse. There's a YOWLING. He climbs up on the cot and looks 
              out the small, barred window.</p>
            <p>STANLEY'S P.O.V.:</p>
            <p>There is a dumpster below the window, overflowing with trash. Next 
              to the trash heap - is MILO. The dog looks up at Stanley and YIPS 
              happily. Stanley forces a smile.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Go find yourself a new home, Milo.<br>
              It looks like I'm going to be here<br>
              for a long long time&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>Milo watches Stanley recede back into the cell.</p>
            <p>INT. JAIL CELL - DAWN</p>
            <p>Stanley lies on his cot - staring at the ceiling. The Guard bangs 
              on the door.</p>
            <p>GUARD<br>
              Wake up. You gotta visitor.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              About time you found me a<br>
              lawyer&iexcl;&shy;<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              Tina?</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Hello, Stanley.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              What's wrong? Your boyfriend kick<br>
              you out for not delivering me on<br>
              schedule?</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Is that what you think - that<br>
              I set you up?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I don't know. But I've got plenty<br>
              of time to figure it out.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              You're just going to have to trust<br>
              me on this.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Now is not the best time for<br>
              me on trusting women.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              I ran out on Dorian last night,<br>
              Stanley. I just came to tell you<br>
              I'm sorry. Sorry about<br>
              everything.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              You ran out on him?</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              That magic mask of yours turned<br>
              him into some kind of monster&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              He wasn't exactly Mother Theresa<br>
              in the first place.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              He is going to the casino opening<br>
              tonight and he is planning to do<br>
              something terrible.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              A real change of pace for him.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Half this town will be there<br>
              Stanley. I tried to tell the<br>
              cops, but they wouldn't listen<br>
              to me.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              As long as he's got the mask,<br>
              there is nothing they can do to<br>
              stop him anyway. There is nothing<br>
              anyone can do.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              There must be some way. How does<br>
              it work?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (pauses)<br>
              It's like it brings you innermost<br>
              desires to life. If deep down<br>
              inside you're a little repressed<br>
              and&iexcl;&shy; a hopeless romantic, you<br>
              become sort of a love-crazy wild<br>
              man.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              And if you've got a black heart?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Then the world's going to be a<br>
              very dark place. And if I were<br>
              you, I'd get out of town. Fast.</p>
            <p>Tina takes a beat and absorbs this information.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Thanks.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              For what?</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Lots of things. For really<br>
              believing in me when I couldn't.<br>
              For sharing a sunset with me.<br>
              For being the first guy to treat<br>
              me like I was a person instead<br>
              of a slab of meat.<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              And for being any kind of<br>
              romantic. Even a hopeless one.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (softening)<br>
              You're welcome.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              You know, that night at the club<br>
              I knew I met someone special.<br>
              Someone like nobody I'd ever met<br>
              before.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              The Mask.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              No&iexcl;&shy; the guy that was inside the Mask<br>
              all the time. You. Stanley Ip -</p>
            <p>They draw closer. The iron bars scrunch up their faces&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>TINA (CONT.)<br>
              --kiss.</p>
            <p>They KISS. A sweet, soft and romantic kiss. Then&iexcl;&shy; the 
              KEY-GUARD pulls her away.</p>
            <p>KEY-GUARD<br>
              Time&#146;s up, lady.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              I&#146;ve got to disappear for awhile<br>
              Stanley. I&#146;m not sure where I&#146;ll<br>
              go but I&#146;ll let you know as soon<br>
              as I can.</p>
            <p>Stanley takes a long last look at Tina as she&#146;s escorted out.</p>
            <p>EXT. STATION - DAY</p>
            <p>Warily, Tina slips out of the precinct. She&#146;s about to cross 
              the street, but spots a SUSPICIOUS LIMO, engine idling. Quickly, 
              she doubles back and heads -</p>
            <p>INTO THE ALLEY</p>
            <p>Behind the station. She looks over her shoulder. No one&#146;s 
              there. Tina hurries toward the next street and -</p>
            <p>A BIG SEDAN</p>
            <p>roars up, cutting her off. She turns and runs back the way she 
              came - but freezes when THE LIMO screeches up, blocking her.</p>
            <p>Sweet Eddy and Hicks jump out of the limo. She SCREAMS.</p>
            <p>INT. STANLEY'S CELL - AT THE WINDOW - SAME TIME</p>
            <p>Stanley watches helplessly as Tina is dragged into the limo. Frantic, 
              Stanley runs to the cell door.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (to the Key-Guard)<br>
              Hey! A girl's being kidnapped<br>
              out there! Do something!</p>
            <p>THE GUARD tunrs up the volume on JEOPARDY, drowning Stanley out.</p>
            <p>EXT. DORIAN'S HOUSE - DAY</p>
            <p>A slick/modern house on the hills overlooking Edge City. Sweet 
              Eddy pulls Tina from the limo.</p>
            <p>INT. DORIAN'S HOUSE</p>
            <p>Sweet Eddy and Huey enter and push Tina roughly into the room. 
              Dorian rises to meet her.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              (sarcastically)<br>
              Baby, there you are&iexcl;&shy;<br>
              (he embraces her)<br>
              I was gettin' all worried about<br>
              you.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              I just went out for a little while<br>
              Dorian.</p>
            <p>Sweet Eddy holds up a small suitcase and an overstuffed shoulder 
              bag he got from her car.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Looks like maybe a long little<br>
              while, right baby?</p>
            <p>Dorian grabs her by the throat and SLAMS her against the wall. 
              The pictures rattle.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              You know what happened to the last<br>
              bitch that ran out on me? Do<br>
              you?!</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              (choking)<br>
              No&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Nobody else does either. Nobody<br>
              ever will.</p>
            <p>He tosses her onto the bed. She lies there gasping for breath.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Now fix yourself up, baby. And<br>
              pick out something pretty to wear<br>
              tonight.</p>
            <p>Dorian picks up the mask and admires it.</p>
            <p>DORIAN (CONT.)<br>
              We&#146;re going to make a big splash<br>
              at that opening. One this town<br>
              will never forget.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>INT. JAIL CELL - DAY</p>
            <p>Agitated, Stanley paces around the room. Stanley's eyes pop open. 
              An IDEA! He stands up, clunking his heaad on the upper bunk. Stanley 
              peers down the hall and sees</p>
            <p>THE KEY GUARD</p>
            <p>watching a TV boxing match. He's CHEWING on the leather key-chain 
              strap. There is a half eaten sausage and a wedge of cheese on the 
              desk.</p>
            <p>STANLEY</p>
            <p>climbs up on the cot and looks out the window.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (stage whisper)<br>
              Milo!</p>
            <p>EXT. THE ALLEY - SAME TIME</p>
            <p>Just a pile of trash. The dog's gone. Then&iexcl;&shy; a RUSTLE. 
              A filthy blanket moves&iexcl;&shy; and MILO emerges from it - tail 
              waggling as he sees Stanley.</p>
            <p>The little dog jumps up, helplessly trying to reach the window.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Come on, boy!</p>
            <p>Milo gets an idea. He jumps on boxes and trash bags, using them 
              as steps. He climbs higher and higher until he's reached the top 
              of the dumpster.</p>
            <p>STANLEY (CONT.)<br>
              Come on, Milo!</p>
            <p>Milo jumps from the dumpster. He almost reaches the window, but 
              falls back down again into the trash heap.</p>
            <p>The dog leaps a second time. On this jump, Stanley grabs him and 
              brings him through the bars.</p>
            <p>INT. JAIL CELL - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p>Stanley gathers Milo up in his arms. The dog licks his face and 
              YELPS joyously. Stanley muzzles him and peeks -</p>
            <p>DOWN THE HALL</p>
            <p>The Key-Guardvss SNORING in his chair. The chewed leather key-chain 
              strap is still in his MOUTH. His half-eaten sausage and cheese still 
              lies before him.</p>
            <p>STANLEY</p>
            <p>shows Milo the guard, then whispers in the dog's ear.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Keys, Milo. Get the keys!</p>
            <p>Milo cocks his head at the sound of the word KEYS. He zips out 
              through the bars.<br>

            <p>EXT. HIGH SEAS - DAY</p>
            <p>The dragonhead prow of an ancient Viking ship cuts through the 
              thick fog of the rough North Atlantic Sea.</p>

            <p>EXT. BOW OF THE SHIP - DAY</p>
            <p>Viking explorer LEIF ERICSON carefully studies his fob compass 
              as he dangles it above a parchment map. His SAILORS steal nervous 
              looks at a large, diabolical-looking IRON BOX in the hold.</p>
            <p>OLAF, a fierce, one-eyed Viking warrior approaches Ericson. NOTE: 
              Dialog is in OLD NORSE, with SUBTITLES)</p>
            <p>OLAF<br>
              Leif, let's do the deed<br>
              before another night falls. The crew's<br>
              near mutiny.</p>
            <p>Ericson draws his broadsword with a flourish.</p>
            <p>LEIF ERICSON<br>
              Know this! The first man to turn<br>
              will taste my steel in his guts.</p>
            <p>OLAF<br>
              But we've surely gone far enough.</p>
            <p>ERICSON<br>
              That accursed box must be thrown<br>
              off the edge of the world. We<br>
              will go until we can go no more&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>Suddenly there is an ear-splitting SCREECH and the entire boat 
              rocks violently as it runs aground.</p>
            <p>The LOOKOUT is thrown from his crow's nest&iexcl;&shy; and CRASHES 
              straight through the deck right in front of Ericson. His pained 
              voice floats up from the black hole.</p>
            <p>LOOKOUT<br>
              &#133;Land ho.</p>
            <p>Ericson wheels about just as the fog parts off the starboard bow.</p>
            <p>ERICSON'S P.O.V.</p>
            <p>A beautiful rustic coastline stretching off as far as the eye can 
              see.</p>

            <p>EXT. THE NEW WORLD - A HARBOR - SUNSET</p>
            <p>Olaf finishes digging a hole in the sand. He backs away, terrified, 
              as burly Vikings, led by Ericson, muscle the IRON BOX over to the 
              hole and quickly bury it. Ericson turns to an exotic-looking Eurasian 
              WITCH.</p>
            <p>ERICSON<br>
              Be quick, Witch. Let the deed<br>
              be done.</p>
            <p>The Witch unravels a scroll and recites:</p>
            <p>WITCH<br>
              Oh Loki, ancient one. Thy mischief<br>
              dwell now in waters, base and<br>
              bland. And in waves and sand thy<br>
              magic forever sleep&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>As the Witch speaks, a strong wind kicks up and a black wall of 
              clouds appears. The sky explodes in THUNDER and LIGHTNING. The men 
              look about fearfully.</p>
            <p>ERICSON (CONT.)<br>
              Back to the ship men, hurry.</p>
            <p>OLAF<br>
              Captain, you've discovered a new<br>
              world. It is your right to name it.</p>
            <p>ERICSON<br>
              Leave that to the Italians. We're<br>
              never coming back here. Never.<br>
              This land is now cursed.</p>

            <p>A caffeine-driven D.J's voice booms over the beach-goers' radios.</p>

              Yessiree, it's a four-alarm<br>
              sizzler out there today with highs<br>
              in the upper nineties and no<br>
              relief in sight. We have a third<br>
              stage smog advisory and a metro<br>
              traffic gridlock alert.<br>
              Flourocarbons are up, the Dow<br>
              Jones is down and we're expecting<br>
              another Spike Lee movie any<br>
              second. In other words folks,<br>
              it's just another bee-youtiful<br>

            <p>THE DIVER wedges his scuba knife under the corroded lock. Erie

            <p>SOMETHING (seen only in rippling shadow) explodes out of the box

            <p>CHARLIE SCHUMACHER (30's) gazes out the window from his cluttered 
              desk as the crack of THUNDER echos through the urban canyons.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Look at those clouds rollin' in,<br>
              man. Freaky weather.</p>
            <p>STANLEY IPKISS, a bright0eyed amiable young account exec pauses 
              by Charlie's desk and drops off a print-out.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Hey Charlie, can you go over these<br>
              stats? We're supposed to have<br>
              a complete report before lunch.</p>
            <p>Charlie takes one looks at the complex print-outs and tosses them 
              back.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Woah. Sorry Stanley, I just had<br>
              my weave tightened and my head<br>
              is killing me. Be a pal and take<br>
              those over to Hinkleman, will ya?</p>
            <p>MAGGIE, a cute young blonde now strolls by.</p>
            <p>MAGGIE<br>
              Hi guys. Did you have any luck<br>
              with those concert tickets<br>
              Stanley?</p>
            <p>Stanley perks up at the sight of her.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I sure did. Friday night, just<br>
              like you wanted.</p>
            <p>MAGGIE<br>
              Oh, Stanley, that's wonderful.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              What time should I pick you up?</p>
            <p>MAGGIE<br>
              Gee, I don't know. My best<br>
              girlfriend just got into town and<br>
              I know she'd love to go. Can we<br>
              get an extra ticket for her?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Well&iexcl;&shy; uh, actually it's sold<br>
              out. I was kinda lucky to get<br>
              these.</p>
            <p>MAGGIE<br>
              She's only going to be in town<br>
              a couple of days and I just can't<br>
              let her sit at home all alone.<br>
              Are you sure there isn't something<br>
              we can do?</p>
            <p>Stanley considers the situation for a moment, then pulls the tickets 
              out of his pocket.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              You know what? Here. You two<br>
              go.</p>
            <p>MAGGIE<br>
              Oh Stanley, I couldn't do that.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              No really. Go ahead. It's okay.<br>
              I hate concerts anyway. All that,<br>
              you know&iexcl;&shy; music floating around.</p>
            <p>Maggie snatches the tickets from Stanley's hand.</p>
            <p>MAGGIE<br>
              That is so sweet. Sheila's just<br>
              going to love this.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              So maybe you and I can get<br>
              together over the weekend?</p>
            <p>MAGGIE<br>
              I'm not sure what's going on, but<br>
              just give me a call. You know<br>
              I like to be spontaneous.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Oh, sure. Me too.</p>
            <p>MAGGIE<br>
              Stanley Ipkiss, you are the nicest<br>
              guy.</p>
            <p>Maggie gives him a quick air-kiss and hurries off to her teller's 
              window.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              That's it.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              What?</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              The kiss of death. As soon as<br>
              they use the &quot;N&quot; word it's all<br>
              over.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              So maybe I am a nice guy. So<br>
              what?</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              You are a rug. I am talking<br>
              astro-turf here. You're letting<br>
              these women sharpen their cleats<br>
              on you.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Hey, I'm a gentleman. If they<br>
              can't appreciate that, it's their<br>
              problem.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              You spend too much time being<br>
              &quot;nice&quot; to a girl, you'll wind up<br>
              sittin' around listening to her<br>
              complain about the son of a bitch<br>
              she really loves.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Charlie, you are a very sick<br>
              puppy.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Wake up, Stanley! These are the<br>
              nineties. We're dealing with an<br>
              entire generation of dysfunctional<br>
              love junkies. You can't romance<br>
              'em. You gotta confuse 'em. It's<br>
              the only thing that gets their<br>
              attention.<br>
              (pauses)<br>
              Let me demonstrate. You see that<br>
              girl over there?</p>
            <p>Stanley looks over at the coffee service where an attractive young 
              WOMAN is pouring herself a cup of coffee.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE (CONT.)<br>
              Hi Lisa.</p>
            <p>LISA<br>
              (forgets his name)<br>
              Oh, hi&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Charlie.</p>
            <p>LISA<br>
              That's right. Sorry.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Lisa, this may seem a little odd,<br>
              but my friend over there and I<br>
              were having this discusion and<br>
              I thought maybe you could settle<br>
              it for us.</p>
            <p>LISA<br>
              I'll help out if I can.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              (sheepishly)<br>
              Actually, I don't know&iexcl;&shy; this<br>
              is kind of a personal question.</p>
            <p>LISA<br>
              That's okay. Go ahead.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Alright. Just for the sake of<br>
              argument, if I wasn't a happily<br>
              married man&iexcl;&shy; am I the kind of<br>
              guy you'd go out with?</p>
            <p>LISA<br>
              Oh, um&iexcl;&shy; I don't know.<br>
              (pauses)<br>
              Well&iexcl;&shy; yeah. I guess I would.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Lisa, I have terrific news for<br>
              you.</p>
            <p>LISA<br>
              What?</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              I'm not married! Is this perfect<br>
              or what? Listen, there's not a<br>
              lot of women willing to come right<br>
              out like that and admit they're<br>
              attracted to a guy, but&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>Lisa SLAPS Charlie, turns on her heel, and marches off.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE (CONT.)<br>
              Jeez&iexcl;&shy; make up your mind.</p>
            <p>Stanley gives Charlie the fish eye as he returns.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Okay. Bad example. Some<br>
              of these women got so much baggage<br>
              they need an emotional sky cap.<br>

              tonight I'm gonna take you on a<br>
              love safari, deep into the darkest<br>
              heart of the urban jungle.</p>

            <p>Suddenly a resounding peal of THUNDER rings out like the crack 
              of doom. Sheets of rain pour down on the bank's windows.</p>

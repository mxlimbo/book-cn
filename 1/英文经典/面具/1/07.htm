            <p><br>
              EXT. STANLEY'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Distant sirens can be heard over the occasional sound of a gunshot. 
              It's a reasonably peaceful night in Edge City.</p>
            <p>INT. STANLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p>CAMERA SLOWLY PANS off of Tina's picture, which is now taped to 
              Stanley's dresser mirror... to Stanley himself as he tosses and 
              turns in a fitful sleep. Milo lies curled up at the foot of the 
              bed. He looks concerned over the little noises Stanley is making 
              in his sleep.</p>
            <p>CAMERA PUSHES INTO AN E.C.U. of Stanley as we</p>
            <p>DISSOLVE THROUGH INTO:</p>
            <p>STANLEY'S DREAM - a 1940s noir-style montage:</p>
            <p>Huge soft-lit faces loom over him, one dissolving into the next... 
              Tina, luminous and breathtaking speaks under heavily lidded eyes.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Or it could be two lovers.<br>
              That would be the woman on top,<br>
              of course...</p>
            <p>Charlie looms up out of the darkness.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Forget her, Stanley. Ask her what<br>
              her sign is and she'll say dollar.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dickey appears, glaring down angrily at Stanley.</p>
            <p>DICKEY<br>
              Every time you're late Ipkiss,<br>
              you're robbing this bank!</p>
            <p>The shrink from the &quot;larry King Show&quot; floats by on a 
              cloud of pipe smoke.</p>
            <p>DR. NEUMAN<br>
              We must repress our Id... our<br>
              deepest darkest desires.</p>
            <p>Finally Tina again standing beside the limo as she was that night 
              in the Monkey's Paw alley:</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Hey, are you okay.</p>
            <p>Stanley stands at the curb, but this time he's not splattered with 
              mud. He's decked out in first class Armani and looks suave as hell. 
              He looks straight into her eyes.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I am now. C'mere, baby.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              (swoons)<br>
              Oh, Stanley!</p>
            <p>She runs to his arms and they embrace in a passionate kiss. But 
              Tina suddenly pulls back and begins rapidly licking Stanley's ear... 
              which is kinda weird.</p>
            <p>E.C.U. - STANLEY</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Tina?</p>
            <p>Stanley suddenly realizes Milo is licking his ear... and he's just 
              woken up.</p>
            <p>STANLEY (CONT.)<br>
              Milo, down.</p>
            <p>He pushes Milo away, tosses back the covers and rises out of bed. 
              It's still the dead of night and Stanley is all in a huff from his 
              dream.</p>
            <p>He spots Tina's clipping on his dresser mirror and rips it off, 
              upset with himself.</p>
            <p>STANLEY (CONT.)<br>
              Stupid, stupid. She'd never...</p>
            <p>Stanley wheels about and to his complete surprise sees...</p>
            <p>THE MASK</p>
            <p>Through his bedroom window, propped up on the fourth story ledge. 
              Its leering grin seems to beckon Stanley as we begin to hear the 
              POUNDING beat of the Mask F.X. theme.</p>
            <p>STANLEY</p>
            <p>stands transfixed, staring at the moonlit face. He can almost hear 
              echos of faint whispered VOICES calling his name. A deadly siren 
              song above the pounding drums.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (softly)<br>
              No...</p>
            <p>He backs away from the window.</p>
            <p>E.C.U. - THE MASK</p>
            <p>shimmers as the WHISPERS grow louder.</p>
            <p>STANLEY</p>
            <p>takes a last look at the crumpled picture of Tina in his hand and 
              finally loses control. He bolts from the room.</p>
            <p>EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Stanley is a driven man as he makes his way out onto the narrow 
              ledge. Milo tugs at his pajama leg, but Stanley kicks him away and 
              climbs out over the ledge.</p>
            <p>THE LEDGE</p>
            <p>Stanley wavers precariously on the crumbling masonry, then catches 
              his balance. His face is bathed in sweat as he gazes at the leering 
              face. F.X. music THUNDERS in his head.</p>
            <p>THE MASK<br>
              (faint echos)<br>
              Stanley... Stanley.</p>
            <p>Stanley tries to steady himself, his eyes transfixed on his prize.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Just... one... last... time.</p>
            <p>He lurches back out and makes his way one shaky step at a time 
              towards the mask.</p>
            <p>MILO</p>
            <p>watches from the apratment window, whimpering softly.</p>
            <p>C.U. - THE LEDGE</p>
            <p>Narrow masonry begins to crumble.</p>
            <p>STANLEY</p>
            <p>carefully reaches down, his fingers just brushing the mask as he 
              teeters out over nothingness. Night traffic whizzes by down below.</p>
            <p>THE MASONRY</p>
            <p>cracks away.</p>
            <p>STANLEY</p>
            <p>SCREAMS as he begins to fall, jamming the mask to his face.</p>
            <p>INT. APARTMENT</p>
            <p>The window suddenly EXPLODES inwards as the whirling Stanley/Mask 
              tornado bursts into the room. Milo dives for cover.</p>
            <p>The tornado scorches the rug as it wheels around the room, then 
              SCREECHES to a halt, revealing the Mask in his full glory. He strikes 
              a grand entrance pose with his arms held high.</p>
            <p>MASK<br>
              (sings)<br>
              I gotta be me! I just gotta be me!</p>
            <p>He ZZZIPS into the bathroom</p>
            <p>INT. BATHROOM</p>
            <p>The Mask sticks the picture of Tina on the bathroom mirror and 
              blows her a kiss.</p>
            <p>MASK<br>
              (a'la Big Bopper)<br>
              Oooooh Bay-bee. I knoooooows what<br>
              you likah!</p>
            <p>He sprouts a couple of extra arms as he madly brushes his teeth, 
              sprays on cologne and bats himself with a powder puff all at once.</p>
            <p>He ZZZIPS into the bedroom.</p>
            <p>INT. BEDROOM</p>
            <p>The Mask stands before a full length mirror and checks himself 
              out. With a magical &quot;hands are quicker than the eye&quot; move, 
              he changes wardrobe instantly... now posing in an effete fashion 
              victim Don Johnson-style suit.</p>
            <p>MASK<br>
              The G.Q. look?... Naw.</p>
            <p>In a TWINKLING he's changed again: now in MTV Rapper-style over-sized 
              jeans and backwards baseball cap.</p>
            <p>MASK (CONT.)<br>
              501's?<br>
              (shakes his head)<br>
              For buttonheads only.</p>
            <p>He changes again in a flash... This time he's naked except for 
              his Calvin Klein underwear (his stomach muscles appear super-cut 
              washboard-style).</p>
            <p>MASK (CONT.)<br>
              Marky Mark, eat your heart out.</p>
            <p>He changes one last time and appears in a wild banana yellow zoot 
              suit complete with a snap brim fedora. That's the ticket!</p>
            <p>MASK (CONT.)<br>
              S-s-s-mokin! Now let's see...</p>
            <p>The Mask quickly searches his pockets. He pulls his pants pockets 
              inside out and a moth flutters out.</p>
            <p>MASK (CONT.)<br>
              What? Seems to be a minor cash<br>
              flow problem here! I don't like<br>
              to keep a lady waiting, but...<br>
              (points a finger in the air)<br>
              First things first!</p>
            <p>The Mask ZZZIPS out of frame.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>EXT EDGE CITY BANK - NIGHT</p>
            <p>The street is quiet and empty, except for a Dipsy Doodle Diaper 
              delivery van parked across from the bank.</p>
            <p>INT. TRUCK</p>
            <p>Crowded with Dorian's men, it's been set up as a makeshift control 
              room for the robbery. Dr. Freeze SLAPS a clip in his 9mm and looks 
              down through the van's false bottom to Sweet Eddy, who is standing 
              in an open manhole working on a bundle of underground wiring.</p>
            <p>DR. FREEZE<br>
              What's the E.T.A.?</p>
            <p>SWEET EDDY<br>
              Another five minutes.</p>
            <p>Freeze synchronizes his watch.</p>
            <p>DR. FREEZE<br>
              Counting down... now.</p>
            <p>Freeze presses a button on the side of a miniaturized headset he's 
              wearing</p>
            <p>DR. FREEZE (CONT.)<br>
              (into headset)<br>
              Lookin' good here, my man.</p>
            <p>INTERCUT - DORIAN'S OFFICE</p>
            <p>He sits at his desk, speaking into a high tech walkie talkie. In 
              the B.G. Dorian's wall-mounted video monitors display live shots 
              of the club in full swing.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Nice work, Freeze. You boy are<br>
              on your own now. I've got to make<br>
              sure I'm seen downstairs.</p>
            <p>DR. FREEZE (V.O.)<br>
              Do it, man. The Doctah is about<br>
              to operate.</p>
            <p>INT. VAN</p>
            <p>Freeze turns to his men.</p>
            <p>DR. FREEZE<br>
              Gentlemen...<br>
              (cocks his gun)<br>
              Let's do our duty and grab the<br>
              booty.</p>
            <p>The burglars gather their gear when suddenly the bank alarm starts 
              RINGING.</p>
            <p>Freeze looks down the hole to Sweet Eddy.</p>
            <p>DR. FREEZE (CONT.)<br>
              What the hell you doin', fool?</p>
            <p>SWEET EDDY<br>
              Nothing! I didn't do nothing!</p>
            <p>FREEZE<br>
              (to the others)<br>
              C'mon! You keep that motor<br>
              runnin'!</p>
            <p>EXT. BANK</p>
            <p>Freeze and company race across the street with guns drawn.</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON THE BANK DOORS</p>
            <p>Freeze and Chun Woo flatten themselves on either side of the door 
              as Burglar #4 drops to one knee and quickly picks the lock.</p>
            <p>Suddenly the glass doors EXPLODE wide open as a HUMAN WHIRLWIND 
              bursts out of the bank, shoots right past them and zig-zags up the 
              street. Twenty dollar bills slowly drift down onto the stunned robbers 
              in its wake.</p>
            <p>In an instant the whirlwind does a U-turn, zig-zag races back up 
              to them and SCREECHES to a halt. The Mask, still in his banana yellow 
              zoot suit and carrying huge sacks of money like Santa Claus, plucks 
              those stray twenties from the air, one, two, three.</p>
            <p>MASK<br>
              Sorry, fellas. Waste not want<br>
              not!</p>
            <p>And ZZZOOM, he's off again. HOOTING laughter like a maniac.</p>
            <p>Freeze pulls his gun.</p>
            <p>DR. FREEZE<br>
              Get that sucker!</p>
            <p>Two cop cars now SQUEAL around the corner, their sirens blaring 
              and ROAR up the street at the bank robbers.</p>
            <p>DR. FREEZE<br>
              Oh, shit!</p>
            <p>The robbers race back to the van, dive inside and PEEL OUT. The 
              police open fire as they roar after them in hot pursuit. Bullets 
              tear into the van, blowing out the rear windows.</p>

              PART 5</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ALLEY</p>
            <p>They come to a screeching halt as they discover Stanley/Mask dressed 
              as a carnival barker. Multicolored lights and Calliope music come 
              from out of nowhere.</p>
            <p>MASK<br>
              And for my next trick&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>Long pink and blue balloons appear in Stanley/Mask's hands and 
              he instantly goes into a frenzy of twisting and knotting them into 
              an elaborate balloon sculpture. SQUEAK. SQUEAK. SCREECH.</p>
            <p>The Death's Heads are too stunned by the severe weirdness of all 
              this to do anything but stand there and stare. (These guys were 
              no rocket scientists in the first place.)</p>
            <p>MASK (CONT.)<br>
              And viola! We have a giraffe!</p>
            <p>Sure enough, he's created a first rate balloon sculpture. He hands 
              it to the biggest, dumbest Death's Head, who grins like a little 
              kid upon receiving it.</p>
            <p>The Mask instantly goes into another flurry of motion, sculpting 
              more balloons. SCREECH POP.</p>
            <p>MASK (CONT.)<br>
              A few more twists of the wrist<br>
              and for you, Cubbie.</p>
            <p>He hands this next prize to Death's Head #3.</p>
            <p>MASK (CONT.)<br>
              A French poodle! And finally my<br>
              favorite&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>He goes into another flurry of motion.</p>
            <p>E.C.U. - BALLOON</p>
            <p>As the Mask pulls the ends of the knotted balloon, it straightens 
              out and MORPHS into&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>MASK (CONT.)<br>
              A Tommy gun!</p>
            <p>A real one! He immediately sprays the Death's Heads with hot lead. 
              RATATATATATAT!</p>
            <p>The greasy punkers dive for cover and scramble out of the alley 
              under a hail of bullets.</p>
            <p>Stanley/Mask tosses the gun aside, intoxicated with his newfound 
              powers.</p>
            <p>MASK (CONT.)<br>
              Wait a minute. This is<br>
              incredible! Why, with these<br>
              powers I could be a superhero!<br>
              I could fight crime&iexcl;&shy; Work for<br>
              world peace&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>C.U. - THE MASK</p>
            <p>MASK (CONT.)<br>
              But first!&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>EXT. RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING - NIGHT</p>
            <p>It's late, but there's still a light on inside.</p>
            <p>INT. GARAGE - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Burt and Irv, both woozy from drink, attempt to finish a card game. 
              A dozen empty beer bottles and two half eaten chili dogs adorn the 
              table.</p>
            <p>Irv takes a big bite of his chili dog and pauses to regard it like 
              a true connoisseur.</p>
            <p>IRV<br>
              Now these are serious chili dogs.</p>
            <p>BURT<br>
              I know. Here's the proof&iexcl;&shy;<br>
              (lets out a long BUUURP)<br>
              Aaah. Even tastier the second<br>
              time around.</p>
            <p>Irv leans forward and sticks out his index finger.</p>
            <p>IRV<br>
              Hey Burt, pull on my finger.</p>
            <p>BURT<br>
              No way, man.</p>
            <p>IRV<br>
              No, really. Go ahead.</p>
            <p>BURT<br>
              Irv, don't&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>Irv raises a leg anyway and rips off a nasty fart. BRAAAP!</p>
            <p>IRV<br>
              (proudly)<br>
              That, my friend is the sweet smell<br>
              of success.</p>
            <p>BURT<br>
              (shrugs)<br>
              No style. I give it a five tops.</p>
            <p>IRV<br>
              Okay, how about&iexcl;&shy; Soprano.</p>
            <p>Irv shifts his weight and hits an amazing high note. PWEEEEEP! 
              Burt is impressed in spite of himself.</p>
            <p>BURT<br>
              Fine muscle control.</p>
            <p>IRV<br>
              And now for my grand finale,<br>
              THX&iexcl;&shy; The audience is listening!</p>
            <p>Irv lets one loose in perfect sensurround.</p>
            <p>Suddenly the front door EXPLODES inward. Stanley/Mask stands there 
              SILHOUETTED like a gunfighter from a Clint Eastwood movie.</p>
            <p>Irv squints into the light, unable to make out the mysterious figure.</p>
            <p>IRV<br>
              Hey, 40 watt&iexcl;&shy; we're closed!<br>
              Nobody's here.</p>
            <p>MASK<br>
              Ah&iexcl;&shy; but you're here.</p>
            <p>Irv rises.</p>
            <p>IRV<br>
              What I mean is&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>He lets loose a sneaker to help make his point. POOOOT.</p>
            <p>IRV<br>
              Nobody's here that wants to<br>
              help you.</p>
            <p>Stanley/Mask now steps into the light.</p>
            <p>MASK<br>
              But I'm here to help you.</p>
            <p>Burt and Irv's eyes go wide as they get a better look at their 
              nemesis. Fear loosens Irv's sphincter and a last feeble bit of gas 
              escapes with a FWEEP!</p>
            <p>Stanley/Mask whirls about with a flourish and pulls two gleaming 
              mufflers from the wall.</p>
            <p>MASK<br>
              Sounds like you have a little<br>
              exhaust problem there!</p>
            <p>There's a mad gleam in his eyes as he spins the mufflers like two 
              huge pistols and SNAPS them to a halt.</p>
            <p>MASK (CONT.)<br>
              We better do a few touch ups<br>
              before you have some serious<br>
              trouble.</p>
            <p>The Mask TWIRLS out of frame like a human tornado.</p>
            <p>Camera PUSHES IN past Burt and Irv's shocked expressions into an 
              E.C.U. of the garage's bare light bulb as it JIGGLES on its wire. 
              We can't see the mayhem, but we can hear wacky/bizarre sound F.X. 
              as the Mask whirls about the garage. WHIZ! SCREECH! BANG! AHOOGA!</p>
            <p>BURT AND IRV<br>
              No!&iexcl;&shy; Wait! Eeeeeyaah!</p>
            <p>SLOW DISSOLVE TO:</p>
            <p>As that light bulb becomes the morning SUN peaking over Edge City's 
              skyline. CAMERA PULLS BACK through Stanley's bedroom window&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN</p>
            <p>Stanley slowly awakens. He grabs his head and moans, looking and 
              feeling completely hung over. Then suddenly he remembers - and jumps 
              out of bed with a start.</p>
            <p>He looks in the mirror, touching his face. It's the same old Stanley. 
              He looks at his paisley PJ's. Same old PJ's.</p>
            <p>He picks up the mask. Same old mask.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              A dream&iexcl;&shy; It was only a dream.</p>
            <p>Stanley starts to relax. There's a KNOCK at the door.</p>
            <p>INT. HALLWAY - DAWN</p>
            <p>Stanley's greeted by LT. KELLAWAY (50). This hound-dog of a cop 
              can't help but stare at Stanley's garish pajamas.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              Nice PJ's pal.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Can I help you?</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              You're Ipkiss? Stanley Ipkiss?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              That's right.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              Some kind of prowler broke in and<br>
              attacked Mrs. Peenman.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (swallows hard)<br>
              Really? I didn't hear a thing.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              Then you must be a pretty sound<br>
              sleeper, Ipkiss 'cause she<br>
              unloaded a couple rounds of 20<br>
              ott buckshot five feet from your<br>
              door.</p>
            <p>Kellaway swings Stanley's door open wider to give him a better 
              view of the damage. Mrs. Peenman stands there in the hall tearfully 
              speaking to anither OFFICER.</p>
            <p>Stanley is flabbergasted to see:</p>
            <p>QUICK CUTS</p>
            <p>C.U. - The shotgun blasts in the walls.</p>
            <p>C.U. - The pot holes left from the mallet.</p>
            <p>C.U. - The shattered remains of the wacky alarm clock.</p>
            <p>All flashbacks from last night!</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (gasps)<br>
              That's&iexcl;&shy; impossible!</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              Excuse me?</p>
            <p>Stanley quickly pulls himself together.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              That's&iexcl;&shy; a, possible. See, I<br>
              have this inner ear problem.<br>
              (wiggles a finger in his ear vigorously)<br>
              Sometimes I can't hear a thing.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              (skeptical)<br>
              Is that a fact?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              What?</p>
            <p>Kellaway leans closer to speak more loudly, but catches himself 
              and shoots Stanley a dirty look.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              Forget it.</p>
            <p>He hands Stanley his card.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY (CONT.)<br>
              Here. You remember anything<br>
              unusual about last night, anything<br>
              at all, call me.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Sure&iexcl;&shy; thanks.</p>
            <p>Stanley SLAMS the door and throws his body against it, his heart 
              pounding in his chest. Milo gives him that curious dog-head-cocked-sideways 
              look.</p>
            <p>STANLEY (CONT.)<br>
              Milo, it was real! How could it<br>
              all be&iexcl;&shy; real?</p>
            <p>Stanley suddenly notices the clock on the wall.</p>
            <p>STANLEY (CONT.)<br>
              Oh my god. I'm late!</p>
            <p>He races into the bedroom.</p>
            <p>INT. HALLWAY</p>
            <p>Kellaway is taking notes as patiently as he can from Mrs. Peenman.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              Look, Mrs. Peenman, you gotta<br>
              admit your description is pretty<br>
              tough to swallow.</p>
            <p>MRS. PEENMAN<br>
              Then you can choke on it for all<br>
              I care. I saw what I saw.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              Right.<br>
              (refers to notes)<br>
              A green head the size of a<br>
              pumpkin, purple zoot suit and<br>
              spats. That's a pretty serious<br>
              fashion risk for any<br>
              self-respecting second story man.</p>
            <p>An OFFICER now hurries up the steps all out of breath.</p>
            <p>OFFICER<br>
              Lt., we just got an emergency call<br>
              from a mechanic on 67th Street.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              What?</p>
            <p>POLICEMAN<br>
              Some kind of assault and battery.<br>
              Sound pretty bad.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              (sighs)<br>
              Alright. Dont' worry Mrs.<br>
              Peenman, we'll find this guy for<br>
              you. Officer Deluca here has a<br>
              few forms you'll have to fill out.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT</p>
            <p>Stanley rushes around the apartment, but he can't find his keys 
              anywhere. He finishes tying his tie as he searches.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Milo! Keys! Keys!</p>
            <p>INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME</p>
            <p>Milo's ears prick. He leaps up and immediately starts sniffing 
              around. He pulls a cushion off the sofa and emerges with the keys 
              just as Stanley comes out, briefcaase in hand.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Good boy.</p>
            <p>He pets his dog, takes his keys and starts out the door&iexcl;&shy; 
              but he pauses to take a last look at the mask&iexcl;&shy; It's eerie 
              black eye holes and devilish grin seem to mock him.</p>
            <p>On sudden impulse, he grabs it, hurls it out the balcony's sliding 
              glass door and exits.</p>
            <p>SLOW-MO - THE MASK</p>
            <p>Sailing end over end through the air.</p>
            <p>EXT. BUILDING</p>
            <p>As the mask flies out into the sir, a sudden wind kicks up.</p>
            <p>The mask arcs back toward the building like a boomerang and lands 
              balanced precariously on a narrow ledge. Its mocking grin seems 
              to glow with triumph.</p>

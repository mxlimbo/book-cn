            <p><br>
              INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - GARAGE - AFTERNOON</p>
            <p>Peggy parks her car in her space, locks it up and beeps on the 
              car horn.</p>
            <p>When she turns, she notices a shadowy FIGURE watching her from 
              a bark corner of the garage.</p>
            <p>She hurries down the row of parked cars, clutching her purse to 
              her side.</p>
            <p>The figure follows at a slow but relentless pace.</p>
            <p>Peggy fumbles for her keys, finally finds the correct one and enters 
              the building.</p>
            <p>INT. APARTMENT HALL</p>
            <p>Peggy is relieved as she reaches her apartment door and slips the 
              key in the lock&iexcl;&shy; but the lock is jammed.</p>
            <p>She tries and tries again&iexcl;&shy; nothing. Suddenly, a hand 
              enters frame and SLAPS an eviction notice on her door.</p>
            <p>LANDLORD<br>
              Sorry, doll. I had the locks<br>
              changed this afternoon.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              You what? You can't do that!</p>
            <p>LANDLORD<br>
              You've known we're going condo<br>
              for six months, Peggy. I can't<br>
              stall the owner a minute longer.<br>
              Either you pony up the downpayment<br>
              or you're out.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Just a couple more days, Phil.<br>
              The paper's ready to give me a<br>
              full time job.</p>
            <p>LANDLORD<br>
              I've heard that one before.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              C'mon, at least let me get a few<br>
              of my things.</p>
            <p>Phil considers this a beat, then unlocks the door for her.</p>
            <p>LANDLORD<br>
              Don't make me regret this. We<br>
              get a certified check by noon<br>
              tomorrow or a Sheriff will escort<br>
              you out of here.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Thanks Phil. You're a sweetheart.</p>
            <p>Phil exits. Peggy picks up her things when she hears an off-camera 
              &quot;Pssst.&quot; She turns.</p>
            <p>THE FIGURE</p>
            <p>stands in the shadows by the fire escape. He's got a voice that 
              sounds like he's been gargling glass.</p>
            <p>THE FIGURE<br>
              I heard you were lookin' for a<br>
              story.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Who&iexcl;&shy; Who are you?</p>
            <p>THE FIGURE<br>
              Just a guy with a little<br>
              information lookin' to make a<br>
              buck. But maybe I heard wrong.<br>
              You don't look like much of a<br>
              reporter to me.</p>
            <p>Peggy gulps back her fear, determined to live up to her job.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              You give me something worth<br>
              printing and I'll get you your<br>
              money. What's this about?</p>
            <p>FIGURE<br>
              The guy they call the Mask and<br>
              why Dorian Tyrel's willing to pay<br>
              fifty large to get him.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              How do I find this Tyrel?</p>
            <p>FIGURE<br>
              Careful, sweet meat. You break<br>
              this story and he just might find<br>
              you.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>C.U. DORIAN</p>
            <p>as he enters&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>EXT. JORGENSON'S SMORGASBORD - AFTERNOON</p>
            <p>Dorian and Sweet Eddy casually step through the front door of the 
              restaurant's ersatz chalet facade.</p>
            <p>INT. SMORGASBORD</p>
            <p>Sweet Eddy takes a position by the door as Dorian greets Artie 
              the Swede at a large oak table in the festeively decorated smorgasbord</p>
            <p>The Swede is flanked by his gunsels as he&#146;s served by a big 
              blonde waitress in a classic peasant girl costume.</p>
            <p>SWEDE<br>
              Dorian&iexcl;&shy; thanks for coming by,<br>
              kid.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              My pleasure, Swede. It's been<br>
              too long. I was worried you were<br>
              still pissed about that little<br>
              thing with Harry the Hat.</p>
            <p>SWEDE<br>
              That? It was nothing. He was<br>
              a pain in my ass anyway. Here,<br>
              sit down, sit down.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Congratulations on the new casino.</p>
            <p>SWEDE<br>
              Thanks, but it might be a little<br>
              early to celebrate. As a<br>
              matter of fact that's why I asked<br>
              you to stop by.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Is that right?</p>
            <p>SWEDE<br>
              Here&iexcl;&shy; have a little something<br>
              to eat. That's Svenska meatballs,<br>
              kid. The real thing.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Thanks.</p>
            <p>Dorian starts to eat.</p>
            <p>SWEDE<br>
              So, I tell you Dorian, it' a<br>
              terrible shame. I put all my hard<br>
              work into this beautiful casino<br>
              and what do you think? All the<br>
              sudden I got all kinda problems<br>
              with the city. Big problems.<br>
              The whole deal could fold.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Maybe I can help you out. I'm<br>
              expecting to come into a little<br>
              investment capital shortly. If<br>
              worse comes to worse and you<br>
              really need to bail out&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>SWEDE<br>
              What a sweet guy. Isn't this guy<br>
              a sweetheart? Thanks for the<br>
              offer Dorian, but I think maybe<br>
              I can solve this myself.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Is that right?</p>
            <p>SWEDE<br>
              That's right. You know that<br>
              Councilman you got in your pocket?</p>
            <p>Dorian freezes with a forkful of meatballs halfway to his mouth. 
              He notices a PINK CARNATION squashed into the gravy.</p>
            <p>SWEDE (CONT.)<br>
              Well now you've got in your<br>
              mouth. How you like that?</p>
            <p>The Swede and his men have a good laugh as Dorian spits out his 
              meatball. The Swede pulls a gun and jams it under Dorian's chin.</p>
            <p>Sweet Eddy goes for his gun, but one of the Swede's men pops up, 
              jamming a barrel to his temple.</p>
            <p>SWEDE (CONT.)<br>
              (to Dorian)<br>
              Now listen close scumbag! You<br>
              want to bw in business with me?<br>
              Okay, we're partners now. I&#146;'<br>
              takin' fifty per cent off the<br>
              Monkey's Paw. You screw with me<br>
              again and I'll send you straight<br>
              down to Hell with your scumbag<br>
              councilman. You can apologize<br>
              for eatin' him for lunch.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Sure, Swede. Take it easy.</p>
            <p>SWEDE<br>
              Good. Now get out of my sight.</p>
            <p>Dorian rises.</p>
            <p>SWEDE<br>
              Oh Dorian, here's a couple tickets<br>
              to my grand opening. Stop by.<br>
              And try to dress up nice. It's<br>
              good for business.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>

            <p>&quot;The Mask Robs Bank - Police Scour The City.&quot; It's accompanied 
              by a grainy blow-up of the Mask from the bank video.</p>
            <p>A HAND</p>
            <p>jams a quarter in the slot, opens the machine and pulls out the 
              entire stack of papers.</p>
            <p>WIDER</p>
            <p>to reveal Stanley, still looking pale and desperate as he dumps 
              the entire stack of papers in a nearby garbage can.</p>
            <p>He starts to turn away when he notices an ad on the back of the 
              paper for a book&iexcl;&shy; &quot;The Masks We Wear&quot; by Dr. 
              Arthur Neuman, the same man we saw interviewed on &quot;The Larry 
              King Show.&quot; The byline reads &quot;The Mysterious Powers of 
              the Identities Within Us.&quot;</p>
            <p>Stanley rips out the ad and hurries off down the street.</p>

            <p>Stanley paces the plush office like a caged animal while Dr. Neuman 
              sits nearby toying with his pipe.</p>
            <p>DR. NEUMAN<br>
              This is extremely unusual, Mr.<br>
              Ipkiss. Barging in without an<br>
              appointment or&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Look, you're the big expert on<br>
              masks, right? Well, I've got an<br>
              emergency here!<br>
              (his face TWITCHES)</p>
            <p>DR. NEUMAN<br>
              Try to calm yourself. Now this<br>
              woman you were telling me about,<br>
              I'm not sure I understand the<br>
              problem.</p>
            <p>STANELY<br>
              I've got a date with the girl of<br>
              my dreams, only she doesn't know<br>
              it's me&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>Stanley suddenly reaches into his briefcase and pulls out the mask.</p>
            <p>STANELY (CONT.)<br>
              It's this thing!</p>
            <p>DR. NEUMAN<br>
              (takes the mask)<br>
              Very interesting&iexcl;&shy; looks like<br>
              tenth or eleventh century<br>
              Scandinavian. Where did you get<br>
              this?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (snatches it back)<br>
              I found it&iexcl;&shy; or it found me.<br>
              I'm not sure. The problem is it's<br>
              ruining my life!</p>
            <p>DR. NEUMAN<br>
              So you believe this actually<br>
              changes you into a different<br>
              person?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Yes!<br>
              (face twitches)<br>
              It's turning me into some kind<br>
              of lunatic!<br>
              (briefly CONTORTS into a Mask expression)</p>
            <p>DR. NEUMAN<br>
              Mr. Ipkiss, please. This is just<br>
              obsessional dellusion. What you<br>
              have here is nothing more than<br>
              a piece of wood.</p>
            <p>STANELY<br>
              But your book says masks&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>DR. NEUMAN<br>
              My book uses masks as a metaphor<br>
              for our complex personalities.<br>
              The masks we must present to the<br>
              outside world&iexcl;&shy; to suppress the<br>
              id. To protect our innermost<br>
              desires.</p>
            <p>STANELY<br>
              Yeah, well this one works in<br>
              reverse.</p>
            <p>DR. NEUMAN<br>
              You're going to have to be willing<br>
              to work on this delusion or&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              It's not a delusion! Alright,<br>
              I'll prove it to you if I have<br>
              to, but I won't be responsible<br>
              for the consequences.</p>
            <p>DR. NEUMAN<br>
              Mr. Ipkiss please! There is no<br>
              such thing as a magical mask.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (holds up mask)<br>
              Last chance to hide all dangerous<br>
              objects.</p>
            <p>DR. NEUMAN<br>
              Alright then, go on. You're not<br>
              going to frighten me.</p>
            <p>Stanley takes a deep breath and shoves the mask onto his face.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Whooooooooaaaaa&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>He starts spinning around.</p>
            <p>DR. NEUMAN<br>
              Whoa, what?</p>
            <p>Stanley just stands there like an idiot. Nothing happened. He tries 
              it again. Same result.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              It didn't work?</p>
            <p>DR. NEUMAN<br>
              Does that surprise you? The mask<br>
              is nothing but a reflection of<br>
              you - the inner you.</p>
            <p>Stanley isn't listening. He's thinking out load.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              It worked last night. And the<br>
              night before. Maybe it only works<br>
              at night&iexcl;&shy; What kind of mask<br>
              did you say this was.</p>
            <p>DR. NEUMAN<br>
              Scandinavian. It looks like a<br>
              representation of Loki, the Norse<br>
              God of Mischief. He supposedly<br>
              caused so much trouble that Odin<br>
              banished him from Valhalla<br>
              forever.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (gasps)<br>
              What if he banished him&iexcl;&shy; into<br>
              a mask?</p>
            <p>DR. NEUMAN<br>
              (sighs)<br>
              I'm sorry, Mr. Ipkiss, we're out<br>
              of time.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              But what should I do about my date?</p>
            <p>DR. NEUMAN<br>
              Your date?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              You know. Tonight. The park.<br>
              Tina. Do I go as myself of the<br>
              Mask?</p>
            <p>Dr. Neuman puts an arm around Stanley and leads him to the door.</p>
            <p>DR. NEUMAN<br>
              Mr. Ipkiss, please. Haven't you<br>
              been listening to anything I've<br>
              been saying? Go as yourself.<br>
              And as the Mask.<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              Because they are the one and the same,<br>
              beautiful person</p>
            <p>Stanley sees this is a losing battle. He turns and walks out.</p>

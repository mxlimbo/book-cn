              PART 12</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. STONE WALL - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Kellaway leaps/tumbles down from the wall into some bushes and 
              scrambles to his feet. He can't believe his eyes. His cops, his 
              tac squad, his friggin' SWAT team - they're ALL in the street, dancing 
              with this crazy maniac!</p>
            <p>Stanley/Mask sidles up to a heavily armed female SWAT officer, 
              &quot;dirty dancing&quot; her across the street -</p>
            <p>STANLEY/MASK<br>
              The senoritas they sing, and how<br>
              they sling their sombreros --!<br>
              (It's very nice! So full of spiiiiice--)<br>
              (dip!)<br>
              And when they're dancing they<br>
              bring a happy ring to their<br>
              vaqueros - they sing their song,<br>
              all the day loonnnggg -</p>
            <p>Doyle crash lands beside Kellaway and starts out to join the others, 
              but Kellaway grabs him by the back of his jacket.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              You go out there and I'll blow<br>
              your brains out!</p>
            <p>Furious, Kellaway yanks open the door of an abandoned squad car, 
              pulls out a tear gas gun and fires into the air. The sharp REPORT 
              and stinging gas seems to break the spell of THE MASK. The music 
              suddenly STOPS and the high stepping cops stagger away from the 
              chorus line, looking confused.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY (CONT.)<br>
              Goddamn it! Arrest that thing!</p>
            <p>The cops - shaken back to reality - fumble for their weapons.</p>
            <p>THROUGH THE SMOKE</p>
            <p>The Mask takes off - dashing into the crowd.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY</p>
            <p>spots the Mask and races after him, calling his men.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY (CONT.)<br>
              This way!</p>
            <p>THE MASK</p>
            <p>bumps into an OLD LADY who SCREAMS at his hideousness.</p>
            <p>The Mask realizes how obvious he is. He turns away and brings his 
              arms to his head. There's a RIPPPING sound. And when he turns around, 
              the Mask has now transformed back into&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>STANLEY</p>
            <p>Carrying the mask, Stanley tries to blend in with the crowd.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY</p>
            <p>followed by a handfull of officers bears down on him.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              Halt! Halt or we'll shoot!</p>
            <p>Stanley quickly cuts down&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>A NARROW ALLEY</p>
            <p>Stanley races down the lane - cops hot on his trail. Bullets EXPLODE 
              all around him. Just as he reaches the next street&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>A CAR</p>
            <p>screeches to a halt - almost running Stanley over. The window rolls 
              down revealing&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>PEGGY BRANDT</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Stanley! Get in!</p>
            <p>Stanley jumps into the passenger seat.</p>
            <p>INT. PEGGY&#146;S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Peggy rips around the bend, easily outdistancing the cops.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Thanks. Where are we going?</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Someplace where we'll be safe.</p>
            <p>EXT. DAILY TRIBUNE BUILDING - NIGHT</p>
            <p>The streets are empty.</p>
            <p>INT. NEWS SHIPPING ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Stanley and Peggy sit on stacks of bound newspapers in the vast 
              shadowy shipping room. In the b.g., a huge machine spews out hundreds 
              of newspapers on an assembly line. Everything's mechanized: printing, 
              folding, wrapping.</p>
            <p>Peggy hands Stanley a cup of coffee. He's a complete wreck, clothes 
              disheveled, rings under his eyes.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              I saw it. I saw the whole thing.<br>
              What&#146;s happening to you, Stanley?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              It's crazy&iexcl;&shy; I 've lost all control. <br>
              When I put on this mask<br>
              I can do anything&iexcl;&shy; be anything,<br>
              but it's ruining my life.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Stanley, I don't know what's<br>
              happening to you, but I do know<br>
              this. That letter you sent my<br>
              column was from a guy with more<br>
              guts and heart than any of the<br>
              creeps I've met in Edge City.<br>
              Whatever this mask is, you don't<br>
              need it. You&iexcl;&shy; Stanley Ipkiss,<br>
              are already all you ever need to<br>
              be.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Gosh, Peggy. Do you really mean<br>
              that?</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              (pauses)<br>
              Actually&iexcl;&shy; no.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              What?</p>
            <p>We now hear a door open and footsteps.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              (rises)<br>
              What took you guys so long? I've<br>
              been vamping here for twenty<br>
              minutes.</p>
            <p>Dorian and three of his men stand there with their guns trained 
              on Stanley.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              This is him?</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              You have the fifty thou?</p>
            <p>Sweet Eddy FLICKS open a briefcase lined with cash.</p>
            <p>PEGGY (CONT.)<br>
              Right. When he puts on the mask<br>
              he becomes that green thingamajig.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (still dumbfounded)<br>
              Peggy, what are you doing?</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Sorry, Stanley. You really are<br>
              a great guy, but I just can&#146;t lose<br>
              my condo. You know how hard it<br>
              is to find an apartment in this<br>
              city.</p>
            <p>Sweet Eddy and a second thug grab Stanley and hang him over the 
              steel maw of the whirring news press.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Okay Ipkiss. Where's the money<br>
              from the heist?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              My aparment. It's in my<br>
              apartment!</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Thanks. Now I believe you have<br>
              a pressing engagement.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Hey, you said you wouldn't hurt<br>
              him!</p>
            <p>Dorian toys with the wooden mask, enjoying his control over the 
              situation.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              You're right. Easy boys. One<br>
              thing at a time. Tell me about<br>
              this mask, Ipkiss. How does it<br>
              work?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I don't know&iexcl;&shy; You just put it<br>
              on!</p>
            <p>The Mask FX theme builds, Dorian raises the mask to his face.</p>
            <p>SWEET EDDY<br>
              Better be careful, boss.</p>
            <p>With a CRACK of thunder a whirlwind of light and power swirls around 
              Dorian's figure. Unlike Stanley's transformation, Dorian's is much 
              more diabolical. He grows and changes within a nimbus of ROARING 
              light. Finally the light dies away and Dorian/Mask rises from a 
              circle of swirling smoke.</p>
            <p>C.U. DORIAN/MASK</p>
            <p>While Stanley was a zoot suited bee-bopper in hyper-drive, Dorian/Mask 
              is more like a hulking evil GENIE, fresh out of the lamp and pissed 
              at the world. His diamond earring and touches of his neuvo-gangster 
              look is still apparent, but his huge grin stretches out like a Tyrannosaurus 
              Rex's under eyes that glow green with wicked power. His voice is 
              a deep inhuman RUMBLE.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              What a rush.</p>
            <p>SWEET EDDY<br>
              Whoa, boss&iexcl;&shy; are you okay?</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              I'm better than ever, you idiot.<br>
              Now stop the presses. There'll<br>
              be a new headline tonight.</p>
            <p>Sweet Eddy stands there looking disappointed with Ipkiss still 
              held dangling above the churning presses.</p>
            <p>SWEET EDDY<br>
              But what about him?</p>
            <p>Dorian/Mask wheels about and ROARS at Sweet Eddy.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              DO AS I SAY! I have other plans<br>
              for Ipkiss. Everything's become<br>
              so clear to me now!</p>
            <p>Peggy sheepishly reaches for the suitcase.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Ah&iexcl;&shy; excuse me. If you don't<br>
              mind, I'll just take my money and<br>
              be going. You guys make<br>
              yourselves at home.</p>
            <p>Dorian/Mask slides up to Peggy threateningly.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              Must you go? What a shame. You<br>
              and I could make beautiful<br>
              headlines together.</p>
            <p>Peggy removes his arm from her shoulder.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Thanks, anyway. That wasn&#146;t part<br>
              of the deal.</p>
            <p>Peggy snatches the briefcase, but Dorian/Mask blocks her exit.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              Of course. You only want what's<br>
              coming to you, don't you?</p>
            <p>Peggy whips out a snub-nose .38 out from beneath her coat.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Back off Freakazoid. I wasn't<br>
              born yesterday.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              Ah&iexcl;&shy; But you might die today!</p>
            <p>Dorian throws the switch and the presses CHURN to life. In a flash 
              he snatches Peggy off her feet.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)<br>
              A girl like you deserves<br>
              to have her face plastered all<br>
              over page one.</p>
            <p>He tosses her into the grinding mill of steel and paper.</p>
            <p>CAMERA BOOMS DOWN as Peggy's feet disappear between the presses' 
              huge rollers and continues down, down past the whirling gears and 
              hydraulics to finally ENDFRAME on the chute where the newspapers 
              roll out on a conveyor belt.</p>
            <p>Headlines in blood red ink now read: &quot;Reporter Killed in Freak 
              Accident&quot; next to a picture of a slightly flattened-looking 
              Peggy, her mouth open in a silent scream.</p>
            <p>SWEET EDDY<br>
              What do we do with Ipkiss?</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              The police are looking for the<br>
              Mask. We shall give them the<br>
              Mask. And Eddy&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>SWEET EDDY<br>
              Yeah, Dorian?</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              Get the boys ready. The Swedes'<br>
              expecting us at the casino opening<br>
              tomorrow night. We wouldn't want<br>
              to disappoint him, would we?</p>
            <p>Dorian/Mask throws his head back and lets loose a deep BOOMING 
              LAUGH. It's unnerving even to Eddy, but he laughs nervously in response 
              and elbows the other thugs to join in.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>INT. STANLEY&#146;S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p>The door is kicked open and two of Dorian's henchmen burst into 
              the room. Milo leaps off the couch and scrables behind the curtains. 
              They yank open the closet door and start scooping the cash into 
              plastic garbage bags.</p>
            <p>EXT. STREET - CAR</p>
            <p>Stanley lies in the back seat, gagged, bound hand and foot and 
              half hidden under a blanket. A thug in the driver's seat pokes his 
              .45 under Stanley's nose.</p>
            <p>THUG<br>
              That money better be where you<br>
              said it was, Ipkiss or you can<br>
              Ipkiss your ass goodbye.</p>
            <p>He chuckles at his own little joke.</p>
            <p>INT. APARTMENT</p>
            <p>Milo peeks out from behind the curtain as the henchmen finish their 
              job. He ducks behind the curtain and looks out the window.</p>
            <p>MILO'S P.O.V.</p>
            <p>of the henchmen's car. Stanley can barely be seen peeking out the 
              car window. The henchmen pushes him back down.</p>
            <p>MILO</p>
            <p>His ears perk up. The boss is in trouble! He checks back outside 
              the curtain.</p>
            <p>THE HENCHMEN</p>
            <p>finish up and start out the door carrying the trash bags. Milo 
              races right by them, just out of sight.</p>
            <p>EXT. STREET</p>
            <p>The henchmen hop in and start the engine. As the car peels out 
              into traffic, Milo appears, valiantly racing along the sidewalk, 
              dodging pedestrians and cross-traffic to keep the car in sight.</p>

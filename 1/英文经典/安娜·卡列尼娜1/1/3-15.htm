              <p><br>
                Though Anna had obstinately and with exasperation contradicted 
                Vronsky - when he told her their position was impossible, and 
                persuaded her to lay open everything to her husband - at the bottom 
                of her heart she regarded her own position as false and dishonorable, 
                and she longed with her whole soul to change it. On the way home 
                from the races she had told her husband the truth in a moment 
                of excitement, and in spite of the agony she had suffered in doing 
                so, she was glad of it. After her husband had left her, she told 
                herself that she was glad, that now everything was made clear, 
                and at least there would be no more lying and deception. It seemed 
                to her beyond doubt that her position was now made clear forever. 
                It might be bad, this new position, but it would be clear; there 
                would be no indefiniteness or falsehood about it. The pain she 
                had caused herself and her husband in uttering those words would 
                be rewarded now by everything being made clear, she thought. That 
                evening she saw Vronsky, but she did not tell him of what had 
                passed between her and her husband, though, to make the position 
                clear, it was necessary to tell him. </p>
              <p>When she woke up next morning the first thing that rose to her 
                mind was what she had said to her husband, and those words seemed 
                to her so awful that she could not conceive now how she could 
                have brought herself to utter those strange, coarse words, and 
                could not imagine what would come of it. But the words were spoken, 
                and Alexei Alexandrovich had gone away without saying anything. 
                `I saw Vronsky and did not tell him. At the very instant he was 
                going away I would have turned him back and told him, but I changed 
                my mind, because it was strange that I had not told him the first 
                minute. Why was it I wanted to tell him and didn't?' And in answer 
                to this question a burning blush of shame spread over her face. 
                She knew what had kept her from it, she knew that she had been 
                ashamed. Her position, which had seemed to her simplified the 
                night before, suddenly struck her now as not only not simple, 
                but as absolutely hopeless. She felt terrified at the disgrace, 
                of which she had not even thought before. Directly she thought 
                of what her husband would do, the most terrible ideas came to 
                her mind. She had a vision of being turned out of the house, of 
                her shame being proclaimed to all the world. She asked herself 
                where she should go when she was turned out of the house, and 
                she could not find an answer. </p>
              <p> When she thought of Vronsky, it seemed to her that he did not 
                love her, that he was already beginning to be tired of her, that 
                she could not offer herself to him, and she felt bitter against 
                him for it. It seemed to her that the words that she had spoken 
                to her husband, and had continually repeated in her imagination, 
                she had said to everyone, and everyone had heard them. She could 
                not bring herself to look those of her own household in the face. 
                She could not bring herself to call her maid, and still less go 
                downstairs and see her son and his governess. </p>
              <p> The maid, who had been listening at her door for a long while, 
                came into her room of her own accord. Anna glanced inquiringly 
                into her face, and blushed with a scared look. The maid begged 
                her pardon for coming in, saying that she had fancied the bell 
                rang. She brought her clothes and a note. The note was from Betsy. 
                Betsy reminded her that Liza Merkalova and Baroness Stoltz were 
                coming to play croquet with her that morning with their adorers, 
                Kaluzhsky and old Stremov. `Come, if only as a study in characters. 
                I shall expect you,' she finished. </p>
              <p> Anna read the note and heaved a deep sigh. </p>
              <p> `Nothing - I need nothing,' she said to Annushka, who was rearranging 
                the bottles and brushes on the dressing table. `You may go. I'll 
                dress at once and come down. I need nothing, nothing.' </p>
              <p> Annushka went out, but Anna did not begin dressing, and sat 
                in the same position, her head and hands hanging listlessly, and 
                every now and then she shivered all over, was apparently about 
                to make some gesture, utter some word, and sank back into lifelessness 
                again. She repeated continually, `My God! my God!' But neither 
                `God' nor `my' had any meaning to her. The idea of seeking help 
                in her difficulty in religion was as remote from her as seeking 
                help from Alexei Alexandrovich himself, although she had never 
                had doubts of the faith in which she had been brought up. She 
                knew that the support of religion was possible only upon condition 
                of renouncing what made up for her the whole meaning of life. 
                She was not simply miserable, she began to feel alarm at the new 
                spiritual condition, never experienced before, in which she found 
                herself. She felt as though everything were beginning to be double 
                in her soul, just as objects sometimes appear double to overtired 
                eyes. She hardly knew at times what it was she feared, and what 
                she hoped for. Whether she feared or desired what had happened, 
                or what was going to happen, and exactly what she longed for, 
                she could not have said. </p>
              <p> `Ah, what am I doing!' she said to herself, feeling a sudden 
                thrill of pain in both sides of her head. When she came to herself, 
                she saw that she was holding her hair in both hands, each side 
                of her temples, and she was pressing them. She jumped up, and 
                began walking about. </p>
              <p> `The coffee is ready, and mademoiselle and Seriozha are waiting,' 
                said Annushka, coming back again and finding Anna in the same 
                position. </p>
              <p> `Seriozha? What about Seriozha?' Anna asked, with sudden eagerness, 
                recollecting her son's existence for the first time that morning. 
              </p>
              <p> `He's been naughty, I think,' answered Annushka with a smile. 
              </p>
              <p> `In what way?' </p>
              <p> `Some peaches were lying on the table in the corner room. I 
                think he ate one of them on the sly.' </p>
              <p> The recollection of her son suddenly roused Anna from the helpless 
                condition in which she found herself. She recalled the partly 
                sincere, though greatly exaggerated, role of the mother living 
                for her child, which she had taken up of late years, and she felt 
                with joy that in the plight in which she found herself she had 
                a dominion independent of any position she would be placed in 
                by her relations to her husband or to Vronsky. This dominion was 
                her son. In whatever position she might be placed, she could not 
                abandon her son. Her husband might put her to shame and turn her 
                out, Vronsky might grow cold to her and go on living his own life 
                apart (she thought of him again with bitterness and reproach); 
                she could not leave her son. She had an aim in life. And she must 
                act; act to secure the position of her son, so that he might not 
                be taken from her. Quickly indeed, as quickly as possible, she 
                must take action before he was taken from her. She must take her 
                son and go away. Here was the one thing she had to do now. She 
                must be calm, and get out of this insufferable position. The thought 
                of immediate action binding her to her son, of going away somewhere 
                with him, gave her this calming. </p>
              <p> She dressed quickly, went downstairs, and with resolute steps 
                walked into the drawing room, where she found, as usual, waiting 
                for her, the coffee, Seriozha, and his governess. Seriozha, all 
                in white, with his back and head bent, was standing at a table 
                under a looking glass, and with an expression of intense concentration 
                which she knew well, and in which he resembled his father, he 
                was doing something to the flowers he carried. </p>
              <p> The governess had a particularly severe expression. Seriozha 
                screamed shrilly, as he often did, `Ah, mamma!' and stopped, hesitating 
                whether to go to greet his mother and put down the flowers, or 
                to finish making the wreath and go with the flowers. </p>
              <p> The governess, after saying good morning, began a long and detailed 
                account of Seriozha's naughtiness, but Anna did not hear her; 
                she was considering whether she would take her with her or not. 
                `No, I won't take her,' she decided. `I'll go alone with my son.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, it's very wrong,' said Anna, and taking her son by the 
                shoulder she looked at him, not severely, but with a timid glance 
                that bewildered and delighted the boy, and she kissed him. `Leave 
                him to me,' she said to the astonished governess, and without 
                letting go of her son, she sat down at the table, where coffee 
                was set ready for her. </p>
              <p> `Mamma! I... I didn't...' he said, trying to make out from her 
                expression what was in store for him in regard to the peaches. 
              </p>
              <p> `Seriozha,' she said, as soon as the governess had left the 
                room, `that was wrong, but you'll never do it again, will you?... 
                You love me?' </p>
              <p> She felt that the tears were coming into her eyes. `Can I help 
                loving him?' she said to herself, looking deeply into his scared 
                and at the same time delighted eyes. `And can he ever join his 
                father in punishing me? Is it possible he will not feel for me?' 
                Tears were already flowing down her face, and to hide them she 
                got up abruptly and almost ran out on the terrace. </p>
              <p> After the thundershowers of the last few days, cold, bright 
                weather had set in. The air was cold in the bright sun that filtered 
                through the freshly washed leaves. </p>
              <p> She shivered, both from the cold and from the inward horror 
                which had clutched her with fresh force in the open air. </p>
              <p> `Run along, run along to Mariette,' she said to Seriozha, who 
                had followed her out, and she began walking up and down on the 
                straw matting of the terrace. `Can it be that they won't forgive 
                me, won't understand how it all could not have been otherwise?' 
                she said to herself. </p>
              <p> Standing still, and looking at the tops of the aspen trees waving 
                in the wind, with their freshly washed, brightly shining leaves 
                in the cold sunshine, she knew that they would not forgive her, 
                that everyone and everything would be merciless to her now as 
                was that sky, that green. And again she felt that everything was 
                doubling in her soul. `I mustn't, mustn't think,' she said to 
                herself. `I must get ready. To go where? When? Whom to take with 
                me? Yes - to Moscow, by the evening train. Annushka and Seriozha, 
                and only the most necessary things. But first I must write to 
                them both.' She went quickly indoors into her boudoir, sat down 
                at the table, and wrote to her husband: </p>
              <p> `After what has happened I cannot remain any longer in your 
                house. I am going away, and taking my son with me. I don't know 
                the law; and so I don't know with which of the parents the son 
                should remain; but I take him with me because I cannot live without 
                him. Be generous, leave him to me.' </p>
              <p> Up to this point she wrote rapidly and naturally, but the appeal 
                to his generosity, a quality she did not recognize in him, and 
                the necessity of winding up the letter with something touching, 
                pulled her up. </p>
              <p> `Of my fault and my remorse I cannot speak, because...' </p>
              <p> She stopped again, finding no connection in her ideas. `No,' 
                she said to herself, `there's no need of anything,' and tearing 
                up the letter, she wrote it again, leaving out the allusion to 
                generosity, and sealed it up. </p>
              <p> Another letter had to be written to Vronsky. `I have told my 
                husband,' she wrote, and she sat a long while unable to write 
                more. It was so coarse, so unfeminine. `And what more am I to 
                write him?' she said to herself. Again a flush of shame spread 
                over her face; she recalled his composure, and a feeling of anger 
                against him impelled her to tear the sheet with the phrase she 
                had written into tiny bits. `No need of anything,' she said to 
                herself, and closing her blotting case she went upstairs, told 
                the governess and the servants that she was going that day to 
                Moscow, and at once set to work to pack up her things. </p>

              <p><br>
                Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy 
                in its own way. <br>
                Everything was in confusion in the Oblonsky's house. The wife 
                had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with 
                a French girl, who had been a governess in their family, and she 
                had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in 
                the same house with him. This position of affairs had now lasted 
                two days, and not only the husband and wife themselves, but all 
                the members of their family and the household, were painfully 
                conscious of it. All the members of the family and the household 
                felt that there was no sense in their living together, and that 
                even stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more 
                in common with one another than they, the members of the family 
                and the household of the Oblonskys. The wife did not leave her 
                own apartments; the husband had not been home for two days. The 
                children ran wild all over the house; the English governess quarreled 
                with the housekeeper, and wrote to a friend asking her to look 
                out for a new employ for her; the man cook had walked off the 
                day before just at dinnertime; the kitchenmaid and the coachman 
                had given warning. </p>
              <p> Two days after the quarrel, Prince Stepan Arkadyevich Oblonsky 
                - Stiva, as he was called in the fashionable world - woke up at 
                his usual hour, that is, at eight o'clock in the morning, not 
                in his wife's bedroom, but on the leather-covered sofa in his 
                study. He turned over his stout, well-cared-for person on the 
                springy sofa, as though he would sink into a long sleep again; 
                he vigorously embraced the pillow on its other side and buried 
                his face in it; but all at once he jumped up, sat up on the sofa, 
                and opened his eyes. </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes, how was it now?' he thought, going over his dream. 
                `Yes, how was it? Yes! Alabin was giving a dinner at Darmstadt; 
                no, not Darmstadt, but something American. Yes, but then, Darmstadt 
                was in America. Yes, Alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables, 
                and the tables sang, Il mio tesoro - no, not Il mio tesoro, but 
                something better, and there were some sort of little decanters 
                on the table, and, at the same time, these decanters were women,' 
                he recalled. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich's eyes twinkled gaily, and he pondered with 
                a smile. `Yes, it was jolly, very jolly. There was a great deal 
                more that was delightful, only there's no putting it into words, 
                or even expressing it in one's waking thoughts.' And noticing 
                a gleam of light peeping in beside one of the woolen-cloth curtains, 
                he cheerfully dropped his feet over the edge of the sofa and felt 
                about with them for his slippers, a present on his last birthday, 
                worked for him by his wife on gold-colored morocco. And, as he 
                used to do for the last nine years, he stretched out his hand, 
                without getting up, toward the place where his dressing gown always 
                hung in the bedroom. And thereupon he suddenly remembered that 
                he was not sleeping in his wife's room, but in his study, as well 
                as the reason; the smile vanished from his face and he knit his 
                brows. </p>
              <p> `Ah, ah, ah! Oo!...' he muttered, recalling everything that 
                had happened. And again every detail of his quarrel with his wife 
                was present to his imagination, all the hopelessness of his position, 
                and, worst of all, his own fault. </p>
              <p> `Yes, she won't forgive me, and she can't forgive me. And the 
                most awful thing about it is that it's all my fault - all my fault, 
                though I'm not to blame. That's the point of the whole tragedy,' 
                he reflected. `Oh, oh, oh!' he kept repeating in despair, as he 
                remembered the acutely painful sensations caused him by this quarrel. 
              </p>
              <p> Most unpleasant of all was the first minute when, on coming 
                from the theater, good-humored and lighthearted, with a huge pear 
                in his hand for his wife, he had not found his wife in the drawing 
                room, to his surprise, nor in the study, but saw her at last in 
                her bedroom, clutching the unlucky letter that revealed everything. 
              </p>
              <p> She, his Dolly, forever fussing and worrying over household 
                details, and limited in her ideas, as he considered, was sitting 
                motionless with the letter in her hand, looking at him with an 
                expression of horror, despair and indignation. </p>
              <p> `What is this? This?' she asked, pointing to the letter. </p>
              <p> And at this recollection, Stepan Arkadyevich, as is so often 
                the case, was not so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the 
                way in which he had met his wife's words. </p>
              <p> There happened to him at that instant that which happens to 
                people when they are unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful. 
                He did not succeed in adapting his face to the situation in which 
                he was placed toward his wife by the discovery of his fault. Instead 
                of being hurt, denying, defending himself, begging forgiveness; 
                instead of remaining indifferent even - anything would have been 
                better than what he did do - his face utterly without his volition 
                (`cerebral reflexes,' mused Stepan Arkadyevich, who was fond of 
                physiology) had assumed its habitual good-humored, and therefore 
                stupid, smile. </p>
              <p> This stupid smile he could not forgive himself. Catching sight 
                of that smile Dolly shuddered as though from physical pain, broke 
                out with her characteristic heat into a flood of cruel words, 
                and rushed out of the room. Since then she had refused to see 
                her husband. </p>
              <p> `It's all the fault of that stupid smile,' Stepan Arkadyevich 
                was thinking. </p>
              <p> `But what's to be done? What's to be done?' he kept saying to 
                himself in despair - and found no answer. </p>

              <p><br>
                In the Surovsky district there was neither railway nor mail coach, 
                and Levin drove there with his own horses in his tarantass. </p>
              <p>He stopped halfway at a well-to-do peasant's to feed his horses. 
                A bald, well-preserved old man, with a broad, red beard, grizzled 
                on his cheeks, opened the gate, squeezing against the gatepost 
                to let the troika pass. Directing the coachman to a place under 
                the shed in the big, clean, tidy new yard, with charred, wooden 
                plows in it, the old man asked Levin to come into the room. A 
                cleanly dressed young housewife, with clogs on her bare feet, 
                was scrubbing the floor in the new outer room. She was frightened 
                by the dog that ran in after Levin, and uttered a shriek, but 
                began laughing at her own fright at once when she was told the 
                dog would not hurt her. Pointing out to Levin with her bare arm 
                the door into the room, she bent down again, hiding her handsome 
                face, and went on scrubbing. </p>
              <p> `Would you like a samovar?' she asked. </p>
              <p> `Yes, please.' </p>
              <p> The room was a big one, with a tile stove, and a partition dividing 
                it into two. Under the icons stood a table painted in patterns, 
                a bench and two chairs. Near the entrance was a dresser full of 
                crockery. The shutters were closed, there were few flies, and 
                it was so clean that Levin was anxious that Laska, who had been 
                running along the road and bathing in puddles, should not muddy 
                the floor, and ordered her to a place in the corner by the door. 
                After looking round the room, Levin went out in the back yard. 
                The comely young housewife in clogs, swinging the empty pails 
                on the yoke, ran on before him to the well for water. </p>
              <p> `Look sharp, my girl!' the old man shouted after her, good-humoredly, 
                and he walked up to Levin. `Well, sir, are you going to Nikolai 
                Ivanovich Sviiazhsky? He comes to us too,' he began chatting, 
                leaning his elbows on the railing of the steps. In the middle 
                of the old man's account of his acquaintance with Sviiazhsky, 
                the gates creaked again, and laborers came into the yard from 
                the fields, with wooden plows and harrows. The horses harnessed 
                to the plows and harrows were sleek and fat. The laborers were 
                obviously of the household: two were young men in cotton-print 
                shirts and caps, the two others were hired laborers in homespun 
                shirts, one an old man, the other a young fellow. </p>
              <p> Moving off from the steps, the old man went up to the horses 
                and began unharnessing them. </p>
              <p> `What have they been plowing?' asked Levin. </p>
              <p> `Plowing up the potatoes. We rent a bit of land too. Fedot, 
                don't let out the gelding, but take it to the trough, and we'll 
                put another in harness.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, father, about the plowshares I ordered - has he brought 
                them along?' asked the big, robust fellow, obviously the old man's 
                son. </p>
              <p> `There... in the sledge,' answered the old man, rolling up the 
                reins he had taken off, and flinging them on the ground. `You 
                can put them right, while they have dinner.' </p>
              <p> The comely young housewife came into the outer room with the 
                full pails dragging at her shoulders. More women came on the scene 
                from somewhere, young and handsome, middle-aged, old and ugly, 
                with children and without children. </p>
              <p> The samovar was beginning to sing; the laborers and the family, 
                having disposed of the horses, came in to dinner. Levin, getting 
                his provisions out of his carriage, invited the old man to take 
                tea with him. </p>
              <p> `Well, I have had some today already,' said the old man, obviously 
                accepting the invitation with pleasure. `Well, be it so, for company.' 
              </p>
              <p> Over their tea Levin heard all about the old man's farming. 
                Ten years before the old man had rented a hundred and twenty dessiatinas 
                from the lady who owned them, and a year ago he had bought them 
                and rented another three hundred from a neighboring landowner. 
                A small part of the land - the worst part - he let out for rent, 
                while some forty dessiatinas of arable land he cultivated himself, 
                with his family and two hired laborers. The old man complained 
                that things were going badly. But Levin saw that he simply did 
                so from a feeling of propriety, and that his farm was in a flourishing 
                condition. If it had been unsuccessful he would not have bought 
                land at a hundred and five roubles the dessiatina, he would not 
                have married off his three sons and a nephew, he would not have 
                rebuilt twice after fires, and each time on a larger scale. In 
                spite of the old man's complaints, it was evident that he was 
                proud, and justly proud, of his prosperity, proud of his sons, 
                his nephew, his sons' wives, his horses, and his cows, and especially 
                of the fact that he was keeping all this farming going. From his 
                conversation with the old man, Levin realized he was not averse 
                to new methods either. He had planted a great many potatoes, and 
                his potatoes, as Levin had seen driving past, were already past 
                flowering and beginning to ripen, whereas Levin's were only just 
                coming into flower. He plowed the ground for his potatoes with 
                a modern plow borrowed from a neighboring landowner. He sowed 
                wheat. The trifling fact that, thinning out his rye, the old man 
                used the rye he thinned out for his horses, struck Levin especially. 
                How many times had Levin seen this splendid fodder wasted, and 
                tried to get it saved; but always it had turned out to be impossible. 
                This peasant had done so, and he could not say enough in praise 
                of it as food for the beasts. </p>
              <p> `What have the wenches to do? They carry it out in bundles to 
                the roadside, and the cart brings it away.' </p>
              <p> `Well, we landowners can't manage well with our laborers,' said 
                Levin, handing him a glass of tea. </p>
              <p> `Thanks,' said the old man, and he took the glass, but refused 
                sugar, pointing to a bit he had left. `There's no getting along 
                with them,' said he. `They're simple waste. Look at Sviiazhsky, 
                for instance. We know what the land's like - first-rate; yet there's 
                not much of a crop to boast of. It's not looked after enough - 
                that's all it is!' </p>
              <p> `But you work your land with hired laborers?' </p>
              <p> `We're all peasants together. We go into everything ourselves. 
                If a man's no use, he can go, and we can manage by ourselves.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Father Finogen wants some tar,' said the young woman in the 
                clogs, coming in. </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes, that's how it is, sir!' said the old man, getting 
                up, and, crossing himself lingeringly, he thanked Levin and went 
                out. </p>
              <p> When Levin went in the kitchen to call his coachman he saw the 
                whole family of men at dinner. The women were standing up waiting 
                on them. The young, robust son was telling something funny, with 
                his mouth full of buckwheat porridge, and they were all laughing 
                - the woman in the clogs, who was pouring cabbage soup into a 
                bowl, laughing most merrily of all. </p>
              <p> Very probably the comely face of the young woman in the clogs 
                had a good deal to do with the impression of well-being this peasant 
                household made upon Levin, but the impression was so strong that 
                Levin could never get rid of it. And all the way from the old 
                peasant's to Sviiazhsky's he kept recalling this peasant farm 
                as though there were something in this impression demanding his 
                special attention. </p>

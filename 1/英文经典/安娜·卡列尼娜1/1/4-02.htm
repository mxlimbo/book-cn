                When he got home, Vronsky found there a note from Anna. She wrote: 
                `I am ill and unhappy. I cannot come out, yet cannot go on longer 
                without seeing you. Come in this evening. Alexei Alexandrovich 
                goes to the Council at seven and will be there till ten.' After 
                a minute's reflection on the strangeness of her bidding him come 
                straight to her, in spite of her husband's insisting on her not 
                receiving him, he decided to go. </p>
              <p>Vronsky had that winter got his promotion, was now a colonel, 
                had left the regiment, and was living alone. After having some 
                lunch, he lay down on the sofa immediately, and in five minutes 
                memories of the hideous scenes he had witnessed during the last 
                few days were jumbled and joined to a mental image of Anna and 
                of the peasant, one of the encompassing people, who had played 
                an important part in the bear hunt, and Vronsky fell asleep. He 
                waked up in the dark, trembling with horror, and made haste to 
                light a candle. `What was it? What? What was the dreadful thing 
                I dreamed? Yes, yes; the peasant bear hunter, I think; a little 
                dirty man with a disheveled beard was stooping down doing something, 
                and all of a sudden he began saying some strange words in French. 
                Yes, there was nothing else in the dream,' he said to himself. 
                `But why was it so awful?' He vividly recalled the peasant again 
                and those incomprehensible French words the peasant had uttered, 
                and a chill of horror ran down his spine. </p>
              <p> `What nonsense!' thought Vronsky, and glanced at his watch. 
              </p>
              <p> It was half-past eight already. He rang up his servant, dressed 
                in haste, and went out on the steps, completely forgetting the 
                dream and only worried at being late. As he drove up to the Karenins' 
                entrance he looked at his watch and saw it was ten minutes to 
                nine. A high, narrow carriage with a pair of grays was standing 
                at the entrance. He recognized Anna's carriage. `She is coming 
                to me,' thought Vronsky, `and better she should. I don't like 
                going into that house. But no matter; I can't hide myself,' he 
                thought, and with that manner peculiar to him from childhood, 
                as of a man who has nothing to be ashamed of, Vronsky got out 
                of his sleigh and went to the door. The door opened, and the hall 
                porter with a rug on his arm called the carriage. Vronsky, though 
                he did not usually notice details, noticed at this moment the 
                amazed expression with which the porter glanced at him. In the 
                very doorway Vronsky almost ran up against Alexei Alexandrovich. 
                The gas jet threw its full light on the bloodless, sunken face 
                under the black hat, and on the white cravat, brilliant against 
                the beaver of the coat. Karenin's fixed, dull eyes were fastened 
                upon Vronsky's face. Vronsky bowed, and Alexei Alexandrovich, 
                chewing his lips, lifted his hand to his hat and went on. Vronsky 
                saw him get into the carriage without looking back, receive the 
                rug and the opera glasses through the window, and disappear. Vronsky 
                went into the hall. His brows were scowling, and his eyes gleamed 
                with a proud and angry light in them. </p>
              <p> `What a situation!' he thought. `If he would fight, would stand 
                up for his honor, I could act, could express my feelings; but 
                this weakness or baseness... He puts me in the position of playing 
                false, which I never meant and never mean to do.' </p>
              <p> Vronsky's ideas had changed since the day of his conversation 
                with Anna in the Vrede garden. Unconsciously yielding to the weakness 
                of Anna - who had surrendered herself up to him utterly, and simply 
                looked to him to decide her fate, ready to submit to anything 
                - he had long ceased to think that their liaison might end as 
                he had thought then. His ambitious plans had retreated into the 
                background again, and feeling that he had got out of that circle 
                of activity in which everything was definite, he had given himself 
                up entirely to his passion, and that passion was binding him more 
                and more closely to her. </p>
              <p> He was still in the hall when he caught the sound of her retreating 
                footsteps. He realized she had been expecting him, had listened 
                for him, and was now going back to the drawing room. </p>
              <p> `No,' she cried, on seeing him, and at the first sound of her 
                voice the tears came into her eyes. `No; if things are to go on 
                like this, the end will come much, much too soon.' </p>
              <p> `What is it, dear one?' </p>
              <p> `What? I've been waiting in agony for an hour, two hours... 
                No, I won't... I can't quarrel with you. Of course you couldn't 
                come. No, I won't.' </p>
              <p> She laid her two hands on his shoulders, and looked a long while 
                at him with a profound, passionate, and, at the same time, searching 
                look. She was studying his face to make up for the time she had 
                not seen him. She was, every time she saw him, making the picture 
                of him in her imagination (incomparably superior, impossible in 
                reality) fit with him as he really was. </p>

              <p><br>
                On Monday there was the usual session of the Commission of the 
                2nd of June. Alexei Alexandrovich walked into the hall where the 
                session was held, greeted the members and the president, as usual, 
                and sat down in his place, putting his hand on the papers laid 
                ready before him. Among those papers lay the necessary evidence 
                and a rough outline of the speech he intended to make. But he 
                did not really need these documents. He remembered every point, 
                and did not think it necessary to go over in his memory what he 
                would say. He knew that when the time came, and when he saw his 
                enemy facing him, and studiously endeavoring to assume an expression 
                of indifference, his speech would flow of itself better than he 
                could prepare it now. He felt that the import of his speech was 
                of such magnitude that every word of it would have weight. Meantime, 
                as he listened to the usual report, he had the most innocent and 
                inoffensive air. No one, looking at his white hands, with their 
                swollen veins and long fingers, so softly stroking the edges of 
                the white paper that lay before him, and at the air of weariness 
                with which his head drooped on one side, would have suspected 
                that in a few minutes a torrent of words would flow from his lips 
                that would arouse a fearful storm, set the members shouting and 
                attacking one another, and force the president to call for order. 
                When the report was over, Alexei Alexandrovich announced in his 
                subdued, delicate voice that he had several points to bring before 
                the meeting in regard to the organization of the native tribes. 
                All attention was turned upon him. Alexei Alexandrovich cleared 
                his throat, and, without looking at his opponent, but selecting, 
                as he always did while he was delivering his speeches, the first 
                person sitting opposite him, an inoffensive little old man, who 
                never had an opinion of any sort in the Commission, began to expound 
                his views. When he reached the point about the basic and organic 
                law, his opponent jumped up and began to protest. Stremov, who 
                was also a member of the Commission, and was also stung to the 
                quick, began defending himself, and an altogether stormy session 
                followed; but Alexei Alexandrovich triumphed, and his motion was 
                carried, three new commissions were appointed, and the next day, 
                in a certain Peterburg circle, nothing else was talked of but 
                this session. Alexei Alexandrovich's success had been even greater 
                than he had anticipated. <br>
                Next morning, Tuesday, Alexei Alexandrovich, on awaking, recollected 
                with pleasure his triumph of the previous day, and he could not 
                help smiling, though he tried to appear indifferent, when the 
                head clerk, anxious to flatter him, informed him of the rumors 
                that had reached him concerning what had happened in the Commission. 
              </p>
              <p> Absorbed in business with the head clerk, Alexei Alexandrovich 
                had completely forgotten that it was Tuesday, the day fixed by 
                him for the return of Anna Arkadyevna, and he was surprised and 
                received a shock of annoyance when a servant came in to inform 
                him of her arrival. </p>
              <p> Anna had arrived in Peterburg early in the morning; the carriage 
                had been sent to meet her in accordance with her telegram, and 
                so Alexei Alexandrovich might have known of her arrival. But, 
                when she arrived, he did not meet her. She was told that he had 
                not yet gone out, but was busy with the head clerk. She sent word 
                to her husband that she had come, went to her own room, and occupied 
                herself in sorting out her things, expecting he would come to 
                her. But an hour passed; he did not come. She went into the dining 
                room on the pretext of giving some directions, and spoke loudly 
                on purpose, expecting him to come out there; but he did not come, 
                though she heard him go to the door of his study as he parted 
                from the head clerk. She knew that he should before long go out 
                to his office as usual, and she wanted to see him before that, 
                so that their attitude to one another might be defined. </p>
              <p> She walked across the drawing room and went resolutely to him. 
                When she went into his study he was in official uniform, obviously 
                ready to go out, sitting at a little table on which he rested 
                his elbows, looking dejectedly before him. She saw him before 
                he saw her, and she knew that he was thinking of her. </p>
              <p> On seeing her, he would have risen, but changed his mind, then 
                his face flushed hotly - a thing Anna had never seen before, and 
                he got up quickly and went to meet her, looking not at her eyes, 
                but above them, at her forehead and hair. He went up to her, took 
                her by the hand, and asked her to sit down. </p>
              <p> `I am very glad you have come,' he said, sitting down beside 
                her, and, obviously wishing to say something, he stuttered. Several 
                times he attempted to speak, but stopped. In spite of the fact, 
                that in preparing herself for meeting him, she had schooled herself 
                to despise and accuse him, she did not know what to say to him, 
                and she felt pity for him. And so the silence lasted rather long: 
                `Is Seriozha quite well?' he said, and, without waiting for an 
                answer, he added: `I shan't be dining at home today, and I must 
                go out directly.' </p>
              <p> `I had thought of going to Moscow,' she said. </p>
              <p> `No, you did quite, quite right to come,' he said, and was silent 
                again. </p>
              <p> Seeing that he was powerless to begin the conversation, she 
                began herself. </p>
              <p> `Alexei Alexandrovich,' she said, looking at him and without 
                dropping her eyes under his persistent gaze at her hair, `I'm 
                a guilty woman, I'm a bad woman, yet I am the same as I was, as 
                I told you then, and I have come to tell you that I can change 
                nothing.' </p>
              <p> `I haven't asked you about that,' he said, all at once, resolutely 
                and with hatred looking her straight in the face; `that was as 
                I had supposed.' Under the influence of anger he apparently regained 
                complete possession of all his faculties. `But as I told you then, 
                and have written to you,' he said in a thin, shrill voice, `I 
                repeat now, that I am not bound to know this. I ignore it. Not 
                all wives are so kind as you, to be in such a hurry to communicate 
                such agreeable news to their husbands.' He laid special emphasis 
                on the word `agreeable.' `I shall ignore it so long as the world 
                knows nothing of it, so long as my name is not disgraced. And 
                so I simply inform you that our relations must be just as they 
                have always been, and that only in the event of your compromising 
                yourself I shall be obliged to take steps to secure my honor.' 
              </p>
              <p> `But our relations cannot be the same as always,' Anna began 
                in a timid voice, looking at him with dismay. </p>
              <p> When she saw once more those composed gestures, heard that shrill, 
                childlike and sarcastic voice, her aversion for him extinguished 
                her pity for him, and she felt only afraid; but at all costs she 
                wanted to make clear her position. </p>
              <p> `I cannot be your wife while I...' she began. </p>
              <p> He laughed a cold and malignant laugh. </p>
              <p> `The manner of life you have chosen is reflected, I suppose, 
                in your ideas. I have so much of both respect and contempt - I 
                respect your past and despise your present - that I was far from 
                the interpretation you put on my words.' </p>
              <p> Anna sighed and bowed her head. </p>
              <p> `Though indeed I fail to comprehend how, with the independence 
                you show,' he went on, getting hot, `announcing your infidelity 
                to your husband and seeing nothing reprehensible in it, apparently, 
                you can see anything reprehensible in performing a wife's duties 
                in relation to your husband.' </p>
              <p> `Alexei Alexandrovich! What is it you want of me?' </p>
              <p> `I want never to meet that man here, and I want you to conduct 
                yourself so that neither society, nor the servants, could possibly 
                reproach you.... I want you not to see him. That's not much, I 
                think. And in return you will enjoy all the privileges of a faithful 
                wife without fulfilling her duties. That's all I have to say to 
                you. Now it's time for me to go. I'm not dining at home.' He got 
                up and moved toward the door. </p>
              <p> Anna got up too. Bowing in silence, he let her pass before him. 
              </p>

              <p><br>
                The streets were still empty. Levin went to the house of the Shcherbatskys. 
                The visitors' doors were closed and everything was asleep. He 
                walked back, went into his room again, and asked for coffee. The 
                day servant, not Iegor this time, brought it to him. Levin would 
                have entered into conversation with him, but a bell rang for the 
                servant, and he went out. Levin tried to drink coffee and take 
                a bite of a roll, but his mouth was quite at a loss what to do 
                with the roll. Levin, rejecting the roll, put on his coat and 
                went out again for a walk. It was nine o'clock when he reached 
                the Shcherbatskys' steps the second time. In the house they were 
                only just up, and the cook came out to go marketing. He had to 
                get through at least two hours more. </p>
              <p>All that night and morning Levin lived perfectly unconsciously, 
                and felt perfectly lifted out of the conditions of material life. 
                He had eaten nothing for a whole day, he had not slept for two 
                nights, had spent several hours undressed in the frozen air, and 
                felt not only fresher and stronger than ever, but felt utterly 
                independent of his body; he moved without muscular effort, and 
                felt as if he could do anything. He was convinced he could fly 
                upward or lift the corner of the house, if need be. He spent the 
                remainder of the time in the street, incessantly looking at his 
                watch and gazing about him. </p>
              <p> And what he saw then, he never saw again after. Especially the 
                children going to school, the blue-gray doves fluttering down 
                from the roofs to the pavement, and the little loaves covered 
                with flour, set out by an unseen hand, touched him. Those loaves, 
                those doves, and those two boys were not of this earth. It all 
                happened at the same time: a boy ran toward a dove and glanced 
                smiling at Levin; the dove, with a whir of her wings, darted away, 
                flashing in the sun, amid grains of snow that quivered in the 
                air, while from a little window there came a smell of fresh-baked 
                bread, and the loaves were set out. All of this together was so 
                extraordinarily resplendent that Levin laughed and cried with 
                delight. Going a long way round by Gazetny Lane and Kislovka, 
                he went back again to the hotel, and, putting his watch before 
                him, sat down to wait for twelve o'clock. In the next room they 
                were talking about some sort of machines, and swindling, and coughing 
                their morning coughs. They did not realize that the hand was near 
                twelve. The hand reached it. Levin went out on the steps. The 
                sleigh drivers clearly knew all about it. They crowded round Levin 
                with happy faces, quarreling among themselves, and offering their 
                services. Trying not to offend the other sleigh drivers, and promising 
                to drive with them too, Levin took one and told him to drive to 
                the Shcherbatskys'. The sleigh driver was splendid in a white 
                shirt collar, sticking out over his overcoat and into his strong, 
                full-blooded red neck. The sleigh was high and comfortable, and 
                altogether such a one as Levin never drove in after, and the horse 
                was a good one, and tried to gallop yet didn't seem to move. The 
                driver knew the Shcherbatskys' house, and drew up at the entrance, 
                squaring his arms and saying a `Whoa!' especially indicative of 
                respect for his fare. The Shcherbatskys' hall porter certainly 
                knew all about it. This was evident from the smile in his eyes 
                and the way he said: </p>
              <p> `Well, it's a long while since you've been to see us, Konstantin 
                Dmitrievich!' </p>
              <p> Not only did he know all about it, but he was unmistakably delighted 
                and making efforts to conceal his joy. Looking into his kindly 
                old eyes, Levin realized even something new in his happiness. 
              </p>
              <p> `Are they up?' </p>
              <p> `Pray walk in! Leave it here,' said he, smiling, as Levin would 
                have come back to take his hat. That meant something. </p>
              <p> `To whom shall I announce your honor?' asked the footman. </p>
              <p> The footman, though a young man, and one of the new school of 
                footmen - a dandy - was a very kindhearted, good fellow, and he 
                too knew all about it. </p>
              <p> `The Princess... the Prince... the young Princess...' said Levin. 
              </p>
              <p> The first person he saw was Mademoiselle Linon. She walked across 
                the room, and her ringlets and her face were beaming. He had barely 
                spoken to her, when suddenly he heard the rustle of a skirt at 
                the door, and Mademoiselle Linon vanished from Levin's eyes, and 
                a joyful terror came over him at the nearness of his happiness. 
                Mademoiselle Linon was in great haste, and, leaving him, went 
                out at the other door. Directly she had gone out, swift, swift 
                light steps sounded on the parquet, and his bliss, his life, his 
                own self - what was best in himself, what he had so long sought 
                and longed for - was quickly, so quickly approaching him. She 
                did not walk, but seemed, by some unseen force, to float toward 
                him. </p>
              <p> He saw nothing but her clear, truthful eyes, frightened by the 
                same bliss of love that flooded his heart. Those eyes were shining 
                nearer and nearer, blinding him with their light of love. She 
                stopped close to him, touching him. Her hands rose and dropped 
                on his shoulders. </p>
              <p> She had done all she could - she had run up to him and given 
                herself up entirely, shy and happy. He put his arms round her, 
                and pressed his lips to her mouth, which sought his kiss. </p>
              <p> She too had not slept all night, and had been expecting him 
                all the morning. </p>
              <p> Her mother and father had consented without demur, and were 
                happy in her happiness. She had been waiting for him. She wanted 
                to be the first to tell him her happiness and his. She had got 
                ready to see him alone, and had been delighted at the idea, and 
                had been shy and ashamed, and did not know herself what she was 
                to do. She had heard his steps and voice, and had waited at the 
                door for Mademoiselle Linon to go. Mademoiselle Linon had gone 
                away. Without thinking, without asking herself how and what, she 
                had gone up to him, and did as she was doing. </p>
              <p> `Let us go to mamma!' she said, taking him by the hand. For 
                a long while he could say nothing, not so much because he was 
                afraid of desecrating the loftiness of his emotion by a word, 
                as that every time he tried to say something, instead of words 
                he felt that tears of happiness were welling up. He took her hand 
                and kissed it. </p>
              <p> `Can it be true?' he said at last in a choked voice. `I can't 
                believe you love me, dear!' </p>
              <p> She smiled at that `dear,' and at the timidity with which he 
                glanced at her. </p>
              <p> `Yes!' she said significantly, deliberately. `I am so happy!' 
              </p>
              <p> Without letting go his hand, she went into the drawing room. 
                The Princess, seeing them, breathed quickly, and immediately began 
                to cry, and then immediately began to laugh, and, with a vigorous 
                step Levin had not expected, ran up to him, and hugging his head, 
                kissed him, wetting his cheeks with her tears. </p>
              <p> `So it is all settled! I am glad. Love her. I am glad... Kitty!' 
              </p>
              <p> `You've not been long settling things,' said the old Prince, 
                trying to seem unmoved; but Levin noticed that his eyes were wet 
                when he turned to him. `I've long - always - wished for this!' 
                said the Prince, taking Levin by the arm and drawing him toward 
                himself. `Even when this little featherhead fancied...' </p>
              <p> `Papa!' shrieked Kitty, and shut his mouth with her hands. </p>
              <p> `Well, I won't!' he said. `I'm very, very... plea... Oh, what 
                a fool I am....' </p>
              <p> He embraced Kitty, kissed her face, her hand, her face again, 
                and made the sign of the cross over her. </p>
              <p> And there came over Levin a new feeling of love for this man, 
                the old Prince, till then so little known to him, when he saw 
                how slowly and tenderly Kitty kissed his muscular hand. </p>

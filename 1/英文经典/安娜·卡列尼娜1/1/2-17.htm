              <p> <br>
                Stepan Arkadyevich went upstairs with his pocket bulging with 
                notes which the merchant had paid him for three months in advance. 
                The business of the forest was over, the money in his pocket; 
                their shooting had been excellent, and Stepan Arkadyevich was 
                in the happiest frame of mind, and therefore felt especially anxious 
                to dissipate the ill-humor that had come upon Levin. He wanted 
                to finish the day at supper as pleasantly as it had been begun. 
                <br>
                Levin certainly was out of humor, and, in spite of all his desire 
                to be affectionate and cordial to his charming guest, he could 
                not control his mood. The aftereffects of the intoxication of 
                the news that Kitty was not married had gradually begun to work 
                upon him. </p>
              <p> Kitty was not married, and was ill, and ill from love for a 
                man who had slighted her. This offense, as it were, rebounded 
                upon him. Vronsky had slighted her, and she had slighted him, 
                Levin. Consequently Vronsky had the right to despise Levin, and 
                therefore he was his enemy. But all this Levin did not think of. 
                He vaguely felt that there was something in it insulting to him, 
                and he was not angry now at what had disturbed him, but he fell 
                foul of everything that presented itself. The stupid sale of the 
                forest, the fraud practised upon Oblonsky and concluded in his 
                house, exasperated him. </p>
              <p> `Well, finished?' he said, meeting Stepan Arkadyevich upstairs. 
                `Would you like supper?' </p>
              <p> `Well, I wouldn't say no to it. What an appetite I get in the 
                country! Wonderful! Why didn't you offer Riabinin something?' 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, damn him!' </p>
              <p> `Still, how you do treat him!' said Oblonsky. `You didn't even 
                shake hands with him. Why not shake hands with him?' </p>
              <p> `Because I don't shake hands with a waiter, and a waiter's a 
                hundred times better than he is.' </p>
              <p> `What a reactionist you are, really! What about the amalgamation 
                of classes?' said Oblonsky. </p>
              <p> `Anyone who likes it is welcome to it, but it sickens me.' </p>
              <p> `You're a downright reactionist, I see.' </p>
              <p> `Really. I have never considered what I am. I am Konstantin 
                Levin, and nothing else.' </p>
              <p> `And Konstantin Levin very much out of temper,' said Stepan 
                Arkadyevich, smiling. </p>
              <p> `Yes, I am out of temper, and do you know why? Because - excuse 
                me - of your stupid sale....' </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich frowned good-humoredly, like one who feels 
                himself teased and attacked for no fault of his own. </p>
              <p> `Come, enough about that!' he said. `When did anybody ever sell 
                anything without being told immediately after the sale, ``It was 
                worth much more'? But when one wants to sell, no one will give 
                anything.... No, I see you've a grudge against that unlucky Riabinin.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Maybe I have. And do you know why? You'll say again that I'm 
                a reactionist, or some other terrible word; but all the same it 
                does annoy and anger me to see on all sides the impoverishing 
                of the nobility to which I belong, and, in spite of the amalgamation 
                of classes, I'm glad to belong. And their impoverishment is not 
                due to living in luxury - that would be nothing; living in good 
                style - that's the proper thing for noblemen: it's only the nobles 
                who know how to do it. Now, the peasants about us buy land, and 
                I don't mind that. The gentleman does nothing, while the peasant 
                works and supplants the idle man. That's as it should be. And 
                I welcome the peasant. But I do mind seeing the process of impoverishment 
                from a sort of - I don't know what to call it - innocence. Here 
                a Polish lessee bought for half its value a magnificent estate 
                from a lady who lives in Nice. And there a merchant leases land, 
                worth ten roubles in rent the dessiatina, for one rouble. Here, 
                for no kind of reason, you've made that cheat a present of thirty 
                thousand roubles.' </p>
              <p> `Well, what should I have done? Counted every tree?' </p>
              <p> `Of course, they must be counted. You didn't count them, but 
                Riabinin did. Riabinin's children will have means of livelihood 
                and education, while yours, like as not, won't!' </p>
              <p> `Well, you must excuse me, but there's something mean in this 
                counting. We have our business and they have theirs, and they 
                must make their profit. Anyway, the thing's done, and there's 
                an end of it. And here come some fried eggs, my favorite dish. 
                And Agathya Mikhailovna will give us that marvelous herb brandy....' 
              </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich sat down at the table and began jollying 
                Agathya Mikhailovna, assuring her that it was long since he had 
                tasted such a dinner and such a supper. </p>
              <p> `Well, you praise it, at any rate,' said Agathya Mikhailovna, 
                `but Konstantin Dmitrievich, no matter what you give him - even 
                a crust of bread - will just eat it and walk away.' </p>
              <p> Though Levin tried to control himself, he was gloomy and silent. 
                He wanted to put one question to Stepan Arkadyevich, but he could 
                not bring himself to the point, and could not find the words or 
                the moment in which to put it. Stepan Arkadyevich had gone down 
                to his room, undressed, again washed, and, attired in a nightshirt 
                with goffered frills, had got into bed, but Levin still lingered 
                in his room, talking of various trifling matters, and not daring 
                to ask what he wanted to know. </p>
              <p> `How wonderfully they make the soap,' he said gazing at a piece 
                of soap he was unwrapping, which Agathya Mikhailovna had placed 
                in readiness for the guest, but a brand which Oblonsky did not 
                use. `Just look - why, it's a work of art.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, everything's brought to such a pitch of perfection nowadays,' 
                said Stepan Arkadyevich, with a moist and blissful yawn. `The 
                theater, for instance, and the entertainments... A-a-a!' he yawned. 
                `The electric light everywhere... A-a-a!' </p>
              <p> `Yes, the electric light,' said Levin. `Yes. Oh, and where's 
                Vronsky now?' he asked suddenly, laying down the soap. </p>
              <p> `Vronsky?' said Stepan Arkadyevich, checking his yawn; `he's 
                in Peterburg. He left soon after you did, and hasn't been once 
                in Moscow since. And, do you know, Kostia, I'll tell you the truth,' 
                he went on, leaning his elbow on the table, and, with his hand, 
                propping up his handsome ruddy face, in which his humid, good-natured, 
                sleepy eyes shone like stars. `It's your own fault. You took fright 
                at the sight of your rival. But, as I told you at the time, I 
                couldn't say which had the better chance. Why didn't you fight 
                it out? I told you at the time that...' He yawned inwardly, without 
                opening his mouth. </p>
              <p> `Does he know, or doesn't he, that I did propose?' Levin wondered 
                gazing at him. `Yes, there's something humbugging, something diplomatic 
                in his face.' And, feeling he was blushing, he looked Stepan Arkadyevich 
                straight in the face without speaking. </p>
              <p> `If there was anything on her side at that time, it was nothing 
                but a superficial attraction,' pursued Oblonsky. `His being such 
                a perfect aristocrat, you know, and his future position in society, 
                had an influence not with her, but with her mother.' </p>
              <p> Levin scowled. The humiliation of his rejection stung him to 
                the heart, as though it were a fresh wound he had only just received. 
                But he was at home, and the walls of home are a support. </p>
              <p> `Wait, wait,' he began, interrupting Oblonsky. `You talk of 
                his being an aristocrat. But allow me to ask what it consists 
                of, that aristocracy of Vronsky or of anybody else, beside which 
                I can be looked down upon? You consider Vronsky an aristocrat, 
                but I don't. A man whose father crawled up from nothing at all 
                by intrigue, and whose mother - God knows whom she wasn't mixed 
                up with... No, excuse me, but I consider myself aristocratic, 
                and people like me, who can point back in the past to three or 
                four honorable generations of their family, of the highest degree 
                of breeding (talent and intellect, of course, are another matter), 
                and have never curried favor with anyone, never depended on anyone 
                for anything, like my father and my grandfather. And I know many 
                such. You think it mean of me to count the trees in my forest, 
                while you make Riabinin a present of thirty thousand; but you 
                get from the government your liferent, and I don't know what, 
                while I shall not, and so I prize what's come to me from my ancestors, 
                or has been won by hard work... We are aristocrats, and not those 
                who can only exist by favor of the powerful ones of this earth, 
                and who can be bought for twenty kopecks.' </p>
              <p> `Well, but whom are you attacking? I agree with you,' said Stepan 
                Arkadyevich, sincerely and genially; though he was aware that 
                in the class of those who could be bought for twenty kopecks Levin 
                was reckoning him as well. Levin's animation gave him genuine 
                pleasure. `Whom are you attacking? A good deal of what you say 
                is not true about Vronsky, of course, but I won't talk about that. 
                I tell you straight out, if I were you, I should go back with 
                me to Moscow, and...' </p>
              <p> `No; I don't know whether you know it or not, but I don't care. 
                And I tell you - I did propose, and was rejected, and Katerina 
                Alexandrovna is nothing now to me but a painful and humiliating 
                reminiscence.' </p>
              <p> `Why? What nonsense!' </p>
              <p> `But we won't talk about it. Please forgive me, if I've been 
                nasty,' said Levin. Now that he had opened his heart, he became 
                as he had been in the morning. `You're not angry with me, Stiva? 
                Please don't be angry,' he said, and, smiling, he took his hand. 
              </p>
              <p> `Of course not; not a bit - nor is there any reason to be. I'm 
                glad we've spoken openly. And, do you know, stand shooting in 
                the morning is usually good - why not go? I might go, without 
                sleeping, straight from shooting to the station.' </p>
              <p> `Capital.' </p>

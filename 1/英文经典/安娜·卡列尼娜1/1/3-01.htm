              <p><br>
                Sergei Ivanovich Koznishev wanted a rest from mental work, and 
                instead of going abroad as he usually did, he came toward the 
                end of May to stay in the country with his brother. In his judgment 
                the best sort of life was a country life. He had come now to enjoy 
                such a life at his brother's. Konstantin Levin was very glad to 
                have him, especially as he did not expect his brother Nikolai 
                that summer. But in spite of his affection and respect for Sergei 
                Ivanovich, Konstantin Levin was uncomfortable with his brother 
                in the country. It made him uncomfortable, and it even annoyed 
                him, to see his brother's attitude to the country. To Konstantin 
                Levin the country was the background of life - that is of pleasures, 
                endeavors, labor; to Sergei Ivanovich the country meant on one 
                hand rest from work, on the other a valuable antidote to laxness 
                - an antidote which he took with satisfaction and a sense of its 
                salutariness. To Konstantin Levin the country was good because 
                it afforded a field for labor, of the usefulness of which there 
                could be no doubt; to Sergei Ivanovich the country was particularly 
                good, because there it was possible and fitting to do nothing. 
                Moreover, Sergei Ivanovich's attitude toward `the people' rather 
                piqued Konstantin. Sergei Ivanovich used to say that he knew and 
                liked `the people,' and he often talked to the peasants, which 
                he knew how to do without affectation or condescension, and from 
                every such conversation he would deduce general conclusions in 
                favor of `the people' and in confirmation of his knowing them. 
                Konstantin Levin did not like such an attitude toward `the people.' 
                To Konstantin `the people' was simply the chief partner in the 
                common labor, and in spite of all the respect and the love, almost 
                like that of kinship, he had for the peasant (sucked in probably, 
                as he said himself, with the milk of his peasant nurse), Konstantin 
                as a fellow worker with them, while sometimes enthusiastic over 
                the vigor, gentleness, and justice of these men, was very often, 
                when their common labors called for other qualities, exasperated 
                with the peasant for his carelessness, slovenliness, drunkenness 
                and lying. If he had been asked whether he liked or didn't like 
                `the people,' Konstantin Levin would have been absolutely at a 
                loss what to reply. He liked and did not like `the people,' just 
                as he liked and did not like men in general. Of course, being 
                a goodhearted man, he liked men more than he disliked them, and 
                so too with `the people.' But like or dislike `the people' as 
                something peculiar he could not, not only because he lived with 
                `the people,' and all his interests were bound up with theirs, 
                but also because he regarded himself as a part of `the people,' 
                did not see any peculiar qualities or failings distinguishing 
                himself from `the people,' and could not contrast himself with 
                them. Moreover, although he had lived so long in the closest relations 
                with the peasants, as farmer and arbitrator, and what was more, 
                as adviser (the peasants trusted him, and for forty verstas round 
                they would come to ask his advice), he had no definite views of 
                `the people,' and would have been as much at a loss to answer 
                the question whether he knew `the people' as the question whether 
                he liked them. For him to say he knew `the people' would have 
                been the same as to say he knew men. He was continually watching 
                and getting to know people of all sorts, and among them peasants, 
                whom he regarded as good and interesting people, and he was continually 
                observing new points in them, altering his former views of them 
                and forming new ones. <br>
                With Sergei Ivanovich it was quite the contrary. Just as he liked 
                and praised a country life in comparison with the life he did 
                not like, so too he liked `the people' in contradistinction to 
                the class of men he did not like, and so too he knew `the people' 
                as something distinct from, and opposed to, men in general. In 
                his methodical brain there were distinctly formulated certain 
                aspects of peasant life, deduced partly from that life itself, 
                but chiefly from contrast with other modes of life. He never changed 
                his opinion of `the people' and his sympathetic attitude toward 
                them. </p>
              <p> In the discussions that arose between the brothers on their 
                views of `the people,' Sergei Ivanovich always got the better 
                of his brother, precisely because Sergei Ivanovich had definite 
                ideas about the peasant - his character, his qualities, and his 
                tastes; Konstantin Levin had no definite and unalterable idea 
                on the subject, and so in their arguments Konstantin was readily 
                convicted of contradicting himself. </p>
              <p> In Sergei Ivanovich's eyes his younger brother was a capital 
                fellow, with his heart in the right place (as he expressed it 
                in French), but with a mind which, though fairly quick, was too 
                much influenced by the impressions of the moment, and consequently 
                filled with contradictions. With all the condescension of an elder 
                brother he sometimes explained to him the true import of things, 
                but he derived little satisfaction from arguing with him because 
                he got the better of him too easily. </p>
              <p> Konstantin Levin regarded his brother as a man of immense intellect 
                and culture, as generous in the highest sense of the word, and 
                possessed of a special faculty for working for the public good. 
                But in the depths of his heart, the older he became, and the more 
                intimately he knew his brother, the more and more frequently the 
                thought struck him that this faculty of working for the public 
                good, of which he felt himself utterly devoid, was possibly not 
                so much a quality as a lack of something - not a lack of good, 
                honest, noble desires and tastes, but a lack of vital force, of 
                what is called heart, of that impulse which drives a man to choose 
                some one out of the innumerable paths of life, and to care only 
                for that one. The better he knew his brother, the more he noticed 
                that Sergei Ivanovich, and many other people who worked for the 
                public welfare, were not led by any impulse of the heart to care 
                for the public good, but reasoned from intellectual considerations 
                that it was a right thing to take an interest in public affairs, 
                and consequently took an interest in them. Levin was confirmed 
                in this conjecture by observing that his brother did not take 
                questions affecting the public welfare or the question of the 
                immortality of the soul a bit more to heart than he did chess 
                problems, or the ingenious construction of a new machine. </p>
              <p> Besides this, Konstantin Levin was not at his ease with his 
                brother, because in the country, especially in summertime, Levin 
                was continually busy with work on the land, and the long summer 
                day was not long enough for him to get through all he had to do, 
                while Sergei Ivanovich was merely taking a holiday. But though 
                he was taking a holiday now - that is to say, he was doing no 
                writing - he was so used to intellectual activity that he liked 
                to put into concise and eloquent shape the ideas that occurred 
                to him, and liked to have someone listen to him. His most usual 
                and natural listener was his brother. And so, in spite of the 
                friendliness and directness of their relations, Konstantin felt 
                an awkwardness in leaving him alone. Sergei Ivanovich liked to 
                stretch himself on the grass in the sun, and to lie so, basking 
                and chatting lazily. </p>
              <p> `You wouldn't believe,' he would say to his brother, `what a 
                pleasure this rural laziness is to me. Not an idea in one's brain 
                - as empty as a drum!' </p>
              <p> But Konstantin Levin found it dull sitting and listening to 
                him, especially when he knew that while he was away manure would 
                be carted into fields not plowed ready for it, and heaped up God 
                knows how; and the shares in the plows would not be screwed in, 
                so that they would come off, and then his men would say the new 
                plows were a silly invention, and there was nothing like the old 
                wooden plow, and so on. </p>
              <p> `Come, you've done enough trudging about in the heat,' Sergei 
                Ivanovich would say to him. </p>
              <p> `No, I must just run round to the countinghouse for a minute,' 
                Levin would answer, and would run off to the fields. </p>

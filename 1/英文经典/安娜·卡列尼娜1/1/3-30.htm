              <p><br>
                At the end of September the timber had been carted for building 
                the cattle yard on the land that had been allotted to the association 
                of peasants, and the butter from the cows was sold and the profits 
                divided. In Practice the system worked capitally, or, at least, 
                so it seemed to Levin. In order to work out the whole subject 
                theoretically and to complete his book, which, in Levin's daydreams, 
                was not merely to effect a revolution in political economy, but 
                to annihilate that science entirely and to lay the foundation 
                of a new science of the relation of the people to the soil, all 
                that was left to do was to make a tour abroad, and to study on 
                the spot all that had been done in the same direction, and to 
                collect conclusive evidence that all that had been done there 
                was not what was wanted. Levin was only waiting for the delivery 
                of his wheat to receive the money for it and go abroad. But the 
                rains began preventing the harvesting of the corn and potatoes 
                left in the fields, and putting a stop to all work, even to the 
                delivery of the wheat. The mud was impassable along the roads; 
                two mills were carried away by the spate, and the weather got 
                worse and worse. </p>
              <p>On the 30th of September the sun came out in the morning, and, 
                hoping for fine weather, Levin began making final preparations 
                for his journey. He gave orders for the wheat to be delivered, 
                sent the bailiff to the merchant to get the money owing him, and 
                went out himself to give some final directions on the estate before 
                setting off. </p>
              <p> Having finished all his business, soaked through with the streams 
                of water which kept running into his leather coat and down his 
                neck and his boot tops, but in the keenest and most confident 
                temper, Levin turned homeward in the evening. The weather had 
                become worse than ever toward evening; the hail lashed the drenched 
                mare so cruelly that she went along sideways, shaking her head 
                and ears; but Levin was all right under his hood, and he looked 
                cheerfully about him at the muddy streams running under the wheels, 
                at the drops hanging on every bare twig, at the whiteness of the 
                patch of unmelted hailstones on the planks of the bridge, at the 
                thick layer of still succulent, fleshy leaves that lay heaped 
                up about the stripped elm tree. In spite of the gloominess of 
                nature around him, he felt peculiarly eager. The talks he had 
                been having with the peasants in the farther village had shown 
                that they were beginning to get used to their new position. The 
                innkeeper, an old man, to whose inn he had gone to get dry evidently 
                approved of Levin's plan, and of his own accord proposed to enter 
                the partnership for purchasing of cattle. </p>
              <p> `I have only to go on stubbornly toward my aim, and I shall 
                attain my end,' thought Levin; `and it's something to work and 
                take trouble for. This is not a matter of myself individually, 
                the question of the public welfare comes into it. The whole system 
                of agriculture, the chief element in the condition of the people, 
                must be completely transformed. Instead of poverty - general prosperity 
                and content; instead of hostility - harmony and unity of interests. 
                In short, a bloodless revolution, but a revolution of the greatest 
                magnitude, beginning in the little circle of our district, then 
                the province, then Russia, and the whole world. Because a just 
                idea cannot but be fruitful. Yes, it's an aim worth working for. 
                And the fact that it is I, Kostia Levin, who went to a ball in 
                a black tie, and was refused by the Shcherbatsky girl, and who 
                is intrinsically such a pitiful, worthless creature to himself 
                - that proves nothing; I feel sure Franklin felt just as worthless, 
                and he too had no faith in himself, thinking of himself as a whole. 
                That means nothing. And he too, most likely, had an Agathya Mikhailovna 
                to whom he confided his secrets.' </p>
              <p> Musing on such thoughts Levin reached home in the darkness. 
              </p>
              <p> The bailiff, who had been to the merchant, had come back and 
                brought part of the money for the wheat. An agreement had been 
                made with the old innkeeper, and on the road the bailiff had learned 
                that everywhere the corn was still standing in the fields, so 
                that his one hundred and sixty shocks that had not been carried 
                were nothing in comparison with the losses of others. </p>
              <p> After dinner Levin was sitting, as he usually did, in an easy 
                chair with a book, and as he read he went on thinking of the journey 
                before him in connection with his book. Today all the significance 
                of his book rose before him with special distinctness, and whole 
                periods ranged themselves in his mind in illustration of his theories. 
                `I must write that down,' he thought. `That ought to form a brief 
                introduction, which I thought unnecessary before.' He got up to 
                go to his writing table, and Laska, lying at his feet, got up 
                too, stretching and looking at him as though to inquire where 
                to go. But he had not time to write it down, for the overseers 
                had come for receiving orders, and Levin went out into the hall 
                to meet them. </p>
              <p> After giving orders, that is to say, directions about the labors 
                of the next day, and seeing all the peasants who had business 
                with him, Levin went back to his study and sat down to work. Laska 
                lay under the table; Agathya Mikhailovna settled herself in her 
                place with her stocking. </p>
              <p> After writing for a little while, Levin suddenly thought with 
                exceptional vividness of Kitty, her refusal, and their last meeting. 
                He got up and began walking about the room. </p>
              <p> `What's the use of being downhearted?' said Agathya Mikhailovna. 
                `Come, why do you stay on at home? You ought to go to some warm 
                springs, especially now that you're ready for the journey.' </p>
              <p> `Well, I am going away the day after tomorrow, Agathya Mikhailovna; 
                I must finish my work.' </p>
              <p> `There, there, your work, you say! As if you hadn't done enough 
                for the peasants! Why, as 'tis, they're saying, ``Your master 
                will be getting some honor from the Czar for it.' Indeed, 'tis 
                a strange thing: why need you worry about the peasants?' </p>
              <p> `I'm not worrying about them; I'm doing it for my own good.' 
              </p>
              <p> Agathya Mikhailovna knew every detail of Levin's plans for his 
                land. Levin often put his views before her in all their complexity, 
                and not uncommonly he argued with her and did not agree with her 
                comments. But on this occasion she entirely misinterpreted what 
                he had said. </p>
              <p> `Of one's soul's salvation we all know and must think before 
                all else,' she said with a sigh. `Parfion Denissich now, for all 
                he was no scholar, died a death whose like may God grant to every 
                one of us,' she said, referring to a servant who had died recently. 
                `Took the sacrament and all.' </p>
              <p> `That's not what I mean,' said he. `I mean that I'm acting for 
                my own advantage. It's all the better for me if the peasants do 
                their work better.' </p>
              <p> `Well, whatever you do, if he's a lazy good-for-naught, everything'll 
                be at sixes and sevens. If he has a conscience, he'll work, and 
                if not, there's no doing anything.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, come, you say yourself Ivan has begun looking after the 
                cattle better.' </p>
              <p> `All I say is,' answered Agathya Mikhailovna, evidently not 
                speaking at random, but in strict sequence of ideas, `that you 
                ought to get married - that's what I say.' </p>
              <p> Agathya Mikhailovna's allusion to the very subject he had only 
                just been thinking about hurt and stung him. Levin scowled, and 
                without answering her, he sat down again to his work, repeating 
                to himself all that he had been thinking of the real significance 
                of that work. Only at intervals he listened in the stillness to 
                the click of Agathya Mikhailovna's needles, and, recollecting 
                what he did not want to remember, he would frown again. </p>
              <p> At nine o'clock they heard the bell and the faint vibration 
                of a carriage over the mud. </p>
              <p> `Well, here's visitors come to us, and you won't be dull,' said 
                Agathya Mikhailovna, getting up and going to the door. But Levin 
                overtook her. His work was not going well now, and he was glad 
                of a visitor, whoever it might be. </p>

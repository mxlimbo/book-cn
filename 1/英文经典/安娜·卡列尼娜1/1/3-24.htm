                The night spent by Levin on the haycock did not pass without an 
                effect upon him. The way in which he had been managing his land 
                revolted him and lost all attraction for him. In spite of the 
                magnificent harvest, never had there been (or, at least, it had 
                never seemed so to him) so many hindrances and so many quarrels 
                between him and the peasants as that year, and the origin of these 
                failures and this hostility was now perfectly comprehensible to 
                him. The delight he had experienced in the work itself, and the 
                consequent greater intimacy with the peasants, the envy he felt 
                of them, of their life, the desire to adopt that life, which had 
                been to him that night not a dream but an intention, the execution 
                of which he had thought out in detail - all this had so transformed 
                his view of the farming of the land as he had managed it, that 
                he could not take his former interest in it, and could not help 
                seeing that unpleasant relation between him and the workpeople 
                which was the foundation of it all. The herd of improved cows 
                such as Pava, the whole land plowed over and enriched, the nine 
                level fields surrounded with willow fences, the ninety dessiatinas 
                heavily manured, drill plows, and all the rest of it - it was 
                all splendid, if only the work had been done by himself, or by 
                himself and his comrades, by people in sympathy with him. But 
                he saw clearly now (his work on a book of agriculture, in which 
                the chief element in husbandry was to have been the laborer, greatly 
                assisted him in this) that the sort of farming he was carrying 
                on was nothing but a cruel and stubborn struggle between him and 
                the laborers, in which there was on one side - his side - a continual 
                intense effort to change everything to a pattern he considered 
                better; on the other side, the natural order of things. And in 
                this struggle he saw that, with immense expenditure of force on 
                his side, and with no effort or even intention on the other side, 
                the sole attainment was that the work did not go to the liking 
                of either side, and that splendid tools, splendid cattle and land 
                were spoiled with no good to anyone. Worst of all, the energy 
                expended on this work was not merely wasted. He could not help 
                feeling now, since the meaning of his system had become clear 
                to him, that the aim of his energy was a most unworthy one. In 
                reality, what was the struggle about? He was struggling for every 
                groat (and he could not help it, for he had only to relax his 
                efforts, and he would not have had the money to pay his laborers' 
                wages), while they were only struggling to be able to do their 
                work easily and agreeably - that is to say, as they were used 
                to doing it. It was for his interests that every laborer should 
                work as hard as possible, and that while doing so he should keep 
                his wits about him, so as to try not to break the winnowing machines, 
                the horse rakes, the threshing machines, that he should attend 
                to what he was doing. What the laborer wanted was to work as pleasantly 
                as possible, with rests, and, above all, carelessly and heedlessly, 
                without thinking. That summer Levin saw this at every step. He 
                sent the men to mow some clover for hay, picking out the worst 
                patches where the clover was overgrown with grass and weeds and 
                of no use for seed; again and again they mowed his best dessiatinas 
                of seed clover, justifying themselves by the pretext that the 
                bailiff had told them to, and trying to pacify him with the assurance 
                that it would make splendid hay; but he knew that it was because 
                those dessiatinas were so much easier to mow. He sent out a hay 
                machine for pitching the hay - it was broken at the first row 
                because it was dull work for a peasant to sit on the seat in front 
                with the great wings waving above him. And he was told: `Don't 
                trouble - sure, the womenfolks will pitch it quick enough.' The 
                plows were practically useless, because it never occurred to the 
                laborer to raise the colter when he turned the plow, and in forcing 
                it round, he tortured the horse and spoiled the ground - and then 
                begged Levin not to mind it. The horses were allowed to stray 
                into the wheat because not a single laborer wanted to be night 
                watchman, and, in spite of orders to the contrary, the laborers 
                insisted on taking turns for night duty about the horses; and 
                when Vanka, after working all day long, fell asleep, he would 
                say, very penitent for his fault: `Do what you will to me.' </p>
              <p>Three of the best heifers were allowed to overeat themselves 
                to death, by letting them into the clover aftermath without care 
                as to drenching them, and nothing would make the men believe that 
                they had been blown out by the clover, but they told Levin, by 
                way of consolation, that one of his neighbors had lost a hundred 
                and twelve head of cattle in three days. All this happened, not 
                because anyone felt ill will to Levin or to his farming; on the 
                contrary, he knew that they liked him, thinking him a simple gentleman 
                (their highest praise); but it happened simply because all they 
                wanted was to work merrily and carelessly, and his interests were 
                not only remote and incomprehensible to them, but fatally opposed 
                to their most just claims. Long before, Levin had felt dissatisfaction 
                with his own position in regard to the land. He saw that his boat 
                leaked, but he did not look for the leak, perhaps purposely deceiving 
                himself. But now he could deceive himself no longer. The farming 
                of the land, as he was managing it, had become not merely unattractive 
                but revolting to him, and he could take no further interest in 
                it. </p>
              <p> To this now was joined the presence, only thirty verstas off, 
                of Kitty Shcherbatskaia, whom he longed to see and could not. 
                Darya Alexandrovna Oblonskaia had invited him, when he was over 
                there, to come; to come with the object of renewing his proposal 
                to her sister, who would, so she gave him to understand, accept 
                it now. Levin himself had felt on seeing Kitty Shcherbatskaia 
                that he had never ceased to love her; but he could not go over 
                to the Oblonskys', knowing she was there. The fact that he had 
                proposed to her, and that she had refused him, had placed an insuperable 
                barrier between her and him. `I can't ask her to be my wife merely 
                because she can't be the wife of the man she wanted to marry,' 
                he said to himself. The thought of this made him cold and hostile 
                to her. `I should not be able to speak to her without a feeling 
                of reproach; I could not look at her without resentment; and she 
                will only hate me all the more, as she's bound to. And besides, 
                how can I now, after what Darya Alexandrovna told me, go to see 
                them? Can I help showing that I know what she told me? And I shall 
                come to forgive her magnanimously, and take pity on her! And go 
                through a performance before her of forgiving, and deigning to 
                bestow my love on her!... Why did Darya Alexandrovna tell me that? 
                I might have seen her by chance - then everything would have happened 
                of itself; but, as it is, it's out of the question - out of the 
                question!' </p>
              <p> Darya Alexandrovna sent him a letter, asking him for a sidesaddle 
                for Kitty's use. `I'm told you have a sidesaddle,' she wrote to 
                him; `I hope you will bring it over yourself.' </p>
              <p> This was more than he could stand. How could a woman of any 
                intelligence, of any delicacy, put her sister in such a humiliating 
                position! He wrote ten notes, and tore them all up, and then sent 
                the saddle without any reply. To write that he would come was 
                impossible, because he could not come; to write that he could 
                not come because something prevented him, or that he would be 
                away, would be still worse. He sent the saddle without any answer; 
                and with a sense of having done something shameful, he handed 
                over all the now revolting business of the estate to his bailiff, 
                and set off next day to a remote district to see his friend Sviiazhsky, 
                who had splendid marshes for double snipes in his neighborhood, 
                and had lately written, asking him to keep a long-standing promise 
                to visit him. The snipe marsh, in the Surovsky district, had long 
                tempted Levin, but he had continually put off this visit on account 
                of his work on the estate. Now he was glad to get away from the 
                neighborhood of the Shcherbatskys, and still more from his farmwork, 
                especially on a shooting expedition, which always served as the 
                best consolation in trouble. </p>

                `This is rather indiscreet, but it's so charming that one is awfully 
                tempted to tell the story,' said Vronsky, looking at her with 
                laughing eyes. `I don't intend to mention any names.' </p>
              <p>`But I shall guess them - so much the better.' </p>
              <p> `Listen, then: two festive young men were driving along...' 
              </p>
              <p> `Officers of your regiment, of course?' </p>
              <p> `I didn't say they were officers - just two young men who had 
                been lunching.' </p>
              <p> `In other words, drinking.' </p>
              <p> `Possibly. They were driving on their way to dinner with a friend 
                in the gayest of moods. And they catch sight of a pretty woman 
                in a hired sleigh, who overtakes them, looks back at them, and 
                - so it seemed to them, at any rate - nods to them and laughs. 
                They, of course, follow her - galloping at full speed. To their 
                amazement, the fair one alights at the entrance of the very house 
                to which they were going. The fair one darts upstairs to the top 
                floor. All they got was a glimpse of rosebud lips under a short 
                veil, and of exquisite little feet.' </p>
              <p> `You tell this with such feeling that it seems to me you yourself 
                must have been one of the two.' </p>
              <p> `But what did you tell me just now?... Well, the young men enter 
                their comrade's apartment - he was giving a farewell dinner. There 
                they certainly did take a drop too much, as is always the case 
                at farewell dinners. And at dinner they inquire who lives at the 
                top in that house. No one knows; only their host's valet, in answer 
                to their inquiry whether any ``young ladies' are living on the 
                top floor, answered that there were a great many of them. After 
                dinner the two young men go into their host's study, and write 
                a letter to the fair unknown. They composed a passionate epistle, 
                really a declaration, and then carry the letter upstairs themselves, 
                so as to explain whatever might prove not altogether clear in 
                the letter.' </p>
              <p> `Why do you tell me such nasty things? And then?' </p>
              <p> `They ring. A maidservant opens the door, they hand her the 
                letter, and assure her that they're both so enamored that they'll 
                die on the spot at the door. The maid, stupefied, carries on the 
                negotiations. Suddenly a gentleman appears - with side whiskers 
                like country sausages, he is as red as a lobster and, informing 
                them that there is no one living in that flat except his wife, 
                he sends them both packing.' </p>
              <p> `How do you know he had side whiskers like sausages, as you 
                put it?' </p>
              <p> `Ah, do but listen. Recently I went to make peace between them.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, and what was the upshot?' </p>
              <p> `That's the most interesting part. This couple turned out to 
                be a most happy one - a government clerk and his lady. The government 
                clerk lodges a complaint, whereupon I become a mediator - and 
                what a mediator!... I assure you Talleyrand was a nobody compared 
                to me.' </p>
              <p> `Just what was the difficulty?' </p>
              <p> `Ah, do but listen.... We make fitting apologies: ``We are in 
                despair; we entreat forgiveness for the unfortunate misunderstanding.'' 
                The government clerk with the country sausages begins to melt, 
                and he, too, desires to express his sentiments, but no sooner 
                does he begin to express them than he gets heated and says nasty 
                things, and again I'm obliged to trot out all my diplomatic talents. 
                ``I agree that their action was bad, but I beg of you to take 
                into consideration the misunderstanding, and their youth; besides, 
                the young men had just come from their lunch. You understand. 
                Their repentance is heartfelt and they beg you to forgive their 
                misbehavior.'' The government clerk was softened once more. ``I 
                consent, Count, and am ready to forgive but you must understand 
                that my wife - my wife! - a respectable woman is subjected to 
                annoyances, and insults, and impertinences by certain milksops, 
                scou-...'' Yet, you understand, the milksop is present, and it 
                is up to me to make peace between them. Again I trot out all my 
                diplomacy, and again, just as the matter is about to be concluded, 
                our friend the government clerk gets heated and turns red while 
                his country sausages bristle up, and I once more exert diplomatic 
                finesse.' </p>
              <p> `Ah, you must hear this story!' said Betsy, laughing, to a lady 
                who was entering the box. `He has made me laugh so much... Well, 
                bonne chance!' she added, giving Vronsky the one finger free from 
                holding her fan, and with a shrug of her shoulders letting down 
                the bodice of her gown, that had worked up, so as to be fittingly 
                and fully nude as she moved forward, toward the footlights, into 
                the lights of the gas, and within the ken of all. </p>
              <p> Vronsky drove to the French theater, where he really had to 
                see the colonel of his regiment, who never missed a single performance 
                there; he wanted to talk over his peacemaking, which had been 
                occupying and amusing him for the last three days. Petritsky, 
                whom he liked, was implicated in the affair, as well as another 
                fine fellow and excellent comrade, who had lately joined the regiment 
                - the young Prince Kedrov. But, mainly, the interests of the regiment 
                were involved as well. </p>
              <p> Both culprits were in Vronsky's squadron. The colonel of the 
                regiment had received a call from the government clerk, Venden, 
                with a complaint against his officers, who had insulted his wife. 
                His young wife, as Venden told the story - he had been married 
                half a year - had been at church with her mother, and, suddenly 
                feeling indisposed, due to her interesting condition, found that 
                she could not remain standing and drove home in the first sleigh 
                with the mettlesome coachman she came across. It was then that 
                the officers set off in pursuit of her; she was alarmed, and, 
                feeling still worse, ran home up the staircase. Venden himself, 
                on returning from his office, had heard a ring at their bell and 
                voices, had stepped out, and seeing the intoxicated officers with 
                a letter, he had pushed them out. He was asking that the culprits 
                be severely punished. </p>
              <p> `You may say what you will,' said the colonel to Vronsky, whom 
                he had invited to come and see him. `Petritsky is becoming impossible. 
                Not a week goes by without some scrape. This clerk chap won't 
                let matters drop - he'll go on with the thing.' </p>
              <p> Vronsky saw all the thanklessness of the business, and that 
                a duel was out of the question here; that everything must be done 
                to soften this government clerk, and hush the matter up. The colonel 
                had called in Vronsky precisely because he knew him to be an honorable 
                and intelligent man, but, above all, one to whom the honor of 
                the regiment was dear. They talked it over, and decided that Petritsky 
                and Kedrov must go with Vronsky to this government clerk and apologize. 
                The colonel and Vronsky were both fully aware that Vronsky's name 
                and insignia of aide-de-camp were bound to go a long way toward 
                softening the government clerk. And these two influences proved 
                in fact not without effect; though the result of the mediation 
                remained, as Vronsky had described, uncertain. </p>
              <p> On reaching the French theater, Vronsky retired to the foyer 
                with the colonel, and reported to him his success - or lack of 
                it. The colonel, thinking it all over, decided not to go on with 
                the matter; but then, for his own delectation, proceeded to question 
                Vronsky about the details of his interview and for a long while 
                could not restrain his laughter as he listened to Vronsky's story 
                of how the government clerk, after subsiding for a while, would 
                suddenly flare up again, as he recalled the details, and how Vronsky, 
                at the last half-word of conciliation, had skillfully maneuvered 
                a retreat, shoving Petritsky out before him. </p>
              <p> `It's a disgraceful scrape, but a killing one. Kedrov really 
                can't fight this gentleman! So he was awfully wrought up?' he 
                asked again, laughing. `But what do you think of Claire today? 
                She's a wonder!' he went on, speaking of a new French actress. 
                `No matter how often you see her, she's different each time. It's 
                only the French who can do that.' </p>

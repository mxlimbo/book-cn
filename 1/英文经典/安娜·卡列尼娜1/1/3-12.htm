              <p><br>
                The load was tied on. Ivan jumped down and took the quiet, sleek 
                horse by the bridle. The young wife flung the rake up on the load; 
                with a bold step, swinging her arms, she went to join the women, 
                who were forming a ring for the haymakers' dance. Ivan drove off 
                to the road and fell into line with the other loaded wagons. The 
                peasant women, with their rakes on their shoulders, gay with bright 
                flowers, and chattering with ringing, merry voices, walked behind 
                the hay wagon. One wild untrained female voice broke into a song, 
                and sang it alone through a verse, and then the same verse was 
                unanimously taken up and repeated by half a hundred strong healthy 
                voices, of all sorts, coarse and fine. </p>
              <p>The women, all singing, began to come close to Levin, and he 
                felt as though a storm were swooping down upon him with a thunder 
                of merriment. The storm swooped down, enveloped him and the haycock 
                on which he was lying, and the other haycocks, and wagonloads, 
                and the whole meadow and distant fields all seemed to be shaking 
                and singing to the measures of this wild merry song, with its 
                shouts and whistles and clapping. Levin felt envious of this health 
                and mirthfulness; he longed to take part in the expression of 
                this joy of life. But he could do nothing, and had to lie and 
                look on and listen. When the peasants, with their singing, had 
                vanished out of sight and hearing, a weary feeling of despondency 
                at his own isolation, his physical inactivity, his alienation 
                from this world, came over Levin. </p>
              <p> Some of the very peasants who had been most active in wrangling 
                with him over the hay, some whom he had treated with contumely, 
                and who had tried to cheat him - those very peasants had greeted 
                him good-humoredly, and evidently had not, were incapable of having, 
                any feeling of rancor against him, any regret, any recollection 
                even of having tried to deceive him. All that was drowned in a 
                sea of merry common labor. God gave the day, God gave the strength. 
                And the day and the strength were consecrated to labor, and that 
                labor was its own reward. For whom the labor? What would be its 
                fruits? These were idle considerations - beside the point. </p>
              <p> Often Levin had admired this life, often he had a sense of envy 
                of the men who led this life; but today, for the first time, especially 
                under the influence of what he had seen in the attitude of Ivan 
                Parmenov to his young wife, the idea presented itself definitely 
                to his mind that it was in his power to exchange the dreary, artificial, 
                idle, and individualistic life he was leading for this laborious, 
                pure, and generally delightful life. </p>
              <p> The old man who had been sitting beside him had long ago gone 
                home; the people had all gone their different ways. Those who 
                lived near had gone home, while those who came from afar were 
                gathered into a group for supper, and to spend the night in the 
                meadow. Levin, unobserved by the peasants, still lay on the haycock, 
                and still looked on, and listened, and mused. The peasants who 
                remained for the night in the meadow scarcely slept all the short 
                summer night. At first there was the sound of merry talk and general 
                laughing over the supper, then singing again, and laughter. </p>
              <p> All the long day of toil had left no trace in them save lightness 
                of heart. Before the early dawn all was hushed. Nothing was to 
                be heard but the night sounds of the frogs that never ceased in 
                the marsh, and the horses snorting in the mist that rose over 
                the meadow before morning. Rousing himself, Levin got up from 
                the haycock, and, looking at the stars, he saw that the night 
                was over. </p>
              <p> `Well, what am I going to do? How am I to set about it?' he 
                said to himself, trying to express to himself all the thoughts 
                and feelings he had passed through in this brief night. All the 
                thoughts and feelings he had passed through fell into three separate 
                trains of thought. One was the renunciation of his old life, of 
                his utterly useless education. This renunciation gave him satisfaction, 
                and was easy and simple. Another series of thoughts and mental 
                images related to the life he longed to live now. The simplicity, 
                the purity, the sanity of this life he felt clearly, and he was 
                convinced he would find in it its content, its peace, and its 
                dignity, of the lack of which he was so miserably conscious. But 
                a third series of ideas turned upon the question of how to effect 
                this transition from the old life to the new. And there nothing 
                took clear shape for him. `A wife. Work and the necessity of work. 
                Leave Pokrovskoe? Buy land? Become a member of a peasant community? 
                Marry a peasant girl? How am I to set about it?' he asked himself 
                again, and could not find an answer. `I haven't slept all night, 
                though, and I can't think it out clearly,' he said to himself. 
                `I'll work it out later. One thing's certain - this night has 
                decided my fate. All my old dreams of home life were absurd, not 
                the real thing,' he told himself. `It's all ever so much simpler 
                and better....' </p>
              <p> `How beautiful!' he thought, looking at the strange, as it were, 
                mother-of-pearl shell of white fleecy cloudlets resting right 
                over his head in the middle of the sky. `How exquisite it all 
                is in this exquisite night! And when was there time for that cloud 
                shell to form? Just now I looked at the sky, and there was nothing 
                in it - only two white streaks. Yes, and so imperceptibly, too, 
                my views of life changed!' </p>
              <p> He went out of the meadow and walked along the highroad toward 
                the village. A slight wind arose, and the sky looked gray and 
                sullen. The gloomy moment had come that usually precedes the dawn, 
                the full triumph of light over darkness. </p>
              <p> Shrinking from the cold, Levin walked rapidly, looking at the 
                ground. `What's that? Someone coming,' he thought, catching the 
                tinkle of bells, and lifting his head. Forty paces from him a 
                carriage and four with the luggage on its top was driving toward 
                him along the grassy highroad on which he was walking. The shaft 
                horses were tilted against the shafts by the ruts, but the dexterous 
                driver sitting on the box held the shaft over the ruts, so that 
                the wheels ran on the smooth part of the road. </p>
              <p> This was all Levin noticed, and without wondering who it could 
                be, he gazed absently at the coach. </p>
              <p> In the coach was an old lady dozing in one corner, and at the 
                window, evidently only just awake, sat a young girl holding in 
                both hands the ribbons of a white cap. With a face full of light 
                and thought, full of a subtle, complex inner life, that was remote 
                from Levin, she was gazing from the window at the glow of the 
                sunrise. </p>
              <p> At the very instant when this apparition was vanishing, the 
                truthful eyes glanced at him. She recognized him, and her face 
                lighted up with wondering delight. </p>
              <p> He could not be mistaken. There were no other eyes like those 
                in all the world. There was only one creature in the world that 
                could concentrate for him all the brightness and meaning of life. 
                It was she. It was Kitty. He comprehended that she was driving 
                to Ergushovo from the railway station. And everything that had 
                been stirring Levin during this sleepless night, all the resolutions 
                he had made, all vanished at once. He recalled with horror his 
                dreams of marrying a peasant girl. There only, in this carriage 
                that had crossed over to the other side of the road, and was rapidly 
                disappearing - there only could he find the solution of the riddle 
                of his life, which had weighed so agonizingly upon him of late. 
              </p>
              <p> She did not look out again. The sound of the carriage springs 
                was no longer audible, the bells could scarcely be heard. The 
                barking of dogs showed the carriage had reached the village, and 
                all that was left was the empty fields all round, the village 
                in front, and he himself isolated and apart from it all, wandering 
                lonely along the deserted highroad. </p>
              <p> He glanced at the sky, expecting to find there the cloud shell 
                he had been admiring and taking as the symbol of the ideas and 
                feelings of that night. There was nothing in the sky in the least 
                like a shell. There, in the remote heights above, a mysterious 
                change had been accomplished. There was no trace of a shell, and 
                there was stretched over fully half the sky an even cover of tiny, 
                and ever tinier, cloudlets. The sky had grown blue and bright; 
                and with the same softness, but with the same remoteness, it met 
                his questioning gaze. </p>
              <p> `No,' he said to himself, `however good that life of simplicity 
                and toil may be, I cannot go back to it. I love her.' </p>

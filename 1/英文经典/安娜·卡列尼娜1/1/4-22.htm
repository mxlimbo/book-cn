              <p><br>
                Stepan Arkadyevich, with the same somewhat solemn expression with 
                which he used to take his presidential chair at his board, walked 
                into Alexei Alexandrovich's room. Alexei Alexandrovich was walking 
                about his room with his hands behind his back, thinking of just 
                what Stepan Arkadyevich had been discussing with his wife. </p>
              <p>`I'm not interrupting you?' said Stepan Arkadyevich, on the sight 
                of his brother-in-law becoming suddenly aware of a sense of embarrassment 
                unusual with him. To conceal this embarrassment he took out a 
                newly purchased cigarette case that opened in a new way, and, 
                sniffing the leather, took a cigarette out of it. </p>
              <p> `No. Do you want anything?' Alexei Alexandrovich said reluctantly. 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, I wished... I wanted... Yes, I wanted to talk to you,' 
                said Stepan Arkadyevich, with surprise aware of an unaccustomed 
                timidity. </p>
              <p> This feeling was so unexpected and so strange that he did not 
                believe it was the voice of conscience telling him that what he 
                meant to do was wrong. Stepan Arkadyevich made an effort and struggled 
                with the timidity that had come over him. </p>
              <p> `I hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere 
                affection and respect for you,' he said, reddening. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich stood still and said nothing, but his face 
                struck Stepan Arkadyevich by its expression of an unresisting 
                sacrifice. </p>
              <p> `I intended... I wanted to have a little talk with you about 
                my sister and your mutual position,' he said, still struggling 
                with an unaccustomed constraint. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich smiled mournfully, looked at his brother-in-law, 
                and, without answering, went up to the table, took from it an 
                unfinished letter, and handed it to his brother-in-law. </p>
              <p> `I think unceasingly of the same thing. And here is what I had 
                begun writing, thinking I could say it better by letter, and that 
                my presence irritates her,' he said, as he gave him the letter. 
              </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich took the letter, looked with incredulous 
                surprise at the lusterless eyes fixed so immovably on him, and 
                began to read: </p>
              <p> `I see that my presence is irksome to you. Painful as it is 
                to me to believe it, I see that it is so, and cannot be otherwise. 
                I don't blame you, and God is my witness that on seeing you at 
                the time of your illness I resolved with my whole heart to forget 
                all that had passed between us, and to begin a new life. I do 
                not regret, and shall never regret, what I have done; but I have 
                desired one thing - your good, the good of your soul - and now 
                I see I have not attained that. Tell me yourself what will give 
                you true happiness and peace to your soul. I put myself entirely 
                in your hands, and trust to your feeling of what is right.' </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich handed back the letter, and, with the same 
                surprise, continued looking at his brother-in-law, not knowing 
                what to say. This silence was so awkward for both of them that 
                Stepan Arkadyevich's lips began twitching nervously, while he 
                still gazed without speaking at Karenin's face. </p>
              <p> `That's what I wanted to say to her,' said Alexei Alexandrovich, 
                turning away. </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes...' said Stepan Arkadyevich, not able to answer for 
                the tears that were choking him. `Yes, yes, I understand you,' 
                he brought out at last. </p>
              <p> `I want to know what she would like,' said Alexei Alexandrovich. 
              </p>
              <p> `I am afraid she does not understand her own position. She is 
                not a judge,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, recovering himself. `She 
                is crushed, simply crushed by your generosity. If she were to 
                read this letter, she would be incapable of saying anything - 
                she would only hang her head lower than ever.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, but what's to be done in that case? How explain... how 
                find out her wishes?' </p>
              <p> `If you will allow me to give my opinion, I think that it lies 
                with you to point out directly the steps you consider necessary 
                to end the situation.' </p>
              <p> `So you consider it must be ended?' Alexei Alexandrovich interrupted 
                him. `But how?' he added, with a gesture of his hands before his 
                eyes, not usual with him. `I see no possible way out of it.' </p>
              <p> `There is some way of getting out of every situation,' said 
                Stepan Arkadyevich, standing up and becoming more cheerful. `There 
                was a time when you thought of breaking off... If you are convinced 
                now that you cannot make each other happy...' </p>
              <p> `Happiness may be variously understood. But suppose that I agree 
                to everything, that I want nothing: what way is there of getting 
                out of our situation?' </p>
              <p> `If you care to know my opinion,' - said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                with the same smile of softening, almond-oil tenderness with which 
                he had been talking to Anna. His kindly smile was so winning that 
                Alexei Alexandrovich, feeling his own weakness and unconsciously 
                swayed by it, was ready to believe what Stepan Arkadyevich was 
                saying. `She will never speak out about it. But one thing is possible, 
                one thing she might desire,' he went on; `that is the cessation 
                of your relations, and all memories associated with them. To my 
                thinking, in your situation the essential thing is the formation 
                of a new attitude to one another. And that can only rest on a 
                basis of freedom on both sides.' </p>
              <p> `Divorce,' Alexei Alexandrovich interrupted, in a tone of aversion. 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, I imagine that divorce... Yes, divorce,' Stepan Arkadyevich 
                repeated, reddening. `That is from every point of view the most 
                rational course for married people who find themselves in the 
                situation you are in. What can be done if married people find 
                that life is impossible for them together? That may always happen.' 
              </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich sighed heavily and closed his eyes. </p>
              <p> `There's only one point to be considered: is either of the parties 
                desirous of forming new ties? If not, it is very simple,' said 
                Stepan Arkadyevich, feeling more and more free from constraint. 
              </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich, scowling with emotion, muttered something 
                to himself, and made no answer. All that seemed so simple to Stepan 
                Arkadyevich, Alexei Alexandrovich had thought over thousands of 
                times. And, so far from being simple, it all seemed to him utterly 
                impossible: divorce, the details of which he knew by this time, 
                seemed to him now out of the question, because the sense of his 
                own dignity and respect for religion forbade his taking upon himself 
                a fictitious charge of adultery, and still more, suffering his 
                wife, pardoned and beloved by him, to be caught in the fact and 
                put to public shame. Divorce appeared to him impossible also on 
                other, still more weighty grounds. </p>
              <p> What would become of his son in case of a divorce? To leave 
                him with his mother was out of the question. The divorced mother 
                would have her own illegitimate family, in which his status as 
                a stepson, and his education, would be probably bad. Keep him 
                with him? He knew that would be an act of vengeance on his part, 
                and that he did not desire. But, apart from this, what more than 
                all made divorce seem impossible to Alexei Alexandrovich was that, 
                by consenting to a divorce, he would be completely ruining Anna. 
                The saying of Darya Alexandrovna at Moscow, that in deciding on 
                a divorce he was thinking of himself, and not considering that 
                by this he would be ruining her irrevocably, had sunk into his 
                heart. And connecting this saying with his forgiveness of her, 
                with his devotion to the children, he understood it now in his 
                own way. To consent to a divorce, to give her her freedom, meant 
                in his thoughts to take from himself the last tie that bound him 
                to life - the children whom he loved; and to take from her the 
                last prop that kept her on the path of right, to thrust her down 
                to her ruin. If she were divorced, he knew she would join her 
                life to Vronsky's, and their tie would be an illegitimate and 
                criminal one, since a wife, by the interpretation of the ecclesiastical 
                law, could not marry while her husband was living. `She will join 
                him, and in a year or two he will throw her over, or she will 
                form a new tie,' thought Alexei Alexandrovich. `And I, by agreeing 
                to an unlawful divorce, shall be to blame for her ruin.' He had 
                thought it all over hundreds of times, and was convinced that 
                a divorce was not at all simple, as Stepan Arkadyevich had said, 
                but was utterly impossible. He did not believe a single word Stepan 
                Arkadyevich said to him; to every word he had a thousand objections 
                to make, but he listened to him, feeling that his words were the 
                expression of that mighty brutal force which controlled his life, 
                and to which he would have to submit. </p>
              <p> `The only question is on what terms you agree to give her a 
                divorce. She does not want anything, does not dare ask you for 
                anything - she leaves it all to your magnanimity.' </p>
              <p> `My God, my God! What for?' thought Alexei Alexandrovich, remembering 
                the details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took the 
                blame on himself, and with just the same gesture with which Vronsky 
                had done it, he hid his face in his hands in shame. </p>
              <p> `You are troubled, I understand that. But if you think it over...' 
              </p>
              <p> `'And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also 
                the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take 
                thy coat also,'' thought Alexei Alexandrovich. </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes!' he cried in a shrill voice. `I will take the disgrace 
                on myself, I will give up even my son, but... But wouldn't it 
                be better to let it alone? Still, you may do as you like....' 
              </p>
              <p> And, turning away so that his brother-in-law could not see him, 
                he sat down on a chair at the window. There was bitterness, there 
                was shame in his heart, but with bitterness and shame he felt 
                joy and emotion at the height of his own meekness. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich was touched. He was silent for a space. </p>
              <p> `Alexei Alexandrovich, believe me, she appreciates your magnanimity,' 
                he said. `But it seems it was the will of God,' he added, and 
                as he said it felt how foolish a remark it was, and with difficulty 
                repressed a smile at his own foolishness. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich would have made some reply, but tears stopped 
                him. </p>
              <p> `This is an unhappy fatality, and one must accept it as such. 
                I accept the calamity as an accomplished fact, and am doing my 
                best to help both her and you,' said Stepan Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> When he went out of his brother-in-law's room he was touched, 
                but that did not prevent him from being glad he had successfully 
                brought the matter to a conclusion, for he felt certain Alexei 
                Alexandrovich would not go back on his words. To this satisfaction 
                was added the fact that an idea had just struck him for a conundrum 
                turning on his successful achievement - when the affair was over 
                he would put it to his wife and most intimate friends. He tried 
                this conundrum in two or three different ways. `But I'll work 
                it out better than that,' he said to himself with a smile. </p>

              <p><br>
                Alexei Alexandrovich had seen nothing striking or improper in 
                the fact that his wife was sitting with Vronsky at a table apart, 
                in eager conversation with him about something. But he noticed 
                that to the rest of the party this appeared as something striking 
                and improper, and for that reason it seemed to him, too, to be 
                improper. He made up his mind that he must speak of it to his 
                wife. </p>
              <p>On reaching home Alexei Alexandrovich went to his study, as he 
                usually did, seated himself in his low chair, opened a book on 
                the Papacy at the place he had marked by inserting the paper knife, 
                read till one o'clock, just as he usually did. But from time to 
                time he would rub his high forehead and shake his head, as though 
                to drive away something. At his usual time he got up and made 
                his toilet for the night. Anna Arkadyevna had not yet come in. 
                With a book under his arm he went upstairs. But this evening, 
                instead of his usual thoughts and meditations upon official details, 
                his thoughts were absorbed by his wife and something disagreeable 
                connected with her. Contrary to his usual habit, he did not get 
                into bed, but fell to walking up and down the rooms with his hands 
                clasped behind his back. He could not go to bed, feeling that 
                it was absolutely needful for him first to think thoroughly over 
                the situation that had just arisen. </p>
              <p> When Alexei Alexandrovich had made up his mind that he must 
                have a talk with his wife, it had seemed a very easy and simple 
                matter. But now, when he began to think over the question that 
                had just presented itself, it seemed to him very complicated and 
                difficult. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich was not jealous. Jealousy, according to 
                his notions, was an insult to one's wife, and one ought to have 
                confidence in one's wife. Why one ought to have that confidence 
                - that is to say, a complete conviction that his young wife would 
                always love him - he did not ask himself. But he had never experienced 
                such a lack of confidence, because he had confidence in her, and 
                told himself that he ought to have it. Now, though his conviction 
                that jealousy was a shameful feeling, and that one ought to feel 
                confidence, had not broken down, he still felt that he was standing 
                face to face with something illogical and fatuous, and did not 
                know what ought to be done. Alexei Alexandrovich was standing 
                face to face with life, with the possibility of his wife's loving 
                someone other than himself, and this seemed to him very fatuous 
                and incomprehensible, because it was of the very stuff of life. 
                All his life Alexei Alexandrovich had lived and worked in official 
                spheres, having to do merely with the reflections of life. And 
                every time he had stumbled against life itself he had shrunk away 
                from it. Now he experienced a feeling akin to that of a man who, 
                while calmly crossing a precipice by a bridge, should suddenly 
                discover that the bridge is broken, and that there is a chasm 
                below. That chasm was life itself - the bridge, that artificial 
                life in which Alexei Alexandrovich had lived. For the first time 
                the question presented itself to him of the possibility of his 
                wife's loving someone else, and he was horrified at it. </p>
              <p> He did not undress, but walked up and down with his regular 
                tread over the resounding parquet of the dining room, where one 
                lamp was burning; over the carpet of the dark drawing room, in 
                which the light was reflected merely on the big new portrait of 
                himself hanging over the sofa; and across her boudoir, where two 
                candles burned, lighting up the portraits of her parents and feminine 
                friends, and the pretty knickknacks of her writing table, every 
                one of which he knew so well. He walked across her boudoir to 
                the bedroom door and turned back again. </p>
              <p> At each turn in his walk, especially on the parquet of the well-lit 
                dining room, he halted and said to himself, `Yes, this I must 
                decide and put a stop to; I must express my view of it and my 
                decision.' And he turned back again. `But just what shall I express? 
                And what decision?' he would say to himself in the drawing room 
                - and found no answer. `But, after all,' he asked himself before 
                turning into the boudoir,' what has occurred? Nothing. She was 
                talking a long while with him. But what of that? Surely women 
                in society can talk to whom they please. And then, jealousy means 
                debasing both her and myself,' he soliloquized as he entered her 
                boudoir; but this dictum, which had always had such weight with 
                him before, had now no weight and no meaning whatsoever. And from 
                the bedroom door he turned back again; but as he entered the dark 
                drawing room some inner voice told him that it was not so, and 
                that if others had noticed, it meant that there was something. 
                And he said to himself again in the dining room: `Yes, I must 
                decide and put a stop to it, and express my views....' And again 
                at the turn in the drawing room he asked himself: `Decide how?' 
                And again he asked inwardly: `What has occurred?' And answered: 
                `Nothing,' and recollected that jealousy was a feeling insulting 
                to his wife; but again in the drawing room he was convinced that 
                something had happened. His thoughts, like his body, were describing 
                a complete circle, without alighting upon anything new. He noticed 
                this, rubbed his forehead, and sat down in her boudoir. </p>
              <p> There, looking at her table, with the malachite blotting case 
                lying at the top, and an unfinished letter, his thoughts suddenly 
                changed. He began to think of her, of what her thoughts and emotions 
                must be. For the first time he pictured vividly to himself her 
                personal life, her ideas, her desires, and the thought that she 
                could and must have a separate life of her own seemed to him so 
                appalling that he made haste to drive it away. It was the chasm 
                which he was afraid to peep into. To put himself in thought and 
                feeling in another person's place was a spiritual action foreign 
                to Alexei Alexandrovich. He looked on this spiritual action as 
                a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy. </p>
              <p> `And the worst of it all,' thought he, `is that just now, at 
                the very moment when my great work is approaching completion' 
                (he was thinking of the project he was bringing forward at the 
                time), `when I stand in need of all my mental peace and all my 
                energies - just now this stupid worry has to come falling about 
                my ears. But what's to be done? I'm not one of those men who submit 
                to uneasiness and worry without having the force of character 
                to face them.' </p>
              <p> `I must think this over, come to a decision, and put it out 
                of my mind,' he said aloud. </p>
              <p> `The question of her feelings, of what has passed and may be 
                passing in her soul - that's not my affair; that's the affair 
                of her conscience, and falls under the head of religion,' he said 
                to himself, feeling consolation in the sense that he had found 
                to which division of regulating principles this new circumstance 
                could be properly referred. </p>
              <p> `And so,' Alexei Alexandrovich said to himself, `questions as 
                to her feelings, and so on, are questions for her conscience, 
                with which I can have nothing to do. My duty is clearly defined. 
                As the head of the family, I am a person bound in duty to guide 
                her, and, consequently, in part the person responsible; I am bound 
                to point out the danger I perceive, to warn her, even to use my 
                authority. I ought to speak plainly to her.' </p>
              <p> And everything that he would say tonight to his wife took clear 
                shape in Alexei Alexandrovich's head. Thinking over what he would 
                say, he somewhat regretted that he should have to use his time 
                and mental powers for domestic consumption, with so little to 
                show for it, but, in spite of that, the form and consistency of 
                the speech before him shaped itself as clearly and distinctly 
                in his head as a ministerial report. `I must speak on, and express 
                fully, the following points: first, an explanation of the value 
                to be attached to public opinion and to decorum; secondly, an 
                explanation of the religious significance of marriage; thirdly, 
                if need be, a reference to the calamity possibly ensuing to our 
                son; fourthly, a reference to the unhappiness likely to result 
                to herself.' And, interlacing his fingers, the palms downward, 
                Alexei Alexandrovich stretched his hands, and the joints of the 
                fingers cracked. </p>
              <p> This gesture, this bad habit - the joining of his hands cracking 
                his fingers, always soothed him, and gave precision to his thoughts, 
                so needful to him now. There was the sound of a carriage driving 
                up to the front door. Alexei Alexandrovich halted in the middle 
                of the room. </p>
              <p> A woman's step was heard mounting the stairs. Alexei Alexandrovich, 
                ready for his speech, stood squeezing his crossed fingers, waiting 
                for their crack to come again. One joint cracked. </p>
              <p> Already, from the sound of light steps on the stairs, he was 
                aware that she was close, and though he was satisfied with his 
                speech, he felt frightened because of the explanation confronting 
                him. </p>

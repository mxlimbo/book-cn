                On arriving in Moscow by a morning train, Levin had put up at 
                the house of his elder half-brother, Koznishev. After changing 
                his clothes he went down to his brother's study, intending to 
                talk to him at once about the object of his visit, and to ask 
                his advice; but his brother was not alone. With him there was 
                a well-known professor of philosophy, who had come from Charkov 
                expressly to clear up a difference that had arisen between them 
                on a very important philosophical question. The professor was 
                carrying on a hot crusade against materialists. Sergei Koznishev 
                had been following this crusade with interest, and after reading 
                the professor's last article had written him a letter stating 
                his objections. He accused the professor of making too great concessions 
                to the materialists. And the professor had promptly appeared to 
                argue the matter out. The point in discussion was the question 
                then in vogue: Is there a line to be drawn between psychical and 
                physiological phenomena in man? And if so, where? </p>
              <p>Sergei Ivanovich met his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness 
                he always had for everyone, and, introducing him to the professor, 
                went on with the conversation. </p>
              <p> A little man in spectacles, with a narrow forehead, tore himself 
                from the discussion for an instant to greet Levin, and then went 
                on talking without paying any further attention to him. Levin 
                sat down to wait till the professor should go, but he soon began 
                to get interested in the subject under discussion. </p>
              <p> Levin had come across the magazine articles about which they 
                were disputing, and had read them, interested in them as a development 
                of the first principles of science, familiar to him when a natural 
                science student at the university. But he had never connected 
                these scientific deductions as to the origin of man as an animal, 
                as to reflex action, biology and sociology, with those questions 
                as to the meaning to himself of life and death, which had of late 
                been more and more often in his mind. </p>
              <p> As he listened to his brother's argument with the professor, 
                he noticed that they connected these scientific questions with 
                those spiritual problems - that at times they almost touched on 
                the latter; but every time they were close upon what seemed to 
                him the chief point they promptly beat a hasty retreat, and plunged 
                again into a sea of subtle distinctions, reservations, quotations, 
                allusions and appeals to authorities, and it was with difficulty 
                that he understood what they were talking about. </p>
              <p> `I cannot admit it,' said Sergei Ivanovich, with his habitual 
                clearness and distinctness of expression, and elegance of diction. 
                `I cannot in any case agree with Keiss that my whole conception 
                of the external world has been derived from impressions. The most 
                fundamental idea - the idea of existence - has not been received 
                by me through sensation; indeed, there is no special sense organ 
                for the transmission of such an idea.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, but they - Wurst, and Knaust, and Pripassov - would answer 
                that your consciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction 
                of all your sensations, that that consciousness of existence is 
                the result of your sensations. Wurst, indeed, says plainly that, 
                assuming there are no sensations, it follows that there is no 
                idea of existence.' </p>
              <p> `I maintain the contrary,' began Sergei Ivanovich. </p>
              <p> But here it seemed again to Levin that, just as they were close 
                upon the real point of the matter, they were again retreating, 
                and he made up his mind to put a question to the professor. </p>
              <p> `According to that, if my senses are annihilated, if my body 
                is dead, I can have no existence of any sort?' he queried. </p>
              <p> The professor, in annoyance, and, as it were, mental suffering 
                at the interruption, looked round at the strange inquirer, more 
                like a hauler of a barge than a philosopher, and turned his eyes 
                upon Sergei Ivanovich, as though to ask: What's one to say to 
                him? But Sergei Ivanovich, who had been talking with far less 
                stress and one-sidedness than the professor, and who had sufficient 
                breadth of mind to answer the professor, and at the same time 
                to comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which 
                the question was put, smiled and said: </p>
              <p> `That question we have no right to answer as yet....' </p>
              <p> `We have not the requisite data,' confirmed the professor, and 
                he went back to his argument. `No,' he said; `I would point out 
                the fact that if, as Pripassov directly asserts, sensation is 
                based on impression, then we are bound to distinguish sharply 
                between these two conceptions.' </p>
              <p> Levin listened no more, and simply waited for the professor 
                to go. </p>
              <p> </p>

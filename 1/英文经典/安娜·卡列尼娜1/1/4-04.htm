              <p><br>
                Alexei Alexandrovich, after meeting Vronsky on his own steps, 
                drove, as he had intended, to the Italian opera. He sat through 
                two acts there, and saw everyone he wanted to see. On returning 
                home, he carefully scrutinized the hatstand, and noticing that 
                there was not a military overcoat there, he went, as usual, to 
                his own room. But, contrary to his usual habit, he did not go 
                to bed; he walked up and down his study till three o'clock in 
                the morning. The feeling of furious anger with his wife, who would 
                not observe the proprieties and keep to the one stipulation he 
                had laid on her - not to receive her lover in her own house - 
                gave him no peace. She had not complied with his request, and 
                he was bound to punish her and carry out his threat - obtain a 
                divorce and take away his son. He knew all the difficulties connected 
                with this course, but he had said he would do it, and now he must 
                carry out his threat. Countess Lidia Ivanovna had hinted that 
                this was the best way out of his position, and of late the obtaining 
                of divorces had been brought to such a pitch of perfection that 
                Alexei Alexandrovich saw a possibility of overcoming the formal 
                difficulties. Misfortunes never come singly, and the affairs of 
                the reorganization of the native tribes, and of the irrigation 
                of the lands of the Zaraisky province, had brought such official 
                worries upon Alexei Alexandrovich that he had been of late in 
                a continual state of extreme irritability. </p>
              <p>He did not sleep the whole night, and his fury growing in a sort 
                of vast, arithmetical progression, reached its highest limits 
                in the morning. He dressed in haste, and, as though carrying his 
                cup full of wrath, and fearing to spill any over, fearing to lose 
                with his wrath the energy necessary for the interview with his 
                wife, he went into her room directly he heard she was up. </p>
              <p> Anna, who had thought she knew her husband so well, was amazed 
                at his appearance when he went in to her. His brow was lowering 
                and his eyes stared darkly before him, avoiding her eyes; his 
                mouth was tightly and contemptuously shut. In his walk, in his 
                gestures, in the sound of his voice there was a determination 
                and firmness such as his wife had never seen in him. He went into 
                her room, and, without greeting her, walked straight up to her 
                writing table, and, taking her keys, opened a drawer. </p>
              <p> `What do you want?' she cried. </p>
              <p> `Your lover's letters,' he said. </p>
              <p> `They're not here,' she said, shutting the drawer; but from 
                that action he saw he had guessed right, and roughly pushing away 
                her hand, he quickly snatched a portfolio in which he knew she 
                used to put her most important papers. She tried to pull the portfolio 
                away, but he pushed her back. </p>
              <p> `Sit down! I have to speak to you,' he said, putting the portfolio 
                under his arm, and squeezing it so tightly with his elbow that 
                his shoulder stood up. </p>
              <p> Amazed and intimidated, she gazed at him in silence. </p>
              <p> `I told you that I would not allow you to receive your lover 
                in this house.' </p>
              <p> `I had to see him to...' </p>
              <p> She stopped, not finding a reason. </p>
              <p> `I do not enter into the details of why a woman wants to see 
                her lover.' </p>
              <p> `I meant, I only...' she said, flushing hotly. This coarseness 
                of his angered her, and gave her courage. `Surely you must feel 
                how easy it is for you to insult me?' she said. </p>
              <p> `An honest man and an honest woman may be insulted, but to tell 
                a thief he's a thief is simply la constatation d'un fait.' </p>
              <p> `This cruelty is something new - I did not know in you.' </p>
              <p> `You call it cruelty for a husband to give his wife liberty, 
                giving her the honorable protection of his name, simply on the 
                condition of observing the proprieties: is that cruelty?' </p>
              <p> `It's worse that cruel - it's base, if you want to know!' Anna 
                cried, in a rush of hatred, and, getting up, she was about to 
                leave the room. </p>
              <p> `No!' he shrieked in his shrill voice, which pitched a note 
                even higher than usual, and his big hands clutching her by the 
                arm so violently that red marks were left from the bracelet he 
                was squeezing, he forcibly made her sit down in her place. `Base! 
                If you care to use that word, what is base is to forsake husband 
                and child for a lover, while you eat your husband's bread!' </p>
              <p> She bowed her head. She did not say what she had said the evening 
                before to her lover, that he was her husband, and her husband 
                was superfluous; she did not even think of that. She felt all 
                the justice of his words, and only said softly: </p>
              <p> `You cannot describe my position as worse than I feel it to 
                be myself; but what are you saying all this for?' </p>
              <p> `What am I saying it for? What for?' he went on, as angrily. 
                `So that you may know that, since you have not carried out my 
                wishes in regard to observing outward decorum, I will take measures 
                to put an end to this state of things.' </p>
              <p> `Soon, very soon, it will end, anyway,' she said; and again, 
                at the thought of death near at hand and now desired, tears came 
                into her eyes. </p>
              <p> `It will end sooner than you and your lover have planned! If 
                you must have the satisfaction of animal passion...' </p>
              <p> `Alexei Alexandrovich! I won't say it's not generous, but it's 
                not like a gentleman to strike anyone who's down.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, you only think of yourself! But the sufferings of a man 
                who was your husband have no interest for you. You don't care 
                that his whole life is ruined, that he is seff... seff...' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich was speaking so quickly that he began to 
                stammer, and was utterly unable to articulate the word `suffering'. 
                In the end he pronounced it `saffering'. She wanted to laugh, 
                and was immediately ashamed that anything could amuse her at such 
                a moment. And for the first time, for an instant, she felt for 
                him, put herself in his place, and was sorry for him. But what 
                could she say or do? Her head sank, and she sat silent. He too 
                was silent for some time, and then began speaking in a frigid, 
                less shrill voice, emphasizing random words that had no special 
                significance. </p>
              <p> I came to tell you...' he said. </p>
              <p> She glanced at him. `No; it was my fancy,' she thought, recalling 
                the expression of his face when he stumbled over the word `suffering.' 
                `No; can a man with those dull eyes, with that self-satisfied 
                complacency, feel anything?' </p>
              <p> `I cannot change anything,' she whispered. </p>
              <p> `I have come to tell you that I am going tomorrow to Moscow, 
                and shall not return again to this house, and you will receive 
                notice of what I decide through the lawyer into whose hands I 
                shall entrust the task of getting a divorce. My son is going to 
                my sister's,' said Alexei Alexandrovich, with an effort recalling 
                what he had meant to say about his son. </p>
              <p> `You take Seriozha to hurt me,' she said, looking at him from 
                under her brows. `You do not love him.... Leave me Seriozha!' 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, I have lost even my affection for my son, because he is 
                associated with the repulsion I feel for you. But still I shall 
                take him. Good-by!' </p>
              <p> And he was going away, but now she detained him. </p>
              <p> `Alexei Alexandrovich, leave me Seriozha!' she whispered once 
                more. `I have nothing else to say. Leave Seriozha till my... I 
                shall soon be confined; leave him!' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich flared up, and, snatching his hand from 
                her, he went out of the room without a word. </p>

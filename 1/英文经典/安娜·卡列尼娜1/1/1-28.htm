              <p><br>
                After the ball, early next morning, Anna Arkadyevna sent her husband 
                a telegram that she was leaving Moscow the same day. </p>
              <p>`No, I must go, I must go'; she explained the change in her plans 
                to her sister-in-law, in a tone that suggested that she had to 
                remember so many things that there was no enumerating them: `no, 
                really, it had better be today!' </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich was not dining at home, but he promised to 
                come and see his sister off at seven o'clock. </p>
              <p> Kitty, too, did not come, sending a note that she had a headache. 
                Dolly and Anna dined alone with the children and the English governess. 
                Whether it was because children are fickle, or because they have 
                acute senses, and they felt that Anna was quite different that 
                day from what she had been when they had taken such a fancy to 
                her, that she was not now interested in them - they had abruptly 
                dropped their play with their aunt, and their love for her, and 
                were quite indifferent to her leaving. Anna was absorbed the whole 
                morning in preparations for her departure. She wrote notes to 
                her Moscow acquaintances, jotted down her accounts, and packed. 
                Altogether Dolly fancied she was not in a placid state of mind, 
                but in that worried mood which Dolly knew so well in her own case, 
                and which does not come without cause, and for the most part covers 
                dissatisfaction with oneself. After dinner, Anna went up to her 
                room to dress, and Dolly followed her. </p>
              <p> `How queer you are today!' Dolly said to her. </p>
              <p> `I? Do you think so? I'm not queer, but I'm nasty. I am like 
                that sometimes. I keep feeling as if I could cry. It's very stupid, 
                but it'll pass off,' said Anna quickly, and she bent her flushed 
                face over a tiny bag in which she was packing a nightcap and some 
                cambric handkerchiefs. Her eyes were particularly bright, and 
                were continually dimmed with tears. `In the same way I didn't 
                want to leave Peterburg - and now I don't want to go away from 
                here.' </p>
              <p> `You came here and did a good deed,' said Dolly, looking intently 
                at her. </p>
              <p> Anna's eyes were wet with tears as she looked at her. </p>
              <p> `Don't say that, Dolly. I've done nothing, and could do nothing. 
                I often wonder why people are all in league to spoil me. What 
                have I done, and what could I do? In your heart there was found 
                love enough to forgive....' </p>
              <p> If it had not been for you, God knows what would have happened! 
                How happy you are, Anna!' said Dolly. `Everything is clear and 
                good in your heart.' </p>
              <p> `Every heart has its own skeleton, as the English say.' </p>
              <p> `You have no sort of skeleton, have you? Everything is so clear 
                in you.' </p>
              <p> `I have!' said Anna suddenly, and, unexpectedly after her tears, 
                a sly, mocking smile puckered her lips. </p>
              <p> `Come, he's amusing, anyway, your skeleton, and not depressing,' 
                said Dolly, smiling. </p>
              <p> `No, he is depressing. Do you know why I'm going today instead 
                of tomorrow? This is a confession that weighs on me; I want to 
                make you its recipient,' said Anna resolutely letting herself 
                drop into an armchair, and looking straight into Dolly's face. 
              </p>
              <p> And to her surprise Dolly saw that Anna was blushing up to her 
                ears, up to the curly black ringlets on her neck. </p>
              <p> `Yes,' Anna went on. `Do you know why Kitty didn't come to dinner? 
                She's jealous of me. I have spoiled... I've been the cause of 
                that ball being a torture to her instead of a pleasure. But truly, 
                truly, it's not my fault, or only my fault a little bit,' she 
                said, daintily drawling the words `a little bit.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, how like Stiva you said that!' said Dolly, laughing. </p>
              <p> Anna was hurt. </p>
              <p> `Oh no, oh no! I'm not Stiva,' she said, knitting her brows. 
                `That's why I'm telling you, just because I do not even for an 
                instant permit myself to doubt about myself,' said Anna. </p>
              <p> But at the very moment she was uttering the words, she felt 
                that they were not true. She was not merely doubting about herself 
                - she felt emotion at the thought of Vronsky, and was going away 
                sooner than she had meant, solely to avoid meeting him. </p>
              <p> `Yes, Stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him, and that 
                he...' </p>
              <p> `You can't imagine how absurdly it all came about. I only meant 
                to be matchmaking, and all at once it turned out quite differently. 
                Possibly against my own will...' </p>
              <p> She flushed and stopped. </p>
              <p> `Oh, they feel it immediately!' said Dolly. </p>
              <p> `But I should be in despair if there were anything serious in 
                it on his side,' Anna interrupted her. `And I'm certain it will 
                all be forgotten, and Kitty will leave off hating me.' </p>
              <p> `All the same, Anna, to tell you the truth, I'm not very anxious 
                for this marriage for Kitty. And it's better it should come to 
                nothing, if he, Vronsky, is capable of falling in love with you 
                in a single day.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, heavens, that would be too silly!' said Anna, and again 
                a deep flush of pleasure appeared on her face, as she heard the 
                idea that absorbed her put into words. `And so here I am, going 
                away, having made an enemy of Kitty, whom I liked so much! Ah, 
                how sweet she is! But you'll make it right, Dolly? Eh?' </p>
              <p> Dolly could scarcely suppress a smile. She loved Anna, but she 
                was pleased to see that she, too, had her weaknesses. </p>
              <p> `An enemy? That can't be.' </p>
              <p> `I did so want you all to care for me, as I do for you, and 
                now I care for you more than ever,' said Anna, with tears in her 
                eyes. `Ah, how silly I am today!' </p>
              <p> She passed her handkerchief over her face and began dressing. 
              </p>
              <p> At the very moment of starting Stepan Arkadyevich arrived, late, 
                rosy and good-humored, smelling of wine and cigars. </p>
              <p> Anna's emotionalism infected Dolly, and when she embraced her 
                sister-in-law for the last time, she whispered: </p>
              <p> `Remember, Anna, what you've done for me - I shall never forget. 
                And remember that I love you, and shall always love you as my 
                dearest friend!' </p>
              <p> `I don't know why,' said Anna, kissing her and hiding her tears. 
              </p>
              <p> `You understand me, and still understand. Good-by, my darling!' 
              </p>

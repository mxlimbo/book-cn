              <p><br>
                Princess Betsy drove home from the theater without waiting for 
                the end of the last act. She had just time enough to go into her 
                dressing room, sprinkle her long, pale face with powder, rub it 
                off, set her dress to rights, and order tea in the big drawing 
                room, when one after another carriages drove up to her huge house 
                on the Bolshaia Morskaia. Her guests dismounted at the wide entrance, 
                and the stout porter, who used to read newspapers mornings behind 
                the glass door, to the edification of the passers-by, noiselessly 
                opened the immense door, letting the visitors pass by him into 
                the house. </p>
              <p>Almost at the same instant that the hostess, with freshly arranged 
                coiffure and freshened face, entered at one door, her guests entered 
                at the other, into the drawing room, a large room with dark walls, 
                downy rugs and a brightly lighted table, gleaming with the light 
                of candles, the whiteness of napery, the silver of the samovar 
                and the tea service of transparent porcelain. </p>
              <p> The hostess sat down at the samovar and took off her gloves. 
                Chairs were set with the aid of footmen, moving almost imperceptibly 
                about the room; the party settled itself, divided into two groups: 
                one round the samovar near the hostess, the other at the opposite 
                end of the drawing room, round the handsome wife of an ambassador, 
                in black velvet, with sharply defined black eyebrows. In both 
                groups conversation wavered, as it always does, for the first 
                few minutes, broken up by meetings, salutations, offers of tea, 
                and, as it were, seeking for some point in common. </p>
              <p> `She's exceptionally fine as an actress; one can see she's studied 
                Kaulbach,' said a diplomatist in the circle of the ambassador's 
                wife. `Did you notice how she fell down?...' </p>
              <p> `Oh, please, don't let us talk about Nilsson! No one can possibly 
                say anything new about her,' said a fat, red-faced, flaxen-headed 
                lady, without eyebrows and without chignon, wearing an old silk 
                dress. This was Princess Miaghkaia, noted for her simplicity and 
                the roughness of her manners, and nicknamed enfant terrible. Princess 
                Miaghkaia was seated halfway between the two groups, and, listening 
                to both, took part in the conversation first of one and then of 
                the other. `Three people have used that very phrase about Kaulbach 
                to me today, just as though they had conspired. And I don't know 
                why that phrase should be so much to their liking.' </p>
              <p> The conversation was cut short by this observation, and again 
                a new subject had to be thought of. </p>
              <p> `Do tell us something amusing, yet not spiteful,' said the ambassador's 
                wife, a great proficient in the art of that elegant conversation 
                called by the English small talk. She addressed the diplomatist, 
                who was now at a loss just what to begin upon. </p>
              <p> `That is said to be a difficult task - only that which is spiteful 
                is supposed to be amusing,' he began with a smile. `However, I'll 
                make the attempt. Give me a theme. it's all a matter of the theme. 
                If the theme be but given, it's easy enough to embroider it. I 
                often think that the celebrated conversationalists of the last 
                century would find it difficult to talk cleverly now. Everything 
                clever has become such a bore....' </p>
              <p> `That has been said long ago,' the ambassador's wife interrupted 
                him, laughing. </p>
              <p> The conversation had begun amiably, but just because it was 
                too amiable, it came to a stop again. They had to have recourse 
                to the sure, never-failing remedy - malicious gossip. </p>
              <p> `Don't you think there's something Louis Quinze about Tushkevich?' 
                he said, glancing toward a handsome, fair-haired young man, standing 
                at the table. </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes! He's in the same style as the drawing room, and that's 
                why it is he's so often here.' </p>
              <p> This conversation was kept up, since it depended on allusions 
                to what could not be talked of in that room - that is to say, 
                of the relations of Tushkevich with their hostess. </p>
              <p> Round the samovar and the hostess the conversation having, in 
                the meanwhile, vacillated in precisely the same way between the 
                three inevitable topics - the latest piece of public news, the 
                theater, and censuring the fellow creature - had finally come 
                to rest on the last topic - that is, malicious gossip. </p>
              <p> `Have you heard that even the Maltishcheva - the mother, not 
                the daughter - has ordered a costume in diable rose color?' </p>
              <p> `Impossible! No, that's just charming!' </p>
              <p> `I wonder that with her sense - for after all she's no fool 
                - she doesn't see how funny she is.' </p>
              <p> Every one had something to say in censure or ridicule of the 
                hapless Maltishcheva, and the conversation crackled merrily, like 
                a blazing bonfire. </p>
              <p> The husband of Princess Betsy, a good-natured corpulent man, 
                an ardent collector of engravings, hearing that his wife had visitors, 
                had come into the drawing room before leaving for his club. Stepping 
                noiselessly over the thick rugs, he approached Princess Miaghkaia. 
              </p>
              <p> `How did you like Nilsson?' he asked. </p>
              <p> `Oh, how can you steal up on anyone like that! How you startled 
                me!' she responded. `Please don't talk to me about the opera; 
                you know nothing about music. I'd rather come down to your own 
                level, and discuss with you your majolica and engravings. Come, 
                now, what treasure have you been buying lately at the rag fair?' 
              </p>
              <p> `Would you like me to show you? But you don't understand such 
                things.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, show me. I've been learning about them at those - what's 
                their names?... those bankers... They have some splendid engravings. 
                They showed them to us.' </p>
              <p> `Why, have you been at the Schutzburgs?' asked the hostess from 
                behind the samovar. </p>
              <p> `Yes, ma ch¨¨re. They asked my husband and myself to dinner, 
                and I was told that the sauce at that dinner cost a thousand roubles,' 
                Princess Miaghkaia said, speaking loudly, conscious that all were 
                listening; `and very nasty sauce it was - some green mess. We 
                had to ask them, and I made a sauce for eighty-five kopecks, and 
                everybody was very much pleased with it. I can't afford thousand-rouble 
                sauces.' </p>
              <p> `She's unique!' said the lady of the house. </p>
              <p> `Amazing!' somebody else added. </p>
              <p> The effect produced by Princess Miaghkaia's speeches was always 
                the same, and the secret of the effect she produced lay in the 
                fact that though she spoke not always appropriately, as now, she 
                said homely truths, not devoid of sense. In the society in which 
                she lived such utterances had the same result as the most pungent 
                wit. Princess Miaghkaia could never see why it had that result, 
                but she knew it had, and took advantage of it. </p>
              <p> Since everyone had been listening while Princess Miaghkaia spoke, 
                and the conversation around the ambassador's wife had dropped, 
                Princess Betsy tried to bring the whole party together, and she 
                addressed the ambassador's wife. </p>
              <p> `Really won't you have tea? Do come and join us.' </p>
              <p> `No, we're very comfortable here,' the ambassador's wife responded 
                with a smile, and went on with the interrupted conversation. </p>
              <p> It was a most agreeable conversation. They were censuring the 
                Karenins, husband and wife. </p>
              <p> `Anna is quite changed since her stay in Moscow. There's something 
                strange about her,' said one of her feminine friends. </p>
              <p> `The great change is that she has brought back with her the 
                shadow of Alexei Vronsky,' said the ambassador's wife. </p>
              <p> `Well, what of it? There's a fable of Grimm's about a man without 
                a shadow - a man deprived of his shadow. As a punishment for something 
                or other. I never could understand just how this was a punishment. 
                Yet a woman must probably feel uncomfortable without a shadow.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, but women followed by a shadow usually come to a bad end,' 
                said Anna's friend. </p>
              <p> `Bite your tongue!' said Princess Miaghkaia suddenly. `Karenina 
                is a splendid woman. I don't like her husband - but her I like 
                very much.' </p>
              <p> `Why don't you like her husband? He's such a remarkable man,' 
                said the ambassador's wife. `My husband says there are few statesmen 
                like him in Europe.' </p>
              <p> `And my husband tells me just the same, but I don't believe 
                it,' said Princess Miaghkaia. `If our husbands didn't talk to 
                us, we should see the facts as they are. Alexei Alexandrovich, 
                to my thinking, is simply a fool. I say it in a whisper.... But 
                doesn't it really make everything clear? Before, when I was told 
                to consider him clever, I kept looking for his ability, and thought 
                myself a fool for not seeing it; but directly I said, he's a fool, 
                though only in a whisper, everything became clear - isn't that 
                so?' </p>
              <p> `How spiteful you are today!' </p>
              <p> `Not a bit. I'd no other way out of it. One of us two had to 
                be the fool. And, as you know, one could never say that of oneself.' 
              </p>
              <p> `No one is satisfied with his fortune, and everyone is satisfied 
                with his wit,' the diplomatist repeated the French saying. </p>
              <p> `That's it - that's just it,' Princess Miaghkaia turned to him 
                promptly. `But the point is that I won't abandon Anna to your 
                mercies. She's such a dear, so charming. How can she help it if 
                they're all in love with her, and follow her about like shadows?' 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, I had no idea of censuring her,' Anna's friend said in 
                self-defense. </p>
              <p> `If we have no shadows following us, it does not prove that 
                we've any right to blame her.' </p>
              <p> And, having duly disposed of Anna's friend, the Princess Miaghkaia 
                got up, and, together with the ambassador's wife, joined the group 
                at the table, where the general conversation had to do with the 
                king of Prussia. </p>
              <p> `What were you gossiping so maliciously about?' asked Betsy. 
              </p>
              <p> `About the Karenins. The Princess gave us a character sketch 
                of Alexei Alexandrovich,' said the ambassador's wife with a smile, 
                as she sat down at the table. </p>
              <p> `Pity we didn't hear it!' said Princess Betsy, glancing toward 
                the door. `Ah, here you are at last!' she said, turning with a 
                smile to Vronsky who was entering. </p>
              <p> Vronsky was not merely acquainted with all the persons whom 
                he was meeting here; he saw them all every day; and so he came 
                in with the quiet manner with which one enters a room full of 
                people whom one had left only a short while ago. </p>
              <p> `Where do I come from?' he repeated the question of the ambassador's 
                wife. `Well, there's no help for it - I must confess. From the 
                opera bouffe. I do believe I've seen it a hundred times, and always 
                with fresh enjoyment. It's exquisite! I know it's disgraceful, 
                but I go to sleep at the opera, yet I sit out the opera bouffe 
                to the last minute, and enjoy it. This evening...' </p>
              <p> He mentioned a French actress, and was about to tell something 
                about her; but the ambassador's wife, with playful trepidation, 
                cut him short. </p>
              <p> `Please, don't tell us about that horror.' </p>
              <p> `Very well, I won't - especially as everyone knows those horrors.' 
              </p>
              <p> `And we should all go to see them if it were accepted as the 
                correct thing, like the opera,' chimed in Princess Miaghkaia. 
              </p>

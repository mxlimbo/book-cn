                `So you see,' pursued Nikolai Levin, painfully wrinkling his forehead 
                and twitching. </p>
              <p>It was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and 
                do. </p>
              <p> `Here, do you see?... He pointed to some sort of short iron 
                bars, fastened together with twine, lying in a corner of the room. 
                `Do you see that? That's the beginning of a new enterprise we're 
                going into. This enterprise will be an industrial association....' 
              </p>
              <p> Konstantin scarcely heard him. He looked into his sickly, consumptive 
                face, and he was more and more sorry for him, and he could not 
                force himself to listen to what his brother was telling him about 
                the association. He saw that this association was a mere anchor 
                to save him from self-contempt. Nikolai Levin went on talking: 
              </p>
              <p> `You know that capital oppresses the worker. Our workers, the 
                mouzhiks, bear all the burden of labor, and are so placed that, 
                no matter how much they work, they can't escape from their position 
                of beasts of burden. All the profits of labor, on which they might 
                improve their position, and gain leisure for themselves, and after 
                that education - all the surplus values, are taken from them by 
                the capitalists. And society is so constituted that the harder 
                they work, the greater the profit of the merchants and landowners, 
                while they stay beasts of burden to the end. And that state of 
                things must be changed,' he finished up, and looked questioningly 
                at his brother. </p>
              <p> `Yes, of course,' said Konstantin, looking at the patch of red 
                that had come out on his brother's projecting cheekbones. </p>
              <p> `And so we're founding a locksmith's association, where all 
                the production and profit, and the chief instruments of production 
                - everything - will be in common.' </p>
              <p> `Where is the association to be?' asked Konstantin Levin. </p>
              <p> `In the village of Vozdrem, government of Kazan.' </p>
              <p> `But why in a village? In the villages, I think, there is plenty 
                of work as it is. Why a locksmith's association in a village?' 
              </p>
              <p> `Why? Because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever 
                were, and that's why you and Sergei Ivanovich don't like people 
                to try and get them out of their slavery,' said Nikolai Levin, 
                exasperated by the objection. </p>
              <p> Konstantin Levin sighed, looking meanwhile about the cheerless 
                and dirty room. This sigh seemed to exasperate Nikolai still more. 
              </p>
              <p> `I know Sergei Ivanovich's, and your, aristocratic views. I 
                know that he applies all the power of his intellect to justify 
                existing evils.' </p>
              <p> `I say, why do you talk of Sergei Ivanovich?' Levin let drop, 
                smiling. </p>
              <p> `Sergei Ivanovich? I'll tell you why!' Nikolai Levin shrieked 
                suddenly at the name of Sergei Ivanovich. `I'll tell you why... 
                But what's the use of talking? There's only one thing... What 
                did you come to me for? You look down on all this; very well, 
                then; but go away, in God's name - go away!' he shrieked, getting 
                up from his chair. `Go away - go away!' </p>
              <p> `I don't look down on it at all,' said Konstantin Levin timidly. 
                `I don't even dispute it.' </p>
              <p> At that instant Marya Nikolaevna came back. Nikolai Levin looked 
                round angrily at her. She went quickly to him, and whispered something. 
              </p>
              <p> `I'm not well; I've grown irritable,' said Nikolai Levin, getting 
                calmer and breathing painfully; `and then you talk to me of Sergei 
                Ivanovich and his essay. It's such rubbish, such lying, such self-deception! 
                What can a man write about justice who knows nothing of it? Have 
                you read his essay?' he turned to Kritsky, sitting down again 
                at the table, and clearing a space for himself by pushing back 
                some half-made cigarettes. </p>
              <p> `I haven't,' Kritsky responded gloomily, obviously not desiring 
                to enter into the conversation. </p>
              <p> `Why not?' said Nikolai Levin, now turning with exasperation 
                upon Kritsky. </p>
              <p> `Because I didn't see the use of wasting my time over it.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, if you please - how did you know it would be wasting your 
                time? That essay's too deep for many people - that is to say, 
                it's over their heads. But it's different with me, I see through 
                his ideas, and I know wherein the essay's weakness lies.' </p>
              <p> They all fell silent. Kritsky got up sluggishly and reached 
                for his cap. </p>
              <p> `Won't you have supper? All right, good-by! Come round tomorrow 
                with the locksmith.' </p>
              <p> Kritsky had hardly gone out when Nikolai Levin smiled and winked. 
              </p>
              <p> `He, too, is poor stuff,' he said. `For I can see...' </p>
              <p> But at that instant Kritsky, at the door, called him. </p>
              <p> `What do you want now?' he said, and went out to him in the 
                passage. Left alone with Marya Nikolaevna, Levin turned to her. 
              </p>
              <p> `Have you been long with my brother?' he said to her. </p>
              <p> `Yes, more than a year. His health has become very poor. He 
                drinks a great deal,' she said. </p>
              <p> `Just how?' </p>
              <p> `He drinks vodka, and it's bad for him.' </p>
              <p> `And a great deal?' whispered Levin. </p>
              <p> `Yes,' she said, looking timidly toward the doorway, where Nikolai 
                Levin had reappeared. </p>
              <p> `What were you talking about?' he said, knitting his brows, 
                and turning his scared eyes from one to the other. `What was it?' 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, nothing,' Konstantin answered in confusion. </p>
              <p> `Oh, if you don't want to say, don't. Only it's no good your 
                talking to her. She's a wench, and you're a gentleman,' he said, 
                with a jerk of the neck. `You understand everything, I see, and 
                have taken stock of everything, and look with commiseration on 
                my transgressions,' he began again, raising his voice. </p>
              <p> `Nikolai Dmitrich, Nikolai Dmitrich,' whispered Marya Nikolaevna, 
                again going up to him. </p>
              <p> `Oh, very well, very well!... But where's the supper? Ah, here 
                it is,' he said, seeing a waiter with a tray. `Here, set it here,' 
                he added angrily, and promptly seizing the vodka, he poured out 
                a pony and drank it greedily. `Like a drink?' he turned to his 
                brother, and at once became better-humored. `Well, enough of Sergei 
                Ivanovich. I'm glad to see you, anyway. After all's said and done, 
                we're not strangers. Come, have a drink. Tell me what you're doing,' 
                he went on, greedily munching a piece of bread, and pouring out 
                another pony. `How are things with you?' </p>
              <p> `I live alone in the country, as I always have. I'm busy looking 
                after the land,' answered Konstantin, watching with horror the 
                greediness with which his brother ate and drank, and trying to 
                conceal that he noticed it. </p>
              <p> `Why don't you get married?' </p>
              <p> `No opportunity has presented itself,' Konstantin answered, 
                reddening. </p>
              <p> `Why not? For me now, everything's at an end! I've made a mess 
                of my life. But this I've said, and I say still, that if my share 
                had been given me when I needed it, my whole life would have been 
                different.' </p>
              <p> Konstantin made haste to change the conversation. </p>
              <p> `Do you know your little Vania's with me - a clerk in the countinghouse 
                at Pokrovskoe?' </p>
              <p> Nikolai jerked his neck, and sank into thought. </p>
              <p> `Yes, tell me what's going on at Pokrovskoe. Is the house still 
                standing, and the birch trees, and our schoolroom? And Philip 
                the gardener - is he living? How I remember the summerhouse and 
                the sofa! Now mind and don't alter anything in the house, but 
                make haste and get married, and make everything as it used to 
                be again. Then I'll come and see you, if your wife is a fine woman.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Why, come to me now,' said Levin. `How snugly we could settle 
                down!' </p>
              <p> `I'd come and see you if I were sure I shouldn't find Sergei 
                Ivanovich.' </p>
              <p> `You wouldn't find him there. I live quite independently of 
                him.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, but say what you like, you have to choose between me and 
                him,' he said, looking timidly into his brother's face. </p>
              <p> This timidity touched Konstantin. </p>
              <p> `If you want to hear my confession of faith on the subject, 
                I tell you that in your quarrel with Sergei Ivanovich I take neither 
                side. You're both wrong. You're rather wrong outwardly, and he, 
                rather inwardly.' </p>
              <p> `Ah, ah! You see that, you see that!' Nikolai shouted joyfully. 
              </p>
              <p> `But I personally value friendly relations with you more because...' 
              </p>
              <p> `Why, why?' </p>
              <p> Konstantin could not say that he valued it more because Nikolai 
                was unhappy, and needed affection. But Nikolai knew that this 
                was just what he meant to say, and scowling he took to the vodka 
                again. </p>
              <p> `Enough, Nikolai Dmitrich!' said Marya Nikolaevna, stretching 
                out her plump, bare arm toward the decanter. </p>
              <p> `Let it be! Don't annoy me! I'll beat you!' he shouted. </p>
              <p> Marya Nikolaevna smiled a sweet and good-humored smile, which 
                was at once reflected on Nikolai's face, and whisked the decanter 
                off. </p>
              <p> `And do you suppose she understands nothing?' said Nikolai. 
                `She understands everything better than all of us. Tell the truth 
                - isn't there something good and sweet about her?' </p>
              <p> `Were you never before in Moscow?' Konstantin said to her, for 
                the sake of saying something. </p>
              <p> `Only you mustn't be formal with her. It frightens her. No one 
                ever spoke to her so but the justice of the peace who tried her 
                for trying to get out of a house of ill fame. My God, what senselessness 
                there is in this world!' he cried suddenly. `These new institutions, 
                these justices of the peace, these Zemstvo - what hideousness 
                it all is!' </p>
              <p> And he began to enlarge on his encounters with the new institutions. 
              </p>
              <p> Konstantin Levin listened to him, and that disbelief in the 
                sense of all public institutions, which he shared with him, and 
                often expressed, was now distasteful to him, coming from his brother's 
                lips. </p>
              <p> `In the other world we shall understand it all,' he said lightly. 
              </p>
              <p> `In the other world? Ah, I don't like that other world! I don't 
                like it,' he said, letting his scared wild eyes rest on his brother's 
                face. `Here one would think that to get out of all the baseness 
                and the mess, one's own and other people's, would be a good thing, 
                and yet I'm afraid of death, awfully afraid of death.' He shuddered. 
                `But do drink something. Would you like some champagne? Or shall 
                we go somewhere? Let's go to the gypsies! Do you know, I've gotten 
                very fond of the gypsies, and of Russian songs.' </p>
              <p> His speech had begun to falter, and he skipped at random from 
                one subject to another. Konstantin, with the help of Masha, persuaded 
                him not to go out anywhere, and got him to bed hopelessly drunk. 
              </p>
              <p> Masha promised to write to Konstantin in case of need, and to 
                persuade Nikolai to go and stay with his brother. </p>

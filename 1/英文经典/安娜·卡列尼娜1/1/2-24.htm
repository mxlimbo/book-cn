              <p><br>
                When Vronsky had looked at his watch on the Karenins' balcony, 
                he had been so greatly agitated and lost in his thoughts that, 
                although he saw the hands on the face of his watch, he could not 
                take in what time it was. He came out onto the highroad and walked, 
                picking his way carefully through the mud, to his carriage. He 
                was so completely absorbed in his feeling for Anna, that he did 
                not even think what o'clock it was, and whether he had time to 
                go to Briansky's. He preserved, as often happens, only the external 
                faculty of memory, that points out each step one has to take, 
                one after the other. He went up to his coachman, who was dozing 
                on the box in the shadow, already lengthening, of a thick lime 
                tree; he admired the shifting clouds of midges circling over the 
                hot horses, and, waking the coachman, he jumped into the carriage, 
                and told him to drive to Briansky's. It was only after driving 
                nearly seven verstas that he had sufficiently recovered himself 
                to look at his watch, and realize that it was half past five, 
                and that he was late. </p>
              <p>There were several races set for that day: the Body Guards' race, 
                then the officers' two-versta race, then the four-versta race, 
                and then the race for which he was entered. He could still be 
                in right time for his race, but if he went to Briansky's he could 
                be only in full time, and he would arrive when the whole Court 
                would be in their places. That would be a pity. But he had promised 
                Briansky to come, and so he decided to drive on, telling the coachman 
                not to spare the horses. </p>
              <p> He reached Briansky's, spent five minutes there, and galloped 
                back. This rapid drive calmed him. All that was painful in his 
                relations with Anna, all the feeling of indefiniteness left by 
                their conversation, had slipped out of his mind. He was thinking 
                now with pleasure and excitement of the race, of his being in 
                time after all, and now and then the thought of the happiness 
                of this night's assignation flashed across his imagination like 
                a dazzling light. </p>
              <p> The excitement of the approaching race gained upon him more 
                and more as he drove farther and farther into the atmosphere of 
                the races, overtaking carriages driving up from the summer villas 
                or out of Peterburg. </p>
              <p> There was no longer anyone at home at his quarters; all were 
                at the races, and his valet was looking out for him at the gate. 
                While he was changing his clothes, his valet told him that the 
                second race had begun already, that a lot of gentlemen had been 
                to ask for him, and a boy had twice run up from the stables. </p>
              <p> Dressing without hurry (he never hurried himself, and never 
                lost his self-possession), Vronsky drove to the sheds. From the 
                sheds he could see a perfect sea of carriages, and people on foot, 
                soldiers surrounding the racecourse, and pavilions swarming with 
                people. The second race was apparently going on, for just as he 
                went into the sheds he heard a bell ringing. Going toward the 
                stable, he met the white-legged chestnut, Makhotin's Gladiator, 
                being led to the racecourse in a blue and orange horsecloth, with 
                what looked like huge ears edged with blue. </p>
              <p> `Where's Cord?' he asked the stableboy. </p>
              <p> `In the stable, putting on the saddle.' </p>
              <p> In the open horse box stood Frou-Frou, saddled ready. They were 
                just going to lead her out. </p>
              <p> `I'm not too late?' </p>
              <p> `All right! All right!' said the Englishman; `don't upset yourself!' 
              </p>
              <p> Vronsky once more took in at one glance the beautiful lines 
                of his favorite mare, who was quivering all over, and with an 
                effort he tore himself from the sight of her, and went out of 
                the stable. He went toward the pavilions at the most favorable 
                moment for escaping attention. The two-versta race was just finishing, 
                and all eyes were fixed on the cavalry guard in front and the 
                light hussar behind, urging their horses on with a last effort 
                close to the winning post. From the center and outside of the 
                ring all were crowding to the winning post, and a group of soldiers 
                and officers of the cavalry guards were shouting loudly their 
                delight at the expected triumph of their officer and comrade. 
                Vronsky moved into the middle of the crowd unnoticed, almost at 
                the very moment when the bell rang at the finish of the race, 
                and the tall, mud-spattered cavalry guard who came in first, leaning 
                over the saddle, let go the reins of his panting gray stallion 
                that looked dark with sweat. </p>
              <p> The stallion, stiffening out his legs, with an effort stopped 
                his rapid course, and the officer of the cavalry guards looked 
                round him like a man waking up from a heavy sleep, and just managed 
                to smile. A crowd of friends and outsiders pressed round him. 
              </p>
              <p> Vronsky intentionally avoided that select crowd of upper world, 
                which was moving and talking with discreet freedom before the 
                pavilions. He knew that Madame Karenina was there, and Betsy, 
                and his brother's wife, and he purposely did not go near them 
                for fear of something distracting his attention. But he was continually 
                met and stopped by acquaintances, who told him about the previous 
                races, and kept asking him why he was so late. </p>
              <p> At the time when the racers had to go to the pavilion to receive 
                the prizes, and all attention was directed to that point, Vronsky's 
                elder brother, Alexandre, a colonel with the shoulder knot, came 
                up to him. He was not tall, though as broadly built as Alexei, 
                and handsomer and rosier than he; he had a red nose, and an open, 
                tipsy face. </p>
              <p> `Did you get my note?' he said. `There's never any finding you.' 
              </p>
              <p> Alexandre Vronsky, in spite of his dissolute life, and particularly 
                his drunken habits, for which he was notorious, was quite one 
                of the Court circle. </p>
              <p> Now, as he talked to his brother of a matter bound to be exceedingly 
                disagreeable to him, knowing that the eyes of many people might 
                be fixed upon him, he kept a smiling countenance, as though he 
                were jesting with his brother about something of little moment. 
              </p>
              <p> `I got it, and I really can't make out what you are worrying 
                yourself about,' said Alexei. </p>
              <p> `I'm worrying myself because the remark has just been made to 
                me that you weren't here, and that you were seen in Peterhof on 
                Monday.' </p>
              <p> `There are matters which only concern those directly interested 
                in them, and the matter you are so worried about is of that nature...' 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, but if so, one does not belong in the service, one does 
                not...' </p>
              <p> `I beg you not to meddle, and that is all.' </p>
              <p> Alexei Vronsky's frowning face turned pale, and his prominent 
                lower jaw quivered, which happened rarely with him. Being a man 
                of very warm heart, he was seldom angry; but when he was angry, 
                and when his chin quivered, then, as Alexandre Vronsky knew, he 
                was dangerous. Alexandre Vronsky smiled gaily. </p>
              <p> `I only wanted to give you mother's letter. Answer it and don't 
                worry about anything just before the race. Bonne chance,' he added, 
                smiling, and he moved away from him. But after him another friendly 
                greeting brought Vronsky to a standstill. </p>
              <p> `So you won't recognize your friends! How are you, mon cher?' 
                said Stepan Arkadyevich, as conspicuously brilliant in the midst 
                of all the Peterburg brilliance as he was in Moscow, his face 
                rosy, and his whiskers sleek and glossy. `I came up yesterday, 
                and I'm delighted because I shall see your triumph. When shall 
                we meet?' </p>
              <p> `Come tomorrow to the messroom,' said Vronsky, and squeezing 
                him by the sleeve of his greatcoat, with apologies, he moved away 
                to the center of the racecourse, where the horses were being led 
                for the great steeplechase. </p>
              <p> The horses who had run in the last race were being led home, 
                steaming and exhausted, by the stableboys, and one after another 
                the fresh horses for the coming race made their appearance, for 
                the most part English racers, wearing horsecloths and looking 
                with their drawn-up bellies like strange, huge birds. On the right 
                Frou-Frou was led in, lean and beautiful, lifting up her elastic, 
                rather long pasterns, as though moved by springs. Not far from 
                her they were taking the caparison off the lop-cared Gladiator. 
                The strong, exquisite, perfectly correct lines of the stallion, 
                with his superb hindquarters and excessively short pasterns almost 
                over his hoofs, attracted Vronsky's attention in spite of himself. 
                He would have gone up to his mare, but he was again detained by 
                an acquaintance. </p>
              <p> `Oh, there's Karenin!' said the acquaintance with whom he was 
                chatting. `He's looking for his wife, and she's in the middle 
                of the pavilion. Didn't you see her?' </p>
              <p> `No, I didn't,' answered Vronsky, and without even glancing 
                round toward the pavilion where his friend was pointing out Madame 
                Karenina, he went up to his mare. </p>
              <p> Vronsky had not had time to look at the saddle, about which 
                he had to give some direction, when the entrants were summoned 
                to the pavilion to receive their numbers and places in the row 
                at starting. Seventeen officers, looking serious and severe, many 
                with pale faces, met together in the pavilion and drew the numbers. 
                Vronsky drew number 7. The cry was heard: `Mount!' </p>
              <p> Feeling that, with the others riding in the race, he was the 
                center upon which all eyes were fastened, Vronsky walked up to 
                his mare in that state of nervous tension in which he usually 
                became dilatory and calm in his movements. Cord, in honor of the 
                races, had put on his best clothes, a black coat buttoned up, 
                a stiffly starched collar, which propped up his cheeks, a black 
                bowler and Hessian boots. He was calm and dignified as ever, and 
                was with his own hands holding Frou-Frou by both reins, standing 
                straight in front of her. Frou-Frou was still trembling as though 
                in a fever. Her eye, full of fire, glanced sideways at Vronsky. 
                Vronsky slipped his finger under the saddle girth. The mare glanced 
                aslant at him, drew up her lip, and twitched her ear. The Englishman 
                puckered up his lips, intending to indicate a smile that anyone 
                should verify his saddling. </p>
              <p> `Get up; you won't feel so excited.' </p>
              <p> Vronsky looked round for the last time at his rivals. He knew 
                that he would not see them during the race. Two were already riding 
                forward to the point from which they were to start. Galtsin, a 
                friend of Vronsky's and one of his more formidable rivals, was 
                moving round a bay horse that would not let him mount. A little 
                hussar of the life guards in tight riding breeches rode off at 
                a gallop, crouched up like a cat over the porridge, in imitation 
                of English jockeys. Prince Kuzovlev sat with a white face on his 
                thoroughbred mare from the Grabovsky stud, while an English groom 
                led her by the bridle. Vronsky and all his comrades knew Kuzovlev 
                and his peculiarity of `weak nerves' and terrible vanity. They 
                knew that he was afraid of everything - afraid of riding a line 
                horse. But now, just because it was terrible, because people broke 
                their necks, and there was a doctor standing at each obstacle, 
                and an ambulance with a cross on it, and a sister of mercy, he 
                had made up his mind to take part in the race. Their eyes met, 
                and Vronsky gave him a friendly and encouraging nod. Only one 
                he did not see, his chief rival, Makhotin on Gladiator. </p>
              <p> `Don't be in a hurry,' said Cord to Vronsky, `and remember one 
                thing: don't hold her in at the fences, and don't urge her on; 
                let her go as she likes.' </p>
              <p> `All right, all right,' said Vronsky, taking the reins. </p>
              <p> `If you can, lead the race; but don't lose heart till the last 
                minute, even if you're behind.' </p>
              <p> Before the mare had time to move, Vronsky stepped with an agile, 
                vigorous movement into the steel-toothed stirrup, and lightly 
                and firmly placed his compacted body on the creaking leather of 
                the saddle. Getting his right foot in the stirrup, he with habitual 
                moving smoothed the double reins between his fingers, and Cord 
                let go. As though she did not know which foot to put first, Frou-Frou 
                started, dragging at the reins with her long neck, and as though 
                she were on springs, shaking her rider from side to side. Cord 
                quickened his step, following him. The excited mare, trying to 
                deceive her rider, pulled at the reins, first on one side and 
                then the other, and Vronsky tried in vain with voice and hand 
                to soothe her. </p>
              <p> They were just reaching the dammed-up stream on their way to 
                the starting point. Several of the riders were in front and several 
                behind, when suddenly Vronsky heard the sound of a horse galloping 
                in the behind him, and he was overtaken by Makhotin on his white-legged, 
                lop-eared Gladiator. Makhotin smiled, showing his long teeth, 
                but Vronsky looked at him angrily. He did not like him, and regarded 
                him now as his most formidable rival. He was angry with him for 
                galloping past and exciting his mare. Frou-Frou started into a 
                gallop, her left foot forward, made two bounds, and fretting at 
                the tightened reins, passed into a jolting trot, bumping her rider 
                up and down. Cord, too, scowled, and followed Vronsky almost ambling. 
              </p>

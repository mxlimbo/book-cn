              <p><br>
                Kitty made the acquaintance of Madame Stahl too, and this acquaintance, 
                together with her friendship with Varenka, did not merely exercise 
                a great influence on her - it also comforted her in her mental 
                distress. She found this comfort through a completely new world 
                being opened to her by means of this acquaintance, a world having 
                nothing in common with her past; an exalted, noble world, from 
                the height of which she could contemplate her past calmly. It 
                was revealed to her that besides the instinctive life to which 
                Kitty had given herself up hitherto there was a spiritual life. 
                This life was disclosed in religion, but a religion having nothing 
                in common with that one which Kitty had known from childhood, 
                and which found expression in masses and evening services at the 
                Widow's Home, where one might meet one's friends; and in learning 
                by heart Slavonic texts with the priest. This was a lofty, mysterious 
                religion connected with a whole series of noble thoughts and feelings, 
                which one could not merely believe because one was told to believe, 
                but which one could love. </p>
              <p>Kitty found all this out not from words. Madame Stahl talked 
                to Kitty as to a charming child that one regards with pleasure, 
                as one regards the memory of one's youth, and only once she said 
                in passing that in all human sorrows nothing gives comfort but 
                love and faith, and that in the sight of Christ's compassion for 
                us no sorrow is trifling - and immediately talked of other things. 
                But in every gesture of Madame Stahl, in every word, in every 
                heavenly - as Kitty called it - look; and, above all, in the whole 
                story of her life, which she heard from Varenka, Kitty recognized 
                that something `that was important,' of which, till then, she 
                had known nothing. </p>
              <p> Yet, elevated as Madame Stahl's character was, touching as was 
                her story, and exalted and moving as was her speech, Kitty could 
                not help detecting in her some traits which perplexed her. She 
                noticed that, when questioning her about her family, Madame Stahl 
                had smiled contemptuously, which was not in accord with Christian 
                meekness. Kitty noticed, too, that when she had found a Catholic 
                priest with her, Madame Stahl had studiously kept her face in 
                the shadow of the lamp shade and had smiled in a peculiar way. 
                Trivial as these two observations were, they perplexed her, and 
                she had her doubts as to Madame Stahl. But on the other hand Varenka, 
                alone in the world, without friends or relations, with a melancholy 
                disappointment in the past, desiring nothing, regretting nothing, 
                was just that perfection of which Kitty dared hardly dream. In 
                Varenka she realized that one has but to forget oneself and love 
                others, and one will be calm, happy and good. And that was what 
                Kitty longed to be. Seeing now clearly what was most important, 
                Kitty was not satisfied with being enthusiastic over it; she at 
                once gave herself up with her whole soul to the new life that 
                was opening to her. From Varenka's accounts of the doings of Madame 
                Stahl and other people whom she mentioned, Kitty had already constructed 
                the plan of her own future life. She would, like Madame Stahl's 
                niece, Aline, of whom Varenka had talked to her a great deal, 
                seek out those who were in trouble, wherever she might be living, 
                help them as far as she could, giving them the Gospel; she would 
                read the Gospel to the sick, to the criminals, to the dying. The 
                idea of reading the Gospel to criminals, as Aline did, particularly 
                fascinated Kitty. But all these were secret dreams, of which Kitty 
                did not talk either to her mother or to Varenka. </p>
              <p> While awaiting the time for carrying out her plans on a large 
                scale, however, Kitty, even then at the springs, where there were 
                so many people ill and unhappy, readily found a chance for practicing 
                her new principles in imitation of Varenka. </p>
              <p> At first the Princess noticed nothing but that Kitty was much 
                under the influence of her engouement, as she called it, for Madame 
                Stahl, and still more for Varenka. She saw that Kitty did not 
                merely imitate Varenka in her conduct, but unconsciously imitated 
                her in her manner of walking, of talking, of blinking her eyes. 
                But later on the Princess noticed that, apart from this adoration, 
                some kind of serious spiritual change was taking place in her 
                daughter. </p>
              <p> The Princess saw that in the evenings Kitty read a French Testament 
                that Madame Stahl had given her - a thing she had never done before; 
                that she avoided society acquaintances and associated with the 
                sick people who were under Varenka's protection, and especially 
                one poor family, that of a sick painter, Petrov. Kitty was unmistakably 
                proud of playing the part of a sister of mercy in that family. 
                All this was well enough, and the Princess had nothing to say 
                against it, especially as Petrov's wife was a perfectly respectable 
                woman, and that the German Princess, noticing Kitty's devotion, 
                praised her, calling her an angel of consolation. All this would 
                have been very well, if there had been no exaggeration. But the 
                Princess saw that her daughter was rushing into extremes, and 
                so indeed she told her. </p>
              <p> `Il ne faut jamais rien outrer,' she said to her. </p>
              <p> Her daughter made her no reply, but in her heart she thought 
                that one could not talk about exaggeration where Christianity 
                was concerned. What exaggeration could there be in the practice 
                of a doctrine wherein one was bidden to turn the other cheek when 
                one was smitten, and give one's shirt if one's coat were taken? 
                But the Princess disliked this exaggeration, and disliked even 
                more the fact that she felt her daughter did not care to show 
                her all her heart. Kitty did in fact conceal her new views and 
                feelings from her mother. She concealed them not because she did 
                not respect or did not love her mother, but simply because she 
                was her mother. She would have revealed them to anyone sooner 
                than to her mother. </p>
              <p> `How is it Anna Pavlovna's not been to see us for so long?' 
                the Princess said one day, referring to Madame Petrov. `I've asked 
                her, but she seems put out about something.' </p>
              <p> `No, I've not noticed it, maman,' said Kitty, flushing hotly. 
              </p>
              <p> `Is it long since you've been to see them?' </p>
              <p> `We intend making an excursion to the mountains tomorrow,' answered 
                Kitty. </p>
              <p> `Well, you may go,' answered the Princess, gazing at her daughter's 
                embarrassed face and trying to guess the cause of her embarrassment. 
              </p>
              <p> That day Varenka came to dinner and told them that Anna Pavlovna 
                had changed her mind and given up the excursion for the morrow. 
                And the Princess noticed again that Kitty reddened. </p>
              <p> `Kitty, haven't you had some misunderstanding with the Petrovs?' 
                said the Princess, when they were left alone. `Why has she given 
                up sending the children and coming to see us?' </p>
              <p> Kitty answered that nothing had happened between them, and that 
                she could not tell why Anna Pavlovna seemed displeased with her. 
                Kitty answered perfectly truthfully. She did not know the reason 
                Anna Pavlovna had changed toward her, but she guessed it. She 
                guessed at something which she could not tell her mother, which 
                she did not put into words to herself It was one of those things 
                which one knows but which one can never speak of even to oneself, 
                so terrible and shameful would it be to be mistaken. </p>
              <p> Again and again she went over in her memory all her relations 
                with the family. She remembered the simple delight expressed on 
                the round, good-natured face of Anna Pavlovna at their meetings; 
                she remembered their secret confabulations about the invalid, 
                their plots to draw him away from the work which was forbidden 
                him, and to get him out of doors; the devotion of the youngest 
                boy, who used to call her `my Kitty,' and would not go to bed 
                without her. How lovely it all was! `Then she recalled the thin, 
                terribly thin figure of Petrov, with his long neck, in his brown 
                coat, his scant, curly hair, his questioning blue eyes that were 
                so terrible to Kitty at first, and his painful attempts to seem 
                hearty and lively in her presence. She recalled the efforts she 
                had made at first to overcome the repugnance she felt for him, 
                as for all consumptive people, and the pains it had cost her to 
                think of things to say to him. She recalled the timid, softened 
                look with which he gazed at her, and the strange feeling of compassion 
                and awkwardness, and later of a sense of her own goodness, which 
                she had felt at it. How lovely it all was! But all that was at 
                first. Now, a few days ago, everything was suddenly spoiled. Anna 
                Pavlovna had met Kitty with affected cordiality, and had kept 
                continual watch on her and on her husband. </p>
              <p> Could that touching pleasure he showed when she came near be 
                the cause of Anna Pavlovna's coolness? </p>
              <p> `Yes,' she mused, `there was something unnatural about Anna 
                Pavlovna, and utterly unlike her good nature, when she said angrily 
                the day before yesterday: ``There, he will keep waiting for you; 
                he wouldn't drink his coffee without you, though he's grown so 
                dreadfully weak.'' </p>
              <p> `Yes, perhaps, too, she didn't like it when I gave him the rug. 
                It was all so simple, but he took it so awkwardly, and was so 
                long thanking me, that I felt awkward too. And then that portrait 
                of me he did so well. And most of all that look of confusion and 
                tenderness! Yes, yes, that's it!' Kitty repeated to herself with 
                horror. `No, it can't be, it oughtn't to be! He's so much to be 
                pitied!' she said to herself directly after. </p>
              <p> This doubt poisoned the charm of her new life. </p>

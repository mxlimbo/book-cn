              <p><br>
                Unconsciously going over in his memory the conversations that 
                had taken place during and after dinner, Alexei Alexandrovich 
                returned to his solitary room. Darya Alexandrovna's words about 
                forgiveness had aroused in him nothing but annoyance. The applicability 
                or nonapplicability of the Christian precept to his own case was 
                too difficult a question to be discussed lightly, and this question 
                had long ago been answered by Alexei Alexandrovich in the negative. 
                Of all that had been said, what stuck most in his memory was the 
                phrase of stupid, good-natured Turovtsin: `Acted like a man, he 
                did! Called him out and shot him!' Everyone had apparently shared 
                this feeling, though from politeness they had not expressed it. 
              </p>
              <p>`But the matter is settled; it's useless thinking about it,' 
                Alexei Alexandrovich told himself. And thinking of nothing but 
                the journey before him, and the revision work he had to do, he 
                went into his room and asked the porter who escorted him where 
                his man was; the porter said that the man had just gone out. Alexei 
                Alexandrovich ordered tea to be sent him, sat down to the table, 
                and, taking the schedule, began considering the route of his journey. 
              </p>
              <p> `Two telegrams,' said his valet, coming into the room. `I beg 
                your pardon, Your Excellency; I'd just stepped out this very minute.' 
              </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich took the telegrams and opened them. The 
                first telegram was the announcement of Stremov's appointment to 
                the very post Karenin had coveted. Alexei Alexandrovich flung 
                the telegram down, and, flushing, got up and began to pace up 
                and down the room. `Quos vult perdere dementat,' he said, meaning 
                by quos the persons responsible for this appointment. He was not 
                so much annoyed at not receiving the post, as at having been so 
                conspicuously passed over; but it was incomprehensible, amazing 
                to him that they did not see that the wordy phrasemonger Stremov 
                was the last man fit for it. How could they fail to see they were 
                ruining themselves, lowering their prestige by this appointment? 
              </p>
              <p> `Something else in the same line,' he said to himself bitterly, 
                opening the second telegram. The telegram was from his wife. Her 
                name, written in blue pencil, `Anna,' was the first thing that 
                caught his eye. `I am dying; I beg, I implore you to come. I shall 
                die easier with your forgiveness,' he read. He smiled contemptuously, 
                and flung down the telegram. That this was a trick and a fraud, 
                of that - he thought for the first minute - there could be no 
                doubt. </p>
              <p> `There is no deceit she would stick at. She was near her confinement. 
                Perhaps it is the confinement. But what can be their aim? To legitimize 
                the child, to compromise me, and prevent a divorce,' he thought. 
                `But something was said in it: I am dying...' He read the telegram 
                again, and suddenly the plain meaning of what was said in it struck 
                him. `And if it is true?' he said to himself. `If it is true that 
                in the moment of agony and nearness to death she is genuinely 
                penitent, and I, taking it for a trick, refuse to go? That would 
                not only be cruel, and everyone would blame me, but it would be 
                stupid on my part.' </p>
              <p> `Piotr, call a coach; I am going to Peterburg,' he said to his 
                servant. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich decided that he would go to Peterburg and 
                see his wife. If her illness was a trick, he would say nothing 
                and go away again. If she were really in danger, and wished to 
                see him before her death, he would forgive her if he found her 
                alive, and pay her the last duties if he came too late. </p>
              <p> All the way he thought no more of what he ought to do. </p>
              <p> With a sense of weariness and uncleanness from the night spent 
                in the train, in the early fog of Peterburg, Alexei Alexandrovich 
                drove through the deserted Nevsky Prospect, and stared straight 
                before him, without thinking of what was awaiting him. He could 
                not think about it, because in picturing what would happen, he 
                could not drive away the reflection that her death would at once 
                remove all the difficulty of his position. Bakers, closed shops, 
                night cabmen, street sweepers sweeping the pavements flashed past 
                his eyes, and he watched it all, trying to smother the thought 
                of what was awaiting him, and what he dared not hope for, and 
                yet was hoping for. He drove up to the steps. A hackney sleigh, 
                and a coach with its coachman asleep, stood at the entrance. As 
                he went into the entry, Alexei Alexandrovich seemed to get out 
                his resolution from the remotest corner of his brain, and mastered 
                it thoroughly. Its meaning ran: `If it's a trick, then calm contempt 
                and departure. If truth, do what is seemly.' </p>
              <p> The porter opened the door before Alexei Alexandrovich rang. 
                The porter, Kapitonich, looked queer in an old coat, without a 
                tie, and in slippers. </p>
              <p> `How is your mistress?' </p>
              <p> `She was confined yesterday, successfully.' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich stopped short and turned white. He felt 
                distinctly now how intensely he had longed for her death. </p>
              <p> `And how is she?' </p>
              <p> Kornei in his morning apron ran downstairs. </p>
              <p> `Very ill,' he answered. `There was a consultation yesterday, 
                and the doctor's here now.' </p>
              <p> `Take my things,' said Alexei Alexandrovich, and, feeling some 
                relief at the news that there was still hope of her death, he 
                went into the hall. </p>
              <p> On the hatstand there was a military overcoat. Alexei Alexandrovich 
                noticed it and asked: </p>
              <p> `Who is here?' </p>
              <p> `The doctor, the midwife, and Count Vronsky.' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich went into the inner rooms. </p>
              <p> In the drawing room there was no one; at the sound of his steps 
                the midwife came out of Anna's boudoir, in a cap with lilac ribbons. 
              </p>
              <p> She went up to Alexei Alexandrovich, and with the familiarity 
                given by the approach of death took him by the arm and drew him 
                toward the bedroom. </p>
              <p> `Thank God you've come! She keeps on talking about you, and 
                nothing but you,' she said. </p>
              <p> `Make haste with the ice!' the doctor's peremptory voice came 
                from the bedroom. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich went into the boudoir. At her table, sitting 
                sideways in a low chair, was Vronsky, his face hidden in his hands, 
                weeping. He jumped up at the doctor's voice, took his hands from 
                his face, and saw Alexei Alexandrovich. Seeing the husband, he 
                was so overwhelmed that he sat down again, drawing his head into 
                his shoulders, as if he wanted to disappear; but he made an effort 
                over himself, got up and said: </p>
              <p> `She is dying. The doctors say there is no hope. I am entirely 
                in your power, only let me be here... though I am at your disposal. 
                I...' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich, seeing Vronsky's tears, felt a rush of 
                that nervous emotion always produced in him by the sight of other 
                people's sufferings, and, turning away his face, he moved hurriedly 
                to the door, without hearing the rest of the words. From the bedroom 
                came the sound of Anna's voice saying something. Her voice was 
                lively, animated, with exceedingly distinct intonations. Alexei 
                Alexandrovich went into the bedroom, and walked up to the bed. 
                She was lying with her face turned toward him. Her cheeks were 
                flushed crimson, her eyes glittered, her little white hands thrust 
                out from the cuffs of her dressing gown were playing with the 
                quilt, twisting it about. It seemed as though she were not only 
                well and blooming, but in the happiest frame of mind. She was 
                talking rapidly, musically, and with exceptionally correct articulation 
                and expressive intonation. </p>
              <p> `Because Alexei - I am speaking of Alexei Alexandrovich (what 
                a strange and awful thing that both are Alexeis, isn't it?) - 
                Alexei would not refuse me. I should forget, he would forgive... 
                But why doesn't he come? He's so good, he doesn't know himself 
                how good he is. Ah, my God, what pangs! Give me some water, quick! 
                Oh, that will be bad for her - my little girl! Oh, very well then, 
                give her to a nurse. Yes, I agree, it's better in fact. He'll 
                be coming; it will hurt him to see her. Give her to the nurse.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Anna Arkadyevna, he has come. Here he is!' said the midwife, 
                trying to attract her attention to Alexei Alexandrovich. </p>
              <p> `Oh, what nonsense!' Anna went on, not seeing her husband. `No, 
                give her to me; give me my little one! He has not come yet. You 
                say he won't forgive me, because you don't know him. No one knows 
                him. I'm the only one, and it was hard for me even. I ought to 
                know his eyes - Seriozha has just such eyes - and I can't bear 
                to see them because of it. Has Seriozha had his dinner? I know 
                everyone will forget to do it. He would not forget. Seriozha must 
                be moved into the corner room, and Mariette must be asked to sleep 
                with him.' </p>
              <p> All of a sudden she shrank back, and was silent; and in terror, 
                as though expecting a blow, as though to defend herself, she raised 
                her hands to her face. She had seen her husband. </p>
              <p> `No, no!' she began. `I am not afraid of him; I am afraid of 
                death. Alexei, come here. I am in a hurry, because I've no time, 
                I haven't long left to live; the fever will begin directly and 
                I shall understand nothing more. Now I understand, I understand 
                it all - I see it all!' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich's wrinkled face wore an expression of suffering; 
                he took her by the hand and tried to say something, but he could 
                not utter it; his lower lip quivered, but he still went on struggling 
                with his emotion, and only now and then glanced at her. And each 
                time he glanced at her, he saw her eyes gazing at him with such 
                passionate and exultant tenderness as he had never yet seen in 
                them. </p>
              <p> `Wait a minute, you don't know... Stay a little, stay!...' She 
                stopped, as though collecting her ideas. `Yes,' she began, `yes, 
                yes, yes! This is what I wanted to say. Don't be surprised at 
                me. I'm still the same... But there is another woman in me - I'm 
                afraid of her: she loved that man, and I tried to hate you, and 
                could not forget about her that used to be. That woman isn't myself. 
                Now I'm my real self. I'm dying now, I know I shall die - ask 
                him. Even now I feel - see here, the weights on my feet, on my 
                hands, on my fingers. My fingers - see how huge they are! But 
                this will soon be all over... Only one thing I want: forgive me, 
                forgive me quite. I'm terrible, but my nurse would tell me - the 
                holy martyr - what was her name? She was worse. And I'll go to 
                Rome; there's a wilderness, and there I shall be no trouble to 
                anyone, only I'll take Seriozha and the little one.... No, you 
                can't forgive me! I know, it can't be forgiven! No, no, go away, 
                you're too good!' She held his hand in one burning hand, while 
                she pushed him away with the other. </p>
              <p> The nervous agitation of Alexei Alexandrovich kept increasing, 
                and had by now reached such a point that he ceased to struggle 
                with it. He suddenly felt that what he had regarded as nervous 
                agitation was on the contrary a blissful spiritual condition that 
                gave him all at once a new happiness he had never known. He did 
                not think that the Christian law, which he had been all his life 
                trying to follow, enjoined on him to forgive and love his enemies; 
                but a joyous feeling of love and forgiveness for his enemies filled 
                his heart. He knelt down, and laying his head in the curve of 
                her arm, which burned him as with fire through the sleeve, he 
                sobbed like a little child. She put her arm around his head, which 
                was beginning to grow bald, moved toward him, and with defiant 
                pride lifted up her eyes. </p>
              <p> `That is he. I knew him! Now, good-by, everyone, good-by!... 
                They've come again; why don't they go away?... Oh, take these 
                fur coats off me!' </p>
              <p> The doctor unloosed her hands, carefully laying her on the pillow, 
                and covered her up to the shoulders. She lay back submissively, 
                and looked before her with beaming eyes. </p>
              <p> `Remember one thing, that I needed nothing but forgiveness, 
                and I want nothing more.... Why doesn't he come?' she said, turning 
                to the door, toward Vronsky. `Do come, do come! Give him your 
                hand.' </p>
              <p> Vronsky came to the side of the bed, and seeing Anna, again 
                hid his face in his hands. </p>
              <p> `Uncover your face - look at him! He's a saint,' she said. `Oh! 
                uncover your face, do uncover it!' she said angrily. `Alexei Alexandrovich, 
                do uncover his face! I want to see him.' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich took Vronsky's hands and drew them away 
                from his face, which was awful with the expression of agony and 
                shame upon it. </p>
              <p> `Give him your hand. Forgive him.' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich gave him his hand, not attempting to restrain 
                the tears that streamed from his eyes. </p>
              <p> `Thank God, thank God!' she said, `now everything is ready. 
                Only to stretch my legs a little. There, that's capital. How badly 
                these flowers are done - not a bit like a violet,' she said, pointing 
                to the hangings. `My God, my God! when will it end? Give me some 
                morphine. Doctor, give me some morphine! Oh, my God, my God!' 
              </p>
              <p> And she tossed about on the bed. </p>
              <p> The doctors said that it was puerperal fever, and that ninety-nine 
                chances in a hundred it would end in death. The whole day long 
                there was fever, delirium, and unconsciousness. At midnight the 
                patient lay without consciousness, and almost without pulse. </p>
              <p> The end was expected every minute. </p>
              <p> Vronsky had gone home, but in the morning he came to inquire, 
                and Alexei Alexandrovich, meeting him in the hall, said: `Better 
                stay, she might ask for you,' and himself led him to his wife's 
                boudoir. Toward morning there was a return again of excitement, 
                rapid thought and talk, and again it ended in unconsciousness. 
                On the third day it was the same thing, and the doctors said there 
                was hope. That day Alexei Alexandrovich went into the boudoir 
                where Vronsky was sitting, and, closing the door, sat down opposite 
                him. </p>
              <p> `Alexei Alexandrovich,' said Vronsky, feeling that a statement 
                of the situation was coming, `I can't speak, I can't understand. 
                Spare me! However hard it is for you, believe me, it is more terrible 
                for me.' </p>
              <p> He would have risen; but Alexei Alexandrovich took him by the 
                hand and said: </p>
              <p> `I beg you to hear me out; it is necessary. I must explain my 
                feelings, the feelings that have guided me, and will guide me, 
                so that you may not be in error regarding me. You know I had resolved 
                on a divorce, and had even begun to take proceedings. I won't 
                conceal from you that in beginning this I was in uncertainty, 
                I was in misery; I will confess that I was pursued by a desire 
                to revenge myself on you and on her. When I got the telegram, 
                I came here with the same feelings; I will say more - I longed 
                for her death. But...' He paused, pondering whether to disclose 
                or not to disclose his feelings. `But I saw her and forgave her. 
                And the happiness of forgiveness has revealed to me my duty. I 
                forgive completely. I would offer the other cheek, I would give 
                my cloak if my coat be taken. I pray to God only not to take from 
                me the bliss of forgiveness!' </p>
              <p> Tears stood in his eyes, and the luminous, serene look in them 
                impressed Vronsky. </p>
              <p> `This is my position: you can trample me in the mud, make me 
                the laughingstock of the world - I will not abandon her, and I 
                will never utter a word of reproach to you,' Alexei Alexandrovich 
                went on. `My duty is clearly marked for me; I ought to be with 
                her, and I will be. If she wishes to see you, I will let you know, 
                but now I suppose it would be better for you to go away.' </p>
              <p> He got up, and sobs cut short his words. Vronsky too was getting 
                up, and in a stooping, not yet erect posture, looked up at him 
                from under his brows. He did not understand Alexei Alexandrovich's 
                feeling, but he felt that it was something higher, and even unattainable 
                for him with his view of life. </p>

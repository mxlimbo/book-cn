              <p> <br>
                Although all Vronsky's inner life was absorbed in his passion, 
                his external life unalterably and inevitably followed along the 
                old accustomed lines of his social and regimental ties and interests. 
                The interests of his regiment took an important place in Vronsky's 
                life, both because he was fond of the regiment, and still more 
                because the regiment was fond of him. They were not only fond 
                of Vronsky in his regiment, they respected him too, and were proud 
                of him; proud that this man, with his immense wealth, his brilliant 
                education and abilities, and the path open before him to every 
                kind of success, distinction and ambition, had disregarded all 
                that, and of all the interests of life had the interests of his 
                regiment and his comrades nearest to his heart. Vronsky was aware 
                of his comrades' view of him, and in addition to his liking for 
                that sort of life, he felt bound to keep up that reputation. </p>
              <p>It need not be said that he did not speak of his love to any 
                of his comrades, nor did he betray his secret even in the wildest 
                drinking bouts (though indeed he was never so drunk as to lose 
                all control of himself). And he closed the mouths of any of his 
                thoughtless comrades who attempted to allude to his liaison. But, 
                in spite of that, his love was known to all the town; everyone 
                guessed with more or less certainty at his relations with Madame 
                Karenina. The majority of the younger men envied him for just 
                what was the most irksome factor in his love - the exalted position 
                of Karenin, and the consequent transparency to society, of their 
                liaison. </p>
              <p> The greater number of the young women, who envied Anna and had 
                long been weary of having her called righteous, rejoiced at the 
                fulfillment of their predictions, and were only waiting for a 
                decisive turn in public opinion to fall upon her with all the 
                weight of their scorn. They were already making ready their handfuls 
                of mud to cast at her when the right moment arrived. The greater 
                number of the middle-aged people and certain great personages 
                were displeased at the prospect of the impending scandal in society. 
              </p>
              <p> Vronsky's mother, on hearing of his liaison, was at first pleased 
                by it, because nothing to her mind gave such a finishing touch 
                to a brilliant young man as a liaison in the highest society; 
                she was pleased, too, that Madame Karenina, who had so taken her 
                fancy, and had talked so much of her son, was, after all, just 
                like all the other pretty and decent women - according to the 
                Countess Vronskaia's ideas. But she had heard of late that her 
                son had refused a position offered him of great importance to 
                his career, simply in order to remain in the regiment, where could 
                be constantly seeing Madame Karenina; she heard that great personages 
                were displeased with him on this account, and she changed her 
                opinion. She was vexed, too, that from all she could learn of 
                this liaison it was not that brilliant, graceful, worldly liaison 
                which she would have welcomed, but a sort of Werther's desperate 
                passion, so she was told, which might well lead him into follies. 
                She had not seen him since his abrupt departure from Moscow, and 
                she sent her elder son to bid him to come to her. </p>
              <p> This elder brother, too, was displeased with his younger brother. 
                He did not distinguish what sort of love his might be, big or 
                little, passionate or passionless, pure or impure (he kept a ballet 
                girl himself, though he was the father of a family, so he was 
                rather indulgent), but he knew that this love displeased those 
                whom it was necessary to please, and therefore he did not approve 
                of his brother's conduct. </p>
              <p> Besides the service and society, Vronsky had another great interest 
                - horses; he was passionately fond of horses. </p>
              <p> That year races and a steeplechase had been arranged for the 
                officers. Vronsky had put his name down, bought a thoroughbred 
                English mare, and in spite of his love, he was looking forward 
                to the races with intense, though reserved, excitement.... </p>
              <p> These two passions did not interfere with one another. On the 
                contrary, he needed occupation and distraction quite apart from 
                his love, so as to recruit and rest himself from the violent emotions 
                that agitated him. </p>

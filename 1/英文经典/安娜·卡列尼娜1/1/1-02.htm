              <p><br>
                Stepan Arkadyevich was a truthful man in his relations with himself. 
                He was incapable of self-deception and of persuading himself that 
                he repented his conduct. He could not at this date repent the 
                fact that he, handsome, susceptible to love, a man of thirty-four, 
                was not in love with his wife, the mother of five living and two 
                dead children, and only a year younger than himself. All he repented 
                was that he had not succeeded better in hiding this from his wife. 
                But he felt all the difficulty of his position and was sorry for 
                his wife, his children, and himself. Possibly he might have managed 
                to conceal his sins better from his wife if he had anticipated 
                that the knowledge of them would have had such an effect upon 
                her. He had never clearly reflected on the subject, but he had 
                vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have suspected him 
                of being unfaithful to her, and had shut her eyes to the fact. 
                He had even supposed that she, a worn-out woman no longer young 
                or good-looking, and in no way remarkable or uncommon - merely 
                a good mother - ought from a sense of fairness to take an indulgent 
                view. It had turned out quite the other way. </p>
              <p>`Oh, it's awful! Oh dear, oh dear! Awful!' Stepan Arkadyevich 
                kept repeating to himself, and he could think of nothing to be 
                done. `And how well things were going up till now! How well we 
                got on! She was contented and happy in her children; I never interfered 
                with her in anything; I let her manage the children and the house 
                just as she liked. True, it's bad her having been a governess 
                in our house. That's bad! There's something common, vulgar, in 
                flirting with one's governess. But what a governess!' (He vividly 
                recalled the roguish black eyes of Mlle. Roland and her smile.) 
                `But after all, while she was in the house, I kept myself in hand. 
                And the worst of it all is that she's already... It seems as if 
                ill luck would have it so! Oh, oh! But what, what is to be done?' 
              </p>
              <p> There was no solution, save that universal solution which life 
                gives to all questions, even the most complex and insolvable: 
                One must live in the needs of the day - that is, forget oneself. 
                To forget himself in sleep was impossible now, at least till nighttime; 
                he could not go back now to the music sung by the decanter women; 
                so he must forget himself in the dream of daily life. </p>
              <p> `Then we shall see,' Stepan Arkadyevich said to himself, and 
                getting up he put on a gray dressing gown lined with blue silk, 
                tied the tassels in a knot, and, drawing a deep breath of air 
                into his broad chest, he walked to the window with his usual confident 
                step, turning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily. 
                He pulled up the blind and rang the bell loudly. It was at once 
                answered by the appearance of an old friend, his valet, Matvei, 
                carrying his clothes, his boots and a telegram. Matvei was followed 
                by the barber with all the necessaries for shaving. </p>
              <p> `Are there any papers from the board?' asked Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                taking the telegram and seating himself at the looking glass. 
              </p>
              <p> `On the table,' replied Matvei, glancing with inquiring sympathy 
                at his master; and, after a short pause, he added with a sly smile: 
              </p>
              <p> `They've sent from the carriage jobber.' </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich made no reply, but merely glanced at Matvei 
                in the looking glass. The glance, in which their eyes met in the 
                looking glass, made it clear that they understood one another. 
                Stepan Arkadyevich's eyes seemed to ask: `Why do you tell me that? 
                Don't you know?' </p>
              <p> Matvei put his hands in his jacket pockets, thrust out one leg, 
                and gazed silently, with a good-humored, faint smile, at his master. 
              </p>
              <p> `I told them to come on Sunday, and till then not to trouble 
                you or themselves for nothing,' he said. He had obviously prepared 
                the sentence beforehand. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich saw Matvei wanted to make a joke and attract 
                attention to himself. Tearing open the telegram, he read it through, 
                guessing at the words, misspelled as they always are in telegrams, 
                and his face brightened. </p>
              <p> `Matvei, my sister Anna Arkadyevna will be here tomorrow,' he 
                said, checking for a minute the sleek, plump hand of the barber, 
                cutting a pink path between his long, curly side whiskers. </p>
              <p> `Thank God!' said Matvei, showing by this response that he, 
                like his master, realized the significance of this arrival: Anna 
                Arkadyevna, the sister his master was so fond of, might bring 
                about a reconciliation between husband and wife. </p>
              <p> `Alone, or with her husband?' inquired Matvei. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich could not answer, as the barber was at work 
                on his upper lip, and he raised one finger. Matvei nodded at the 
                looking glass. </p>
              <p> `Alone. Is the room to be got ready upstairs?' </p>
              <p> `Inform Darya Alexandrovna: where she orders.' </p>
              <p> `Darya Alexandrovna?' Matvei repeated, as though in doubt. </p>
              <p> `Yes, inform her. Here, take the telegram; give it to her, and 
                then do what she tells you.' </p>
              <p> `You want to try it out,' Matvei guessed, but only said: `Yes, 
                sir.' </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich was already washed and combed and ready to 
                be dressed, when Matvei, stepping slowly in his creaky boots, 
                came back into the room with the telegram in his hand. The barber 
                had gone. </p>
              <p> `Darya Alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going 
                away. ``Let him'' - that is you - ``do as he likes,''' he said, 
                laughing only with his eyes, and, putting his hands in his pockets, 
                he watched his master with his head on one side. Stepan Arkadyevich 
                was silent a minute. Then a good-humored and rather pitiful smile 
                showed itself on his handsome face. </p>
              <p> `Eh, Matvei?' he said, shaking his head. </p>
              <p> `Never mind, sir; everything will come round,' said Matvei. 
              </p>
              <p> `Come round?' </p>
              <p> `Just so, sir.' </p>
              <p> `Do you think so? - Who's there?' asked Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                hearing the rustle of a woman's dress at the door. </p>
              <p> `It's I,' said a firm, pleasant feminine voice, and the stern, 
                pockmarked face of Matriona Philimonovna, the nurse, was thrust 
                in at the door. </p>
              <p> `Well, what's the matter, Matriosha?' queried Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                meeting her in the doorway. </p>
              <p> Although Stepan Arkadyevich was completely in the wrong as regards 
                his wife, and was conscious of this himself, almost everyone in 
                the house (even the nurse, Darya Alexandrovna's chief ally) was 
                on his side. </p>
              <p> `Well, what now?' he asked cheerlessly. </p>
              <p> `Go to her, sir; own your fault again. Maybe God will aid you. 
                She is suffering so, it's pitiful to see her; and besides, everything 
                in the house is topsy-turvy. You must have pity, sir, on the children. 
                Beg her forgiveness, sir. There's no help for it! One must pay 
                the piper....' </p>
              <p> `But she won't see me.' </p>
              <p> `You do your part. God is merciful; pray to God, sir - pray 
                to God.' </p>
              <p> `Come, that'll do, you can go,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, blushing 
                suddenly. `Well, now, let's dress,' he turned to Matvei and resolutely 
                threw off his dressing gown. </p>
              <p> Matvei was already holding up the shirt like a horse's collar, 
                and, blowing off some invisible speck, he slipped it with obvious 
                pleasure over the well-cared-for person of his master. </p>

              <p> <br>
                That which to Vronsky had been for almost a whole year the one 
                absorbing desire of his life, replacing all his old desires; that 
                which to Anna had been an impossible, terrible, and, for that 
                very reason, a more entrancing dream of happiness - that desire 
                had been fulfilled. He stood before her, pale, his lower jaw quivering, 
                and besought her to be calm, without himself knowing how or why. 
              </p>
              <p>`Anna! Anna!' he said with a quivering voice, `Anna, for God's 
                sake!...' </p>
              <p> But the louder he spoke, the lower she cast down her once proud 
                and gay, but now shame-stricken head, and she bowed down and sank 
                from the sofa where she was sitting - down on the floor, at his 
                feet; she would have fallen on the carpet if he had not held her. 
              </p>
              <p> `My God!' Forgive me!' she said, sobbing, pressing his hands 
                to her bosom. </p>
              <p> She felt so sinful, so guilty, that nothing was left her but 
                to humiliate herself and beg forgiveness, and as now there was 
                no one in her life but him, to him, too, she addressed her prayer 
                for forgiveness. Looking at him, she had a physical sense of her 
                humiliation, and she could say nothing more. And he felt as a 
                murderer must feel when he beholds the body he has robbed of life. 
                That body, robbed by him of life, was their love, the first stage 
                of their love. There was something awful and revolting in the 
                memory of what had been bought at this fearful price of shame. 
                Shame at her spiritual nakedness crushed her and infected him. 
                But in spite of all the murderer's horror before the body of his 
                victim, he must hack it to pieces, hide the body, must use what 
                the murderer had gained by his murder. </p>
              <p> And as the murderer, with fury, and, as it were, with passion, 
                falls on the body, and drags it, and hacks at it - so he covered 
                her face and shoulders with kisses. She held his hand, and did 
                not stir. Yes, these kisses - that is what has been bought by 
                this shame. Yes, and this one hand, which will always be mine 
                - the hand of my accomplice. She lifted up that hand and kissed 
                it. He sank on his knees and tried to see her face; but she hid 
                it, and said nothing. At last, as though making an effort over 
                herself, she got up and pushed him away. Her face was still as 
                beautiful, but it was only the more pitiful for that. </p>
              <p> `All is over,' she said; `I have nothing but you. Remember that.' 
              </p>
              <p> `I can never forget what is my whole life. For one instant of 
                this happiness...' </p>
              <p> `Happiness!' she said with horror and loathing and her horror 
                unconsciously infected him. `For God's sake, not a word, not a 
                word more.' </p>
              <p> She rose quickly and moved away from him. </p>
              <p> `Not a word more,' she repeated, and with a look of chill despair, 
                incomprehensible to him, she parted from him. She felt that at 
                that moment she could not put into words the sense of shame, of 
                rapture, and of horror at this stepping into a new life, and she 
                did not want to speak of it, to vulgarize this feeling by inappropriate 
                words. But later too, and the next day, and the day after, she 
                still found no words in which she could express the complexity 
                of those feelings; indeed, she could not even find thoughts in 
                which she could clearly think out all that was in her soul. </p>
              <p> She said to herself. `No, just now I can't think of it - later 
                on, when I am calmer.' But this calm for thoughts never came; 
                every time the thought rose of what she had done and what would 
                happen to her, and what she ought to do, a horror came over her 
                and she drove those thoughts away. </p>
              <p> `Later, later,' she said, `when I am calmer.' </p>
              <p> But in her dreams, when she had no control over her thoughts, 
                her position presented itself to her in all its hideous nakedness. 
                One dream haunted her almost every night. She dreamed that both 
                were husbands at once, that both were lavishing caresses on her. 
                Alexei Alexandrovich was weeping, kissing her hands, and saying, 
                `How happy we are now!' And Alexei Vronsky was there too, and 
                he, too, was her husband. And she was marveling that it had once 
                seemed impossible to her, was explaining to them, laughing, that 
                this was ever so much simpler, and that now both of them were 
                happy and contented. But this dream weighed on her like a nightmare, 
                and she would awake from it in terror. </p>

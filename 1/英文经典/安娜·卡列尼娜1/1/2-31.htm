              <p align="center" class="h">Chapter 31</p>
              <p><br>
                It was a foul day; it had been raining all the morning, and the 
                invalids, with their parasols, had flocked into the arcades. </p>
              <p>Kitty was walking there with her mother and the Moscow colonel, 
                smart and jaunty in his European coat, bought ready-made at Frankfort. 
                They were walking on one side of the arcade, trying to avoid Levin, 
                who was walking on the other side. Varenka, in her dark dress, 
                in a black hat with a turndown brim, was walking up and down the 
                whole length of the arcade with a blind Frenchwoman, and, every 
                time she met Kitty, they exchanged friendly glances. </p>
              <p> `Mamma, couldn't I speak to her?' said Kitty, watching her unknown 
                friend, and noticing that she was going up to the spring, and 
                that they might come there together. </p>
              <p> `Oh, if you want to so much, I'll find out about her first and 
                make her acquaintance myself,' answered her mother. `What do you 
                see in her out of the way? A companion, most probably. If you 
                like, I'll make acquaintance with Madame Stahl; I used to know 
                her belle-soeur,' added the Princess, lifting her head haughtily. 
              </p>
              <p> Kitty knew that the Princess was offended because Madame Stahl 
                had apparently avoided making her acquaintance. Kitty did not 
                insist. </p>
              <p> `How wonderfully sweet she is!' she said, gazing at Varenka 
                just as she handed a glass to the Frenchwoman. `Look how natural 
                and sweet it all is.' </p>
              <p> `It's so funny to see your engouements,' said the Princess. 
                `No, we'd better go back,' she added, noticing Levin coming toward 
                them with his companion and a German doctor, to whom he was talking 
                very noisily and angrily. </p>
              <p> They turned to go back, when suddenly they heard, not merely 
                noisy talk, but actual shouting. Levin, stopping short, was shouting 
                at the doctor, and the doctor, too, was excited. A crowd gathered 
                about them. The Princess and Kitty beat a hasty retreat, while 
                the colonel joined the crowd to find out what was up. </p>
              <p> A few minutes later the colonel overtook them. </p>
              <p> `What was it?' inquired the Princess. </p>
              <p> `Scandalous and disgraceful!' answered the colonel. `The one 
                thing to be dreaded is meeting Russians abroad. That tall gentleman 
                was abusing the doctor, flinging all sorts of insults at him because 
                he wasn't treating him quite as he liked, and he began waving 
                his stick at him. It's simply scandalous!' </p>
              <p> `Oh, how unpleasant!' said the Princess. `Well, and how did 
                it end?' </p>
              <p> `Luckily at that point that miss... the one in the mushroom 
                hat... intervened. She is a Russian lady, I think,' said the colonel. 
              </p>
              <p> `Mademoiselle Varenka?' Kitty asked joyously. </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes. She came to the rescue before anyone else; she took 
                the man by the arm and led him away.' </p>
              <p> `There, mamma,' said Kitty, `yet you wonder why I'm enthusiastic 
                about her.' </p>
              <p> The next day, as she watched her unknown friend, Kitty noticed 
                that Mademoiselle Varenka was already on the same terms with Levin 
                and his companion as with her other proteges. She went up to them, 
                entered into conversation with them, and served as interpreter 
                for the woman, who could not speak any foreign language. </p>
              <p> Kitty began to entreat her mother still more urgently to let 
                her make acquaintance with Varenka. And, disagreeable as it was 
                to the Princess to seem to take the first step in wishing to make 
                the acquaintance of Madame Stahl, who thought fit to give herself 
                airs, she made inquiries about Varenka, and, having ascertained 
                particulars about her tending to prove that there could he no 
                harm, even if little good in the acquaintance, she herself approached 
                Varenka and made acquaintance with her. </p>
              <p> Choosing a time when her daughter had gone to the spring, while 
                Varenka had stopped outside the baker's, the Princess approached 
                her. </p>
              <p> `Allow me to make your acquaintance,' she said, with her dignified 
                smile. `My daughter has lost her heart to you,' she said. `Possibly 
                you do not know me. I am...' </p>
              <p> `That feeling is more than reciprocal, Princess,' Varenka answered 
                hurriedly. </p>
              <p> `What a good deed you did yesterday to our poor compatriot!' 
                said the Princess. </p>
              <p> Varenka flushed a little. </p>
              <p> `I don't remember. I don't think I did anything,' she said. 
              </p>
              <p> `Why, you saved that Levin from disagreeable consequences.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, sa compagne called me, and I tried to pacify him; he's 
                very ill, and was dissatisfied with the doctor. I'm used to looking 
                after such invalids.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, I've heard you live at Mentone with your aunt - I think 
                - Madame Stahl: I used to know her belle-soeur.' </p>
              <p> `No, she's not my aunt. I call her maman, but I am not related 
                to her; I was brought up by her,' answered Varenka, flushing a 
                little again. </p>
              <p> This was so simply said, and so sweet was the truthful and candid 
                expression of her face, that the Princess saw why Kitty had taken 
                such a fancy to Varenka. </p>
              <p> `Well, and what's this Levin going to do?' asked the Princess. 
              </p>
              <p> `He's going away,' answered Varenka. </p>
              <p> At that instant Kitty came up from the spring beaming with delight 
                because her mother had become acquainted with her unknown friend. 
              </p>
              <p> `See, Kitty, your intense desire to make friends with Mademoiselle...' 
              </p>
              <p> `Varenka,' Varenka put in smiling, `that's what everyone calls 
                me.' </p>
              <p> Kitty blushed with pleasure, and slowly, without speaking, squeezed 
                her new friend's hand, which did not respond to her pressure, 
                but lay motionless in her hand. The hand did not respond to her 
                pressure, but the face of Mademoiselle Varenka glowed with a soft, 
                glad, though rather mournful, smile, that showed large but handsome 
                teeth. </p>
              <p> `I have long wished for this too,' she said. </p>
              <p> `But `But you are so busy...' </p>
              <p> `Oh, no I'm not at all busy,' answered Varenka, but at that 
                moment she had to leave her new friends because two little Russian 
                girls, children of an invalid, ran up to her. </p>
              <p> `Varenka, mamma's calling!' they cried. </p>
              <p> And Varenka went after them. </p>

                The temporary stable, a wooden booth, had been put up close to 
                the racecourse, and there his mare was to have been taken the 
                previous day. He had not yet seen her there. During the last few 
                days he had not ridden her out for exercise himself, but had put 
                her in the charge of the trainer, and so now he absolutely did 
                not know in what condition his mare had arrived yesterday or was 
                in today. He had scarcely got out of his carriage when his stableboy 
                (groom), recognizing the carriage some way off, called the trainer. 
                A dry-looking Englishman, in high boots and a short jacket, clean-shaven, 
                except for a tuft below his chin, came to meet him walking with 
                the uncouth gait of a jockey, turning his elbows out and swaying 
                from side to side. </p>
              <p>`Well, how's Frou-Frou?' Vronsky asked in English. </p>
              <p> `All right, sir,' the Englishman's voice responded somewhere 
                far down in his throat. `Better not go in,' he added, touching 
                his hat. `I've put a muzzle on her, and the mare's fidgety. Better 
                not go in, it'll excite the mare.' </p>
              <p> `No, I'm going in. I want to look at her.' </p>
              <p> `Come along, then,' said the Englishman, frowning, and speaking 
                with his mouth shut, and, with swinging elbows, he went on in 
                front with his disjointed gait. </p>
              <p> They went into the little yard in front of the shed. The stableboy 
                on duty, spruce and smart in his holiday attire, met them with 
                a broom in his hand, and followed them. In the shed there were 
                five horses in their separate stalls, and Vronsky knew that his 
                chief rival, Makhotin's Gladiator, a very tall chestnut horse, 
                had been brought there, and must be standing among them. Even 
                more than his mare, Vronsky longed to see Gladiator, whom he had 
                never seen, but Vronsky knew that by the etiquette of the racecourse 
                it was not merely impossible for him to see the horse, but improper 
                even to ask questions about him. just as he was passing along 
                the passage, the boy opened the door into the second horsebox 
                on the left, and Vronsky caught a glimpse of a big chestnut horse 
                with white legs. He knew that this was Gladiator, but, with the 
                feeling of a man turning away from the sight of another man's 
                open letter, he turned round and went into Frou-Frou's stall. 
              </p>
              <p> `The stall belonging to Ma-k... Mak... I never can say the name 
                - is here,' said the Englishman over his shoulder, pointing his 
                dirty-nailed thumb toward Gladiator's stall. </p>
              <p> `Makhotin? Yes, he's my most serious rival,' said Vronsky. </p>
              <p> `If you were riding him,' said the Englishman, `I'd bet on you. 
              </p>
              <p> `Frou-Frou's more nervous, while the other is more powerful,' 
                said Vronsky, smiling at the compliment to his riding. </p>
              <p> `In a steeplechase it all depends on riding and on pluck,' said 
                the Englishman. </p>
              <p> Of pluck - that is, energy and courage - Vronsky did not merely 
                feel that he had enough; what was of far more importance, he was 
                firmly convinced that no one in the world could have more of this 
                pluck than he had. </p>
              <p> `Don't you think I want more sweating down?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, no,' answered the Englishman. `Please, don't speak loud. 
                The mare's fidgety,' he added, nodding toward the horse box, before 
                which they were standing, and from which came the sound of restless 
                stamping in the straw. </p>
              <p> He opened the door, and Vronsky went into the horse box, dimly 
                lighted by one little window. In the horse box stood a dark bay 
                mare, with a muzzle on, shifting her feet on the fresh straw. 
                Looking round him in the twilight of the horse box, Vronsky unconsciously 
                took in once more in a comprehensive glance all the points of 
                his favorite mare. Frou-Frou was an animal of medium size, not 
                altogether free from reproach, from a breeder's point of view. 
                She was small-boned all over; though her chest was extremely prominent 
                in front, it was narrow. Her hindquarters were a little drooping, 
                and in her forelegs, and still more in her hind legs, there was 
                a noticeable curvature. The muscles of both hind legs and forelegs 
                were not very thick; but across her shoulders the mare was exceptionally 
                broad, a peculiarity specially striking now that she was lean 
                from training. The bones of her legs below the knees looked no 
                thicker than a finger from in front, but were extraordinarily 
                thick seen from the side. She looked altogether, except across 
                the shoulders, apparently pinched in at the sides and pressed 
                out in depth. But she had in the highest degree the quality that 
                makes all defects forgotten: that quality was blood, the blood 
                that tells, as the English expression has it. The muscles stood 
                up sharply under the network of sinews, covered with the delicate, 
                mobile skin, soft as satin, and they were hard as bone. Her clean-cut 
                head, with prominent, bright, spirited eyes, broadened out at 
                the open nostrils, that showed the red blood in the cartilage 
                within. About all her figure, and especially her head, there was 
                a certain expression of energy, and, at the same time, of softness. 
                She was one of those creatures which seem devoid of speech only 
                because the mechanism of their mouths does not allow of it. </p>
              <p> To Vronsky, at any rate, it seemed that she understood all he 
                felt at that moment as he looked at her. </p>
              <p> Directly Vronsky went toward her, she drew in a deep breath, 
                and, turning back her prominent eye tin the white looked bloodshot, 
                she started at the approaching figures from the opposite side, 
                shaking her muzzle, and shifting lightly from one leg to the other. 
              </p>
              <p> `There, you see how fidgety she is,' said the Englishman. </p>
              <p> `Whoa, darling! Whoa!' said Vronsky, going up to the mare and 
                speaking soothingly to her. </p>
              <p> But the nearer he came, the more excited she grew. Only when 
                he stood by her head she was suddenly quieter, while the muscles 
                quivered under her soft, delicate coat. Vronsky patted her strong 
                neck, straightened over her sharp withers a stray lock of her 
                mane that had fallen on the other side, and moved his face near 
                her dilated nostrils, transparent as a bat's wing. She drew a 
                loud breath and snorted out through her tense nostrils, started, 
                pricked up her sharp ear, and put out her strong, black lip toward 
                Vronsky, as though she would nip hold of his sleeve. But remembering 
                the muzzle, she shook it and again began restlessly stamping her 
                shapely legs one after the other. </p>
              <p> `Calm down, darling, calm down!' he said, patting her again 
                over her hindquarters; and, with a glad sense that his mare was 
                in the best possible condition, he went out of the horse box. 
              </p>
              <p> The mare's excitement had infected Vronsky. He felt that his 
                heart was throbbing, and that he, too, like the mare, longed to 
                move, to bite; it was both fearful and delicious. </p>
              <p> `Well, I rely on you, then,' he said to the Englishman, `half-past 
                six on the ground.' </p>
              <p> `All right,' said the Englishman. `Oh, where are you going, 
                my lord?' he asked suddenly, using the title my lord, which he 
                scarcely ever used. </p>
              <p> Vronsky in amazement raised his head, and stared, as he knew 
                how to stare, not into the Englishman's eyes, but at his forehead, 
                astounded at the impertinence of his question. But realizing that 
                in asking this the Englishman had been looking at him not as an 
                employer, but as a jockey, he answered: </p>
              <p> `I've got to go to Briansky's; I shall be home within an hour.' 
              </p>
              <p> `How often I'm asked that question today!' he said to himself, 
                and he blushed, a thing which rarely happened to him. The Englishman 
                looked gravely at him; and, as though he, too, knew where Vronsky 
                was going, he added: </p>
              <p> `The great thing is to keep quiet before a race,' said he; `don't 
                get out of temper, or upset about anything.' </p>
              <p> `All right,' answered Vronsky, smiling; and, jumping into his 
                carriage, he told the man to drive to Peterhof. </p>
              <p> Before he had driven many paces away, the dark clouds that had 
                been threatening rain all day broke, and there was a heavy downpour 
                of rain. </p>
              <p> `What a pity!' thought Vronsky, putting up the roof of the carriage. 
                `It was muddy before, now it will be a perfect swamp.' As he sat 
                in solitude in the closed carriage, he took out his mother's letter 
                and his brother's note, and read them through. </p>
              <p> Yes, it was the same thing over and over again. Everyone - his 
                mother, his brother - everyone thought fit to interfere in the 
                affairs of his heart. This interference aroused in him a feeling 
                of angry hatred - a feeling he had rarely known before. `What 
                business is it of theirs? Why does everybody feel called upon 
                to concern himself about me? And why do they worry me so? Just 
                because they see that this is something they can't understand. 
                If it were a common, vulgar, worldly intrigue, they would have 
                left me alone. They feel that this is something different, that 
                this is not a mere pastime, that this woman is dearer to me than 
                life. And this is incomprehensible, and that's why it annoys them. 
                Whatever our destiny is or may be, we have made it ourselves, 
                and we do not complain of it,' he said, in the word we linking 
                himself with Anna. `No, they must needs teach us how to live. 
                They haven't an idea of what happiness is; they don't know that 
                without our love there is for us neither happiness nor unhappiness 
                - no life at all,' he thought. </p>
              <p> He was angry with all of them for their interference just because 
                he felt in his soul that they, all these people, were right. He 
                felt that the love that bound him to Anna was not a momentary 
                impulse, which would pass, as worldly intrigues do pass, leaving 
                no other traces in the life of either save pleasant or unpleasant 
                memories. He felt all the torture of his own position and hers, 
                all the difficulty in store for them, conspicuous as they were 
                in the eye of all the world - in concealing their love, in lying 
                and deceiving; and in lying, deceiving, feigning and continually 
                thinking of others, when the passion that united them was so intense 
                that they were both oblivious of everything else save their love. 
              </p>
              <p> He vividly recalled all the constantly recurring instances of 
                inevitable necessity for lying and deceit, which were so against 
                his natural bent. He recalled particularly vividly the shame he 
                had more than once detected in her at this necessity for lying 
                and deceit. And he experienced the strange feeling that had sometimes 
                come upon him since his relations with Anna. This was a feeling 
                of loathing for something - whether for Alexei Alexandrovich, 
                or for himself, or for the whole world, he could not have said. 
                But he always drove away this strange feeling. Now, too, he shook 
                it off and continued the thread of his thoughts. </p>
              <p> `Yes, she was unhappy before, but proud and at peace; and now 
                she cannot be at peace and feel secure in her dignity, though 
                she does not show it. Yes, we must put an end to it,' he decided. 
              </p>
              <p> And for the first time the idea clearly presented itself that 
                it was essential to put an end to this false position, and the 
                sooner the better. `Abandon everything must we - she and I - and 
                hide ourselves somewhere alone with our love,' he said to himself.

              <p><br>
                None but those who were most intimate with Alexei Alexandrovich 
                knew that, while on the surface the coldest and most rational 
                of men, he had one weakness quite opposed to the general trend 
                of his character. Alexei Alexandrovich could not hear or see a 
                child or woman crying without being moved. The sight of tears 
                threw him into a state of nervous agitation, and he utterly lost 
                all power of reflection. The head clerk of his board and the secretary 
                were aware of this, and used to warn women who came with petitions 
                on no account to give way to tears, if they did not want to ruin 
                their chances. `He will get angry, and will not listen to you,' 
                they used to say. And, as a fact, in such cases the emotional 
                disturbance set up in Alexei Alexandrovich by the sight of tears 
                found expression in hasty anger. `I can do nothing. Kindly leave 
                the room!' he would usually shout in such cases. <br>
                When, returning from the races, Anna had informed him of her relations 
                with Vronsky, and immediately afterward had burst into tears, 
                hiding her face in her hands, Alexei Alexandrovich, for all the 
                fury aroused in him against her, was aware at the same time of 
                a rush of that emotional disturbance always produced in him by 
                tears. Conscious of it, and conscious that any expression of his 
                feelings at that minute would be out of keeping with the situation, 
                he tried to suppress every manifestation of life in himself, and 
                so neither stirred nor looked at her. This was what had caused 
                that strange expression of deathlike rigidity in his face which 
                had so impressed Anna. </p>
              <p> When they reached the house he helped her to get out of the 
                carriage, and, making an effort to master himself, took leave 
                of her with his usual urbanity, and uttered that phrase that bound 
                him to nothing; he said that tomorrow he would let her know his 
                decision. </p>
              <p> His wife's words, confirming his worst suspicions, had sent 
                a cruel pang to the heart of Alexei Alexandrovich. That pang was 
                intensified by the strange feeling of physical pity for her engendered 
                by her tears. But when he was all alone in the carriage Alexei 
                Alexandrovich, to his surprise and delight, felt complete relief 
                both from this pity and from the doubts and agonies of jealousy. 
              </p>
              <p> He experienced the sensations of a man who has had a tooth out 
                after suffering long from toothache. After a fearful agony and 
                a sense of something huge, bigger than the head itself, being 
                torn out of his jaw, the sufferer, hardly able to believe in his 
                own good luck, feels all at once that what has so long envenomed 
                his existence and enchained his attention, exists no longer, and 
                that he can live and think again, and take an interest in other 
                things besides his tooth. This feeling Alexei Alexandrovich was 
                experiencing. The agony had been strange and terrible, but now 
                it was over; he felt that he could live again and think of something 
                other than his wife. </p>
              <p> `No honor, no heart, no religion; a corrupt woman. I always 
                knew it and always saw it, though I tried to deceive myself to 
                spare her,' he said to himself. And it actually seemed to him 
                that he always had seen it: he recalled incidents of their past 
                life, in which he had never seen anything wrong before - now these 
                incidents proved clearly that she had always been a corrupt woman. 
                `I made a mistake in linking my life to hers; but there was nothing 
                wrong in my mistake, and so I cannot be unhappy. It's not I who 
                am to blame,' he told himself, `but she. But I have nothing to 
                do with her. She does not exist for me.' </p>
              <p> All that would befall her and her son, toward whom his sentiments 
                were as much changed as toward her, ceased to interest him. The 
                only thing that interested him now was the question in what way 
                he could best, with most propriety and comfort for himself, and 
                so with most justice, shake clear the mud with which she had spattered 
                him in her fall, and then proceed along his path of active, honorable, 
                and useful existence. </p>
              <p> `I cannot be made unhappy by the fact that a contemptible woman 
                has committed a crime. I have only to find the best way out of 
                the difficult position in which she has placed me. And I shall 
                find it,' he said to himself, frowning more and more. `I'm neither 
                the first nor the last.' And to say nothing of historical instances 
                dating from Menelaus, recently revived in the memory of all by 
                La Belle H¨¦l¨¨ne, a whole list of contemporary examples of husbands 
                with unfaithful wives in the highest society rose before Alexei 
                Alexandrovich's imagination. `Daryalov, Poltavsky, Prince Karibanov, 
                Count Paskudin, Dram... Yes, even Dram... such an honest, capable 
                fellow... Semionov, Chagin, Sigonin,' Alexei Alexandrovich remembered. 
                `Admitting that a certain quite irrational ridicule falls to the 
                lot of these men, yet I never saw anything but a misfortune in 
                it, and always felt sympathy for it,' Alexei Alexandrovich said 
                to himself, though indeed this was not the fact, and he had never 
                felt sympathy for misfortunes of that kind, but the more often 
                he had heard of instances of unfaithful wives betraying their 
                husbands, the more highly he had thought of himself. `It is a 
                misfortune which may befall anyone. And this misfortune has befallen 
                me. The only thing to be done is to make the best of the situation.' 
                And he began passing in review the methods of proceeding of men 
                who had been in the same position that he was in. </p>
              <p> `Daryalov fought a duel....' </p>
              <p> The duel had particularly fascinated the thoughts of Alexei 
                Alexandrovich in his youth, just because he was physically a fainthearted 
                man, and was himself well aware of the fact. Alexei Alexandrovich 
                could not without horror contemplate the idea of a pistol aimed 
                at himself, and never made use of any weapon in his life. This 
                horror had in his youth set him often pondering on dueling, and 
                picturing himself in a position in which he would have to expose 
                his life to danger. Having attained success and an established 
                position in the world, he had long ago forgotten this feeling; 
                but the habitual bent of feeling reasserted itself, and dread 
                of his own cowardice proved even now so strong that Alexei Alexandrovich 
                spent a long while thinking over the question of dueling in all 
                its aspects, and hugging the idea of a duel, though he was fully 
                aware beforehand that he would never under any circumstances fight 
                one. </p>
              <p> `There's no doubt our society is still so barbarous (it's not 
                the same in England) that very many' - and among these were those 
                whose opinion Alexei Alexandrovich particularly valued - `look 
                favorably on the duel; but what result is attained by it? Suppose 
                I call him out,' Alexei Alexandrovich went on to himself, and 
                vividly picturing the night he would spend after the challenge, 
                and the pistol aimed at him, he shuddered, and knew that he never 
                would do it - `suppose I call him out. Suppose I am taught,' he 
                went on musing, `I am placed, I press the trigger,' he said to 
                himself, closing his eyes, `and it turns out I have killed him,' 
                Alexei Alexandrovich said to himself, and he shook his head as 
                though to dispel such silly ideas. `What sense is there in murdering 
                a man in order to define one's relation to a guilty wife and son? 
                I should still have to decide what I ought to do with her. But 
                what is more probable, and what would doubtlessly occur - I should 
                be killed or wounded. I, the innocent person, should be the victim 
                - killed or wounded. It's even more senseless. But, apart from 
                that, a challenge to fight would be an act hardly honest on my 
                side. Don't I know beforehand that my friends would never allow 
                me to fight a duel - would never allow the life of a statesman, 
                needed by Russia, to be exposed to danger? What would come of 
                it? It would come of it that, knowing beforehand that the matter 
                would never come to real danger, it would amount to my simply 
                trying to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge. 
                That would be dishonest, that would be false, that would be deceiving 
                myself and others. A duel is quite impossible, and no one expects 
                it of me. My aim is simply to safeguard my reputation, which is 
                essential for the uninterrupted pursuit of my public duties.' 
                Official duties, which had always been of great consequence in 
                Alexei Alexandrovich's eyes, seemed of special importance to his 
                mind at this moment. </p>
              <p> Considering and rejecting the duel, Alexei Alexandrovich turned 
                to divorce - another solution selected by several of the husbands 
                he remembered. Passing in mental review all the instances he knew 
                of divorces (there were plenty of them in the very highest society 
                with which he was very familiar), Alexei Alexandrovich could not 
                find a single example in which the object of divorce was that 
                which he had in view. In all these instances the husband had practically 
                ceded or sold his unfaithful wife, and the very party who, being 
                in fault, had not the right to contract a marriage, had formed 
                counterfeit, pseudo-matrimonial ties with a new husband. In his 
                own case, Alexei Alexandrovich saw that a legal divorce, that 
                is to say, one in which only the guilty wife would be repudiated, 
                was impossible of attainment. He saw that the complex conditions 
                of the life they led made the coarse proofs of his wife's guilt, 
                required by the law, out of the question; he saw that a certain 
                refinement in that life would not admit of such proofs being brought 
                forward, even if he had them, and that to bring forward such proofs 
                would damage him in the public estimation more than it would her. 
              </p>
              <p> An attempt at divorce could lead to nothing but a public scandal, 
                which would be a perfect godsend to his enemies for calumny and 
                attacks on his high position in society. His chief object, to 
                define the position with the least amount of disturbance possible, 
                would not be attained by divorce either. Moreover, in the event 
                of divorce, or even of an attempt to obtain a divorce, it was 
                obvious that the wife broke off all relations with the husband 
                and threw in her lot with the lover. And, in spite of the complete, 
                as he supposed, contempt and indifference he now felt for his 
                wife, at the bottom of his heart Alexei Alexandrovich still had 
                one feeling left in regard to her - a disinclination to see her 
                free to throw in her lot with Vronsky, so that her crime would 
                be to her advantage. The mere notion of this so exasperated Alexei 
                Alexandrovich, that directly it rose to his mind he groaned with 
                inward agony, and got up and changed his place in the carriage, 
                and for a long while after he sat with scowling brows, wrapping 
                his numbed and bony legs in the fleecy rug. </p>
              <p> `Apart from formal divorce, one might still do as Karibanov, 
                Paskudin, and that good fellow Dram did - that is, separate from 
                one's wife,' he went on thinking, when he had regained his composure. 
                But this step too presented the same drawback of public scandal 
                as a divorce, and, what was more, a separation, quite as much 
                as a regular divorce, flung his wife into the arms of Vronsky. 
                `No, it's out of the question, out of the question!' he said aloud, 
                twisting his rug about him again. `I cannot be unhappy, but neither 
                she nor he ought to be happy.' </p>
              <p> The feeling of jealousy, which had tortured him during the period 
                of uncertainty, had passed away at the instant when, with agony, 
                the tooth had been extracted by his wife's words. But that feeling 
                had been replaced by another - the desire, not merely that she 
                should not triumph, but that she should get due punishment for 
                her crime. He did not acknowledge this feeling, but at the bottom 
                of his heart he longed for her to suffer for having destroyed 
                his peace of mind, and having dishonored him. And once again going 
                over the conditions inseparable from a duel, a divorce, a separation, 
                and once again rejecting them, Alexei Alexandrovich felt convinced 
                that there was only one solution - to keep her with him, concealing 
                what had happened from the world, and using every measure in his 
                power to break off the intrigue, and still more - though this 
                he did not admit to himself - to punish her. `I must communicate 
                to her my decision; that, thinking over the terrible position 
                in which she has placed her family, all other solutions will be 
                worse for both sides than an external status quo, and that such 
                I agree to retain, on the strict condition of obedience on her 
                part to my wishes - that is to say, cessation of all intercourse 
                with her lover.' When this decision had been finally adopted, 
                another weighty consideration occurred to Alexei Alexandrovich 
                in support of it. `By such a course only shall I be acting in 
                accordance with the dictates of religion,' he told himself. `In 
                adopting this course, I am not casting off a guilty wife, but 
                giving her a chance of amendment; and, indeed, difficult as the 
                task will be to me, I shall devote part of my energies to her 
                reformation and salvation.' Though Alexei Alexandrovich was perfectly 
                aware that he could not exert any moral influence over his wife, 
                that such an attempt at reformation could lead to nothing but 
                falsity; though in passing through these difficult moments he 
                had not once thought of seeking guidance in religion; yet now, 
                when his conclusion corresponded, as it seemed to him, with the 
                requirements of religion, this religious sanction to his decision 
                gave him complete satisfaction, and to some extent restored his 
                peace of mind. He was pleased to think that, even in such an important 
                crisis in life, no one would be able to say that he had not acted 
                in accordance with the principles of that religion whose banner 
                he had always held aloft amid the general coolness and indifference. 
                As he pondered over subsequent developments, Alexei Alexandrovich 
                did not see, indeed, why his relations with his wife should not 
                remain practically the same as before. No doubt, she could never 
                regain his esteem, but there was not, and there could not be, 
                any sort of reason why his existence should be troubled, and why 
                he should suffer because she was a bad and faithless wife. `Yes, 
                time will pass - time, which arranges all things; and the old 
                relations will be reestablished,' Alexei Alexandrovich told himself;

              <p><br>
                Vronsky's life was particularly happy in that he had a code of 
                principles, which defined with unfailing certitude what he ought 
                and what he ought not to do. This code of principles covered only 
                a very small circle of contingencies, but then the principles 
                were never doubtful, and Vronsky, as he never went outside that 
                circle, had never had a moment's hesitation about doing what he 
                ought to do. These principles laid down as invariable rules: that 
                one must pay a cardsharper, but need not pay a tailor; that one 
                must never tell a lie to a man, but one may to a woman; that one 
                must never cheat anyone, but one may a husband; that one must 
                never pardon an insult, but one may give one and so on. These 
                principles were possibly not reasonable and not good, but they 
                were of unfailing certainty, and, so long as he adhered to them, 
                Vronsky felt that his heart was at peace and he could hold his 
                head up. But of late, in regard to his relations with Anna, Vronsky 
                had begun to feel that his code of principles did not fully cover 
                all possible contingencies, and to foresee in the future difficulties 
                and perplexities for which he could find no guiding clue. <br>
                His present relation to Anna and to her husband was to his mind 
                clear and simple. It was clearly and precisely defined in the 
                code of principles by which he was guided. </p>
              <p> She was an honorable woman who had bestowed her love upon him, 
                and he loved her, and therefore she was in his eyes a woman who 
                had a right to the same respect, or even more, than a lawful wife. 
                He would have had his hand chopped off before he would have allowed 
                himself by a word, by a hint, to humiliate her, or even to fall 
                short of the fullest respect a woman could look for. </p>
              <p> His attitude toward society, too, was clear. Everyone might 
                know, might suspect it, but no one might dare to speak of it. 
                If any did speak, he was ready to force all who might do so to 
                be silent and to respect the nonexistent honor of the woman he 
                loved. </p>
              <p> His attitude to the husband was the clearest of all. From the 
                moment that Anna loved Vronsky, he had regarded his own right 
                over her as the one thing unassailable. Her husband was simply 
                a superfluous and tiresome person. No doubt he was in a pitiable 
                position, but how could that be helped? The one thing the husband 
                had a right to was to demand satisfaction with a weapon in his 
                hand, and Vronsky was prepared for this at any minute. </p>
              <p> But of late new inner relations had arisen between her and him, 
                which frightened Vronsky by their indefiniteness. Only the day 
                before she had told him that she was with child. And he felt that 
                this fact, and what she expected of him, called for something 
                not fully defined in that code of principles by which he had hitherto 
                steered his course in life. And he had been indeed caught unawares, 
                and, at the first moment when she spoke to him of her position, 
                his heart had prompted him to beg her to leave her husband. He 
                had said that, but now, thinking things over he saw clearly that 
                it would be better to manage avoiding that; and at the same time, 
                as he told himself this, he was afraid whether such an avoidance 
                were not wrong. </p>
              <p> `If I told her to leave her husband, it would mean uniting her 
                life with mine; am I prepared for that? How can I take her away 
                now, when I have no money? Supposing I could arrange... But how 
                can I take her away while I'm in the service? If I say it, I ought 
                to be prepared to do it; that is, I ought to have the money and 
                to retire from the army.' </p>
              <p> And he grew thoughtful. The question whether to retire from 
                the service or not brought him to the other, and perhaps the chief 
                though hidden, interest of his life, of which none knew but he. 
              </p>
              <p> Ambition was the old dream of his youth and childhood, a dream 
                which he did not confess even to himself, though it was so strong 
                that now this passion was even doing battle with his love. His 
                first steps in the world and in the service had been successful, 
                but two years before he had made a great mistake. Anxious to show 
                his independence, and for the sake of advancement, he had refused 
                a post that had been offered him, hoping that this refusal would 
                heighten his value; but it turned out that he had been too bold, 
                and he was passed over. And having, whether he liked or not, taken 
                up for himself the position of an independent man, he carried 
                it off with great tact and good sense, behaving as though he bore 
                no grudge against anyone, nor regarding himself as injured in 
                any way, and caring for nothing but to be left alone since he 
                was enjoying himself. In reality he had ceased to enjoy himself 
                as long ago as the year before, when he had gone to Moscow. He 
                felt that this independent attitude of a man who might have done 
                anything, but cared to do nothing, was already beginning to pall, 
                that many people were beginning to fancy that he was not really 
                capable of anything but being a straightforward, good-natured 
                fellow. His connection with Madame Karenina, by creating so much 
                sensation and attracting general attention, had given him a fresh 
                distinction, which had soothed his gnawing worm of ambition for 
                a while; but a week ago that worm had been roused up again with 
                fresh force. The friend of his childhood, a man of the same set, 
                of the same coterie, his comrade in the Corps of Pages, Serpukhovskoy, 
                who had left school with him, and had been his rival in class, 
                in gymnastics, in their scrapes and their dreams of glory, had 
                come back a few days before from Central Asia, where he had gained 
                two steps up in rank, and an order rarely bestowed upon generals 
                so young. </p>
              <p> As soon as he arrived in Peterburg, people began to talk about 
                him as a newly risen star of the first magnitude. A schoolfellow 
                of Vronsky's and of the same age, he was a general and was expecting 
                a command which might have influence on the course of political 
                events; while Vronsky, though he was independent and brilliant, 
                and beloved by a charming woman, was simply a cavalry captain 
                who was readily allowed to be as independent as ever he liked. 
                `Of course, I don't envy Serpukhovskoy and never could envy him; 
                but his advancement shows me that one has only to watch one's 
                opportunity, and the career of a man like me may be very rapidly 
                made. Three years ago he was in just the same position as I am. 
                If I retire, I burn my ships. If I remain in the army, I lose 
                nothing. She said herself she did not wish to change her position. 
                And with her love I cannot feel envious of Serpukhovskoy.' And, 
                slowly twirling his mustaches, he got up from the table and walked 
                about the room. His eyes shone particularly brightly, and he felt 
                in that firm, calm, and happy frame of mind which always came 
                after he had thoroughly faced his position. Everything was straight 
                and clear, just as after former days of striking balances. He 
                shaved, took a cold bath, dressed, and went out. </p>

                Vronsky had several times already, though not so resolutely as 
                now, tried to bring her to consider her position, and every time 
                he had been confronted by the same superficiality and frivolity 
                with which she met his appeal now. It was as though there were 
                something in this which she could not or would not face, as though 
                directly she began to speak of this, she, the real Anna, retreated 
                somehow into herself, and another strange and unaccountable woman 
                came out, whom he did not love and whom he feared, and who was 
                in opposition to him. But today he was resolved to have it out. 
              </p>
              <p>`Whether he knows or not,' said Vronsky, in his usual calm and 
                firm tone, `whether he knows or not, has nothing to do with us. 
                We cannot... You cannot stay like this, especially now.' </p>
              <p> `What's to be done, according to you?' she asked with the same 
                frivolous irony. She who had so feared he would take her condition 
                too frivolously, was now vexed with him for deducing from it the 
                necessity of taking some step. </p>
              <p> `Tell him everything, and leave him.' </p>
              <p> `Very well, let us suppose I do that,' she said. `Do you know 
                what the result of that would be? I can tell you it all beforehand,' 
                and a wicked light gleamed in her eyes, that had been so tender 
                a minute before. ```Eh, you love another man, and have entered 
                into a criminal liaison with him?'' (Mimicking her husband, she 
                threw an emphasis on the word `criminal,' as Alexei Alexandrovich 
                did.) ```I warned you of the results in the religious, the civil, 
                and the domestic aspects. You have not listened to me. Now I cannot 
                let you disgrace my name'' - `and my son,' she had meant to say, 
                but about her son she could not jest - ``disgrace my name, and'' 
                - and more in the same style,' she added. `In general terms, he'll 
                say in his official manner, and with all distinctness and precision, 
                that he cannot let me go, but will take all measures in his power 
                to prevent scandal. And he will calmly and punctiliously act in 
                accordance with his words. That's what will happen. He's not a 
                man, but a machine - and a spiteful machine when he's angry,' 
                she added, recalling Alexei Alexandrovich as she spoke, with all 
                the peculiarities of his figure and manner of speaking, and reckoning 
                against him every defect she could find in him, forgiving him 
                nothing for the great wrong she herself was doing him. </p>
              <p> `But, Anna,' said Vronsky, in a soft and persuasive voice, trying 
                to soothe her, `we absolutely must tell him, at any rate, and 
                then be guided by the line he takes.' </p>
              <p> `What - run away?' </p>
              <p> `And why not run away? I don't see how we can keep on like this. 
                And not for my sake - I see that you suffer.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, run away, and become your mistress,' she said angrily. 
              </p>
              <p> `Anna,' he said, with reproachful tenderness. </p>
              <p> `Yes,' she went on, `become your mistress, and complete the 
                ruin of...' </p>
              <p> Again she would have said `my son,' but she could not utter 
                that word. </p>
              <p> Vronsky could not understand how she, with her strong and truthful 
                nature, could endure this state of deceit, and not long to get 
                out of it. But he did not suspect that the chief cause of it was 
                the word son, which she could not utter. When she thought of her 
                son, and his future attitude to his mother, who had abandoned 
                his father, she felt such terror at what she had done that she 
                no longer reasoned, but, being a woman, could only try to comfort 
                herself with lying assurances and words so that everything should 
                remain as it always had been, and that it was possible to forget 
                the fearful question of how it would be with her son. </p>
              <p> `I beg you, I entreat you,' she said suddenly, taking his hand, 
                and speaking in quite a different tone, sincere and tender, `never 
                speak to me of that!' </p>
              <p> `But, Anna...' </p>
              <p> `Never. Leave it to me. I know all the baseness, all the horror 
                of my position; but it's not so easy to decide as you think. Therefore 
                leave it to me, and do what I say. Never speak to me of it. Do 
                you promise me?... No, no, promise!...' </p>
              <p> `I promise everything, but I can't be at peace, especially after 
                what you have told me I can't be at peace, when you can't be at 
                peace....' </p>
              <p> `I?' she repeated. `Yes, I am worried sometimes; but that will 
                pass, if you will never talk about this. When you talk about it 
                - it's only then it worries me.' </p>
              <p> `I don't understand,' he said. </p>
              <p> `I know,' she interrupted him, `how hard it is for your truthful 
                nature to lie, and I grieve for you. I often think, how could 
                you ruin your whole life for me.' </p>
              <p> `I was just thinking the very same thing,' he said; `how could 
                you sacrifice everything for my sake? I can't forgive myself because 
                you're unhappy.' </p>
              <p> `I unhappy?' she said, coming closer to him, and looking at 
                him with an ecstatic smile of love. `I am like a hungry man who 
                has been given food. He may be cold, and dressed in rags, and 
                ashamed, but he is not unhappy. I unhappy? No, this is my happiness....' 
              </p>
              <p> She could hear the sound of her son's voice coming toward them, 
                and, glancing swiftly round the terrace, she got up impulsively. 
                Her eyes glowed with the fire he knew so well; with a rapid movement 
                she raised her lovely hands, covered with rings, took his head, 
                looked into his face with a protracted gaze, and, putting up her 
                face with smiling, parted lips, swiftly kissed his mouth and both 
                eyes, and thrust him away. She would have gone, but he held her 
                back. </p>
              <p> `When?' he murmured in a whisper, gazing in ecstasy at her. 
              </p>
              <p> `Tonight, at one o'clock,' she whispered, and, with a heavy 
                sigh, she walked with her light, swift step to meet her son. </p>
              <p> Seriozha had been caught by the rain in the big garden, and 
                he and his nurse had taken shelter in a bower. </p>
              <p> `Well, au revoir,' she said to Vronsky. `I must soon be getting 
                ready for the races. Betsy promised to fetch me.' </p>
              <p> Vronsky, looking at his watch, hurriedly drove off. </p>

              <p><br>
                `Now, it's all over - God be praised!' was the first thought that 
                came to Anna Arkadyevna, when she had said good-by for the last 
                time to her brother, who had stood blocking up the entrance to 
                the carriage till the third bell rang. She sat down on her lounge 
                beside Annushka, and looked about her in the twilight of the sleeping 
                carriage. `Thank God! tomorrow I shall see Seriozha and Alexei 
                Alexandrovich, and my life, good and familiar, will go on in the 
                old way.' </p>
              <p>Still in the same anxious frame of mind in which she had been 
                all that day, Anna took a meticulous pleasure in making herself 
                comfortable for the journey. With her tiny, deft hands she opened 
                and shut her little red bag, took out a cushion, laid it on her 
                knees, and, carefully wrapping up her feet, settled herself comfortably. 
                An invalid lady had already lain down to sleep. Two other ladies 
                began talking to Anna, and a stout elderly lady tucked up her 
                feet, and made observations about the heating of the train. Anna 
                answered the ladies in a few words, but not foreseeing any entertainment 
                from the conversation, she asked Annushka to get a small lantern, 
                hooked it on the arm of her seat, and took from her bag a paper 
                knife and an English novel. At first she could not get interested 
                in her reading. The fuss and stir were disturbing; then, when 
                the train had started, she could not help listening to the noises; 
                then the snow beating on the left window and sticking to the pane, 
                and the sight of the muffled guard passing by, covered with snow 
                on one side, and the conversations about the terrible blizzard 
                raging outside, distracted her attention. And after that everything 
                was the same and the same: the same jouncing and rattling, the 
                same snow lashing the window, the same rapid transitions from 
                steaming heat to cold, and back again to heat, the same flitting 
                of the same faces in the half-murk, and the same voices; and then 
                Anna began to read, and to grasp what she read. Annushka was already 
                dozing, the red bag on her lap, clutched by her broad hands, in 
                gloves, of which one was torn. Anna Arkadyevna read and grasped 
                the sense, yet it was annoying to her to read - that is, to follow 
                the reflection of other people's lives. She had too great a desire 
                to live herself. If she read that the heroine of the novel were 
                nursing a sick man, she longed to move with noiseless steps about 
                his sickroom; if she read of a member of Parliament delivering 
                a speech, she longed to deliver it; if she read of how Lady Mary 
                had ridden after the hounds, and had provoked her sister-in-law, 
                and had surprised everyone by her daring - she, too, longed to 
                be doing the same. But there was no chance of doing anything; 
                and, her little hands toying with the smooth paper knife, she 
                forced herself to read. </p>
              <p> The hero of the novel was already beginning to attain his English 
                happiness, a baronetcy, and an estate, and Anna was feeling a 
                desire to go with him to his estate, when she suddenly felt that 
                he ought to feel ashamed, and that she was ashamed of the same 
                thing. But what was it he was ashamed of? `What have I to be ashamed 
                of?' she asked herself in injured surprise. She abandoned the 
                book and sank against the back of her chair, tightly gripping 
                the paper knife in both hands. There was nothing to be ashamed 
                of. She went over all her Moscow recollections. All were fine, 
                pleasant. She recalled the ball, recalled Vronsky and his enamored, 
                submissive face; she recalled all her conduct with him - there 
                was nothing shameful. Yet, with all that, at this very point in 
                her reminiscences, the feeling of shame was intensified, as though 
                some inner voice, precisely here, when she recalled Vronsky, were 
                saying to her: `Warm, very warm - hot!' `Well, what is it?' she 
                said to herself resolutely, shifting on her seat. `What does it 
                mean? Am I afraid to look at this without blinking? Well, what 
                is it? Can it be that between me and this boy-officer there exist, 
                or can exist, any other relations than such as are common with 
                every acquaintance?' She laughed contemptuously and took up her 
                book again; but now she was absolutely unable to make sense of 
                what she read. She passed the paper knife over the windowpane, 
                then laid its smooth, cool surface to her cheek, and almost laughed 
                aloud at the unreasoning joy that all at once possessed her. She 
                felt that her nerves, like strings, were being tautened more and 
                more upon some kind of tightening peg. She felt her eyes opening 
                wider and wider, her fingers and toes twitching nervously, something 
                within stopping her breathing, while all images and sounds seemed 
                in the swaying half-murk to strike her with extraordinary vividness. 
                Moments of doubt were continually besetting her: was the car going 
                forward, or back, or was it standing absolutely still? Was it 
                really Annushka at her side, or a stranger? `What's that on the 
                arm of the chair - a fur cloak or some beast? And what am I myself: 
                is it I, or some other woman?' She was afraid of yielding to this 
                trance - but something was drawing her into it, and, at will, 
                she could yield to it or resist it. She got up to rouse herself, 
                and slipped off her plaid and the cape of warm dress. For a moment 
                she regained her self-possession, and realized that the thin peasant 
                who had come in wearing a long nankeen overcoat, with a button 
                missing from it, was the fireman, that he was looking at the thermometer, 
                that the wind and snow had burst in after him through the door; 
                but then everything grew confused again.... That peasant with 
                the long waist took to gnawing something within the wall; the 
                little crone started stretching her legs the whole length of the 
                car and filled it with a black cloud; then there was a dreadful 
                screeching and banging, as though someone were being rent into 
                pieces; then a red blaze blinded her eyes, and, at last, everything 
                was screened by a wall. Anna felt that she had plunged downward. 
                Yet all this was not terrible, but joyful. The voice of a man 
                muffled up and covered with snow shouted something in her very 
                ear. She arose and came to, realizing that they had come to a 
                station, and that this was the conductor. She requested Annushka 
                to hand her the cape she had taken off, and her shawl, put them 
                on, and went toward the door. </p>
              <p> `Do you wish to get out?' asked Annushka. </p>
              <p> `Yes, I want to get a breath of air. It's very hot in here.' 
              </p>
              <p> And she opened the door. The blizzard and the wind rushed to 
                meet her and began to contend with her for the door. And even 
                this seemed joyful to her. She opened the door and stepped out. 
                This seemed to be all that the wind had been lying in wait for; 
                it set up a gleeful whistle and was about to snatch her up and 
                whirl her away, but she clutched the cold doorpost and, holding 
                on to her shawl, descended to the platform and the shelter of 
                the car. The wind had been mighty on the steps, but on the platform, 
                in the lee of the train, there was a lull. With enjoyment she 
                drew deep breaths of the snowy, frosty air and, standing near 
                the car, looked about the platform and the lighted station. </p>

              <p><br>
                The whole of that day Anna spent at home - that is, at the Oblonsky's, 
                and received no one, though some of her acquaintances had already 
                heard of her arrival, and came to call the same day. Anna spent 
                the whole morning with Dolly and the children. She merely sent 
                a brief note to her brother to tell him that he must not fail 
                to dine at home. `Come, God is merciful,' she wrote. <br>
                Oblonsky did dine at home: the conversation was general, and his 
                wife, speaking to him, addressed him as `Stiva,' as she had not 
                done for some time past. In the relations of husband and wife 
                the same estrangement still remained, but there was no talk of 
                separation, and Stepan Arkadyevich saw the possibility of explanation 
                and reconciliation. </p>
              <p> Immediately after dinner Kitty came in. She knew Anna Arkadyevna, 
                but only very slightly, and she came now to her sister's with 
                some trepidation, at the prospect of meeting this fashionable 
                Peterburg lady, of whom everyone spoke so highly. But she made 
                a favorable impression on Anna Arkadyevna - she perceived that 
                at once. Anna was unmistakably admiring her loveliness and her 
                youth: before Kitty knew where she was she found herself not merely 
                under Anna's sway, but in love with her, as young girls do fall 
                in love with older and married women. Anna did not resemble a 
                fashionable lady, or the mother of a boy eight years old. In the 
                elasticity of her movements, the freshness and the animation which 
                persisted in her face and broke out in her smile and her glance, 
                she would rather have passed for a girl of twenty, had it not 
                been for a serious and, at times, a mournful look in her eyes, 
                which struck and attracted Kitty. Kitty felt that Anna was perfectly 
                simple and was concealing nothing, but that she had another higher 
                world of interests, complex and poetic, which were inaccessible 
                to Kitty. </p>
              <p> After dinner, when Dolly withdrew to her own room, Anna rose 
                quickly and went up to her brother, who was just lighting a cigar. 
              </p>
              <p> `Stiva,' she said to him, winking gaily, making the sign of 
                the cross over him, and glancing toward the door, `go, and God 
                help you. </p>
              <p> He tossed away his cigar, having understood her, and departed 
                through the doorway. </p>
              <p> When Stepan Arkadyevich had disappeared, she went back to the 
                sofa where she had been sitting, surrounded by the children. Either 
                because the children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt, 
                or that they themselves sensed a special charm in her, the two 
                elder ones, and the younger following their lead, as children 
                so often do, had clung about their new aunt since before dinner, 
                and would not leave her side. And it had become a sort of game 
                among them to sit as close as possible to their aunt, to touch 
                her, hold her little hand, kiss it, play with her ring, or even 
                touch the flounce of her skirt. </p>
              <p> `Come, come, as we were sitting before,' said Anna Arkadyevna, 
                sitting down in her place. </p>
              <p> And again Grisha poked his little face under her arm, and nestled 
                with his head on her gown, beaming with pride and happiness. </p>
              <p> `And when is your next ball?' she asked Kitty. </p>
              <p> `Next week - and a splendid ball. One of those balls where one 
                always enjoys oneself.' </p>
              <p> `Why, are there balls where one always enjoys oneself?' Anna 
                said, with tender irony. </p>
              <p> `It's strange, but there are. At the Bobrishchev's one always 
                enjoys oneself, and at the Nikitin's too, while at the Mezhkov's 
                it's always dull. Haven't you noticed it?' </p>
              <p> `No, my dear, for me there are no balls now where one enjoys 
                oneself,' said Anna, and Kitty detected in her eyes that peculiar 
                world which was not revealed to her. `For me there are some which 
                are less dull and tiresome than others.' </p>
              <p> `How can you be dull at a ball?' </p>
              <p> `Why should not I be dull at a ball?' inquired Anna. </p>
              <p> Kitty perceived that Anna knew what answer would follow. </p>
              <p> `Because you always look the loveliest of all.' </p>
              <p> Anna had the faculty of blushing. She blushed, and said: </p>
              <p> `In the first place it's never so; and secondly, if it were, 
                what difference would it make to me?' </p>
              <p> `Are you coming to this ball? asked Kitty. </p>
              <p> `I imagine it won't be possible to avoid going. Here, take it,' 
                she said to Tania, who was pulling the loosely fitting ring off 
                her white, slender-tipped finger. </p>
              <p> `I shall be so glad if you go. I should so like to see you at 
                a ball.' </p>
              <p> `Anyway, if I do go, I shall comfort myself with the thought 
                that it's a pleasure to you.... Grisha, don't pull my hair. It's 
                untidy enough without that,' she said, putting up a straying lock, 
                which Grisha had been playing with. </p>
              <p> `I imagine you at the ball in lilac.' </p>
              <p> `And why in lilac, precisely?' asked Anna, smiling. `Now, children, 
                run along, run along. Do you hear? Miss Hoole is calling you to 
                tea,' she said tearing the children from her, and sending them 
                off to the dining room. </p>
              <p> `I know why you press me to come to the ball. You expect a great 
                deal of this ball, and you want everyone to be there and take 
                part in it.' </p>
              <p> `How do you know? Yes!' </p>
              <p> `Oh! What a happy time you are at,' pursued Anna. `I remember, 
                and I know this blue haze, like the mist on the mountains in Switzerland. 
                This mist, which covers everything in that blissful time when 
                childhood is just ending, and out of that vast circle, happy and 
                gay, there is a path growing narrower and narrower, and it is 
                delightful and alarming to enter the ballroom, bright and splendid 
                as it is.... Who has not been through it?' </p>
              <p> Kitty smiled without speaking. `But how did she go through it? 
                How I should like to know all her love story!' thought Kitty, 
                recalling the unromantic appearance of Alexei Alexandrovich, her 
                husband. </p>
              <p> `I know something. Stiva told me, and I congratulate you. I 
                liked him so much,' Anna continued. `I met Vronsky at the railway 
                station.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, was he there?' asked Kitty, blushing. `What was it Stiva 
                told you?' </p>
              <p> `Stiva blabbed about it all. And I should be so glad. I traveled 
                yesterday with Vronsky's mother,' she went on; `and his mother 
                talked without a pause of him; he's her favorite. I know mothers 
                are partial, but...' </p>
              <p> `What did his mother tell you?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, a great deal! And although I know that he's her favorite, 
                one can still see how chivalrous he is.... Well, for instance, 
                she told me that he had wanted to give up all his property to 
                his brother; that he had done something extraordinary when he 
                was quite a child - saved a woman from the water. He's a hero, 
                in fact,' said Anna, smiling and recollecting the two hundred 
                roubles he had given at the station. </p>
              <p> But she did not tell Kitty about the two hundred roubles. For 
                some reason it was disagreeable to her to think of it. She felt 
                that there was something that had to do with her in it, and something 
                that ought not to have been. </p>
              <p> `She pressed me very much to go and see her,' Anna went on; 
                `and I shall be glad to go to see her tomorrow. Stiva is staying 
                a long while in Dolly's room, thank God,' Anna added, changing 
                the subject, and getting up, Kitty fancied, displeased with something. 
              </p>
              <p> `No, I'm first! No, I!' screamed the children, who had finished 
                tea, running up to their Aunt Anna. </p>
              <p> `All together,' said Anna, and she ran laughing to meet them, 
                and, embracing them, threw all the children, shrieking with delight, 
                into a swarming heap. </p>

              <p><br>
                Levin had long before made the observation that when one is uncomfortable 
                with people from their being excessively amenable and meek, one 
                is apt very soon after to find things intolerable from their pretensions 
                and irritability. He felt that this was how it would be with his 
                brother. And his brother Nikolai's gentleness did not, in fact, 
                last out for long. The very next morning he began to be irritable, 
                and seemed doing his best to find fault with his brother, attacking 
                him on his tenderest points. </p>
              <p>Levin felt himself to blame, and could not set things right. 
                He felt that if they had both not kept up appearances, but had 
                spoken, as it is called, from the heart - that is to say, had 
                said only just what they were thinking and feeling - they would 
                simply have looked into each other's faces, and Konstantin could 
                only have said: `You're dying, you're dying,' and Nikolai could 
                only have answered: `I know I'm dying, but I'm afraid, I'm afraid, 
                I'm afraid!' And they could have said nothing more, if they had 
                said only what was in their hearts. But life like that was impossible, 
                and so Konstantin tried to do what he had been trying to do all 
                his life, and never could learn to do, though, as far as he could 
                observe, many people knew so well how to do it, and without it 
                there was no living at all. He tried to say what he was not thinking, 
                but he felt continually that it had a ring of falsehood, that 
                his brother detected him in it, and was exasperated at it. </p>
              <p> The third day Nikolai induced his brother to explain his plan 
                to him again, and began not merely attacking it, but intentionally 
                confounding it with communism. </p>
              <p> `You've simply borrowed an idea that's not your own, but you've 
                distorted it, and are trying to apply it where it's not applicable.' 
              </p>
              <p> `But I tell you there's nothing in common. They deny the justice 
                of property, of capital, of inheritance, while I do not deny this 
                chief stimulus.' (Levin felt disgusted himself at using such expressions, 
                but ever since he had been engrossed by his work, he had unconsciously 
                come more and more frequently to use non-Russian words.) `All 
                I want is to regulate labor.' </p>
              <p> `Which means, you've borrowed an idea, stripped it of all that 
                gave it its force, and want to make believe that it's something 
                new,' said Nikolai, angrily tugging at his necktie. </p>
              <p> `But my idea has nothing in common...' </p>
              <p> `The other, at any rate,' said Nikolai Levin, with an ironical 
                smile, his eyes flashing malignantly, `has the charm of - what's 
                one to call it? - geometrical symmetry, of clearness, of definiteness. 
                It may be a Utopia. If one once allows the possibility of making 
                all the past a tabula rasa - no property, no family - then labor 
                would organize itself. But you have nothing...' </p>
              <p> `Why do you mix things up? I've never been a communist.' </p>
              <p> `But I have, and I consider it's premature, but rational, and 
                it has a future, just like Christianity in its first ages.' </p>
              <p> `All that I maintain is that the labor force ought to be investigated 
                from the point of view of natural science; that is to say, it 
                ought to be studied, its qualities ascertained...' </p>
              <p> `But that's an utter waste of time. That force finds a certain 
                form of activity of itself, according to the stage of its development. 
                There have been slaves first, everywhere; then metayers; and we 
                have the metayage system, rent, and day laborers. What are you 
                trying to find?' </p>
              <p> Levin suddenly lost his temper at these words, because at the 
                bottom of his heart he was afraid that it was true - true that 
                he was trying to hold the balance even between communism and the 
                familiar forms, and that this was hardly possible. </p>
              <p> `I am trying to find means of working productively for myself 
                and for the laborers. I want to organize...' he answered hotly. 
              </p>
              <p> `You don't want to organize anything; it's simply the same as 
                you've been all your life - you want to be original, to pose as 
                not simply exploiting the peasants, but with some idea in view.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, all right, that's what you think - and let me alone!' answered 
                Levin, feeling the muscles of his left cheek twitching uncontrollably. 
              </p>
              <p> `You've never had, and never have, convictions; all you want 
                is to please your vanity.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, very well; let me alone then!' </p>
              <p> `And I will let you alone! And it's high time I did, and go 
                to the devil with you! And I'm very sorry I ever came!' </p>
              <p> In spite of all Levin's efforts to soothe his brother afterward, 
                Nikolai would listen to nothing he said, declaring that it was 
                better to part, and Konstantin saw that it was simply a case of 
                life being unbearable to him. </p>
              <p> Nikolai was just getting ready to go, when Konstantin went in 
                to him again and begged him, rather unnaturally, to forgive him 
                if he had hurt his feelings in any way. </p>
              <p> `Ah, generosity!' said Nikolai, and he smiled. `If you want 
                to be right, I can give you that satisfaction. You're in the right; 
                but I'm going all the same.' </p>
              <p> It was only just at parting that Nikolai kissed him, and said, 
                looking with sudden strangeness and seriousness at his brother: 
              </p>
              <p> `Anyway, don't remember evil against me, Kostia!' and his voice 
                quavered. </p>
              <p> These were the only words that had been spoken sincerely between 
                them. Levin knew that those words meant, `You see, and you know, 
                that I'm in a bad way, and maybe we shall never see each other 
                again.' Levin knew this, and the tears gushed from his eyes. He 
                kissed his brother once more, but he could not speak, and knew 
                not what to say. </p>
              <p> Two days after his brother's departure, Levin too set off for 
                his foreign tour. Happening to meet Shcherbatsky, Kitty's cousin, 
                in the railway train, Levin greatly astonished him by his depression. 
              </p>
              <p> `What's the matter with you?' Shcherbatsky asked him. </p>
              <p> `Oh, nothing; there's not much happiness in life.' </p>
              <p> `Not much? You come with me to Paris instead of to Mulhouse. 
                You shall see how to be happy.' </p>
              <p> `No, I've done with it all. It's time I was dead.' </p>
              <p> `Well, that's a good one!' said Shcherbatsky, laughing, `why, 
                I'm only just getting ready to begin.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, I thought the same not long ago, but now I know I shall 
                soon be dead.' </p>
              <p> Levin said what he had genuinely been thinking of late. He saw 
                nothing but death, or an approach to death in everything. But 
                his cherished scheme only engrossed him the more. Life had to 
                be got through somehow, till death did come. Darkness had fallen 
                upon everything for him; but just because of this darkness he 
                felt that the one guiding clue in the darkness was his work, and 
                he clutched it, and clung to it with all his strength. </p>

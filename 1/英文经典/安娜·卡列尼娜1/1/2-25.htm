              <p><br>
                There were seventeen officers in all riding in this race. The 
                racecourse was a large four-versta ring in the form of an ellipse 
                in front of the pavilion. On this course nine obstacles had been 
                arranged: the stream, a big and solid barrier two arsheenes high, 
                just before the pavilion, a dry ditch, a ditch full of water, 
                a precipitous slope, an Irish barricade (one of the most difficult 
                obstacles, consisting of a mound fenced with brushwood, beyond 
                which was a ditch out of sight for the horses, so that the horse 
                had to clear both obstacles or possibly be killed); then two more 
                ditches filled with water, and one dry one; and the end of the 
                race was just facing the pavilion. But the race began not in the 
                ring, but a hundred arsheenes away from it, and in that part of 
                the course was the first obstacle, a dammed-up stream, three arsheenes 
                in breadth, which the racers could leap or wade through as they 
                preferred. </p>
              <p>Three times they were ranged ready to start, but each time some 
                horse thrust itself out of line, and they had to begin again. 
                The starter, Colonel Sestrin, was beginning to lose his temper, 
                when at last, for the fourth time, he shouted `Away!' and the 
                riders started. </p>
              <p> Every eye, every opera glass, was turned on the brightly colored 
                group of riders at the moment they were in line to start. </p>
              <p> `They're off! They're starting!' was heard on all sides after 
                the hush of expectation. </p>
              <p> And little groups and solitary figures among the public began 
                running from place to place to get a better view. In the very 
                first minute the close group of horsemen spread out, and it could 
                be seen that they were approaching the stream in twos and threes 
                and one behind another. To the spectators it seemed as though 
                they had all started simultaneously, but to the racers there were 
                seconds of difference that had great value to them. </p>
              <p> Frou-Frou, excited and overnervous, had lost the first moment, 
                and several horses had started before her, but before reaching 
                the stream, Vronsky, who was holding in the mare with all his 
                force as she tugged at the bridle, easily overtook three, and 
                there were left in front of him Makhotin's chestnut Gladiator, 
                whose hindquarters were moving lightly and rhythmically up and 
                down exactly in front of Vronsky, and, in front of all, the dainty 
                mare Diana bearing the more dead than alive Kuzovlev. </p>
              <p> For the first instant Vronsky was not master either of himself 
                or his mare. Up to the first obstacle, the stream, he could not 
                guide the motions of his mare. </p>
              <p> Gladiator and Diana came up to it together and almost at the 
                same instant; at a stroke they rose above the stream and flew 
                across to the other side; Frou-Frou darted after them easily, 
                as if flying; but at the very moment when Vronsky felt himself 
                in the air, he suddenly saw almost under his mare's hoofs Kuzovlev, 
                who was floundering with Diana on the further side of the stream. 
                (Kuzovlev had let go the reins as he took the leap, and the mare 
                had fallen together with him over her head.) Those details Vronsky 
                learned later; at the moment all he saw was that just under him, 
                where Frou-Frou must alight, Diana's legs or head might be in 
                the way. But Frou-Frou drew up her legs and back in the very act 
                of leaping, like a falling cat, and, clearing the other mare, 
                alighted beyond her. </p>
              <p> `Oh, you darling!' flashed through Vronsky's head. </p>
              <p> After crossing the stream Vronsky had complete control of his 
                mare, and began holding her in, intending to cross the great barrier 
                behind Makhotin, and to try to overtake him in the clear ground 
                of about two hundred sazhenes that followed it. </p>
              <p> The great barrier stood just in front of the Imperial Pavilion. 
                The Czar and the whole Court, and crowds of people, were all gazing 
                at them - at him, and at Makhotin, a length ahead of him, as they 
                drew near the `devil,' as the solid barrier was called. Vronsky 
                was aware of those eyes fastened upon him from all sides, but 
                he saw nothing except the ears and neck of his own mare, the ground 
                racing to meet him, and the back and white legs of Gladiator beating 
                time swiftly before him, and keeping always the same distance 
                ahead. Gladiator rose, with no sound of knocking against anything. 
                With a wave of his short tail he disappeared from Vronsky's sight. 
              </p>
              <p> `Bravo!' cried a voice. </p>
              <p> At the same instant, under Vronsky's eyes, right before him 
                flashed the palings of the barrier. Without the slightest change 
                in her action his mare flew over it; the palings vanished, and 
                he heard only a crash behind him. The mare, excited by Gladiator's 
                keeping ahead, had risen too soon before the barrier, and grazed 
                it with one of her hind hoofs. But her pace never changed, and 
                Vronsky, feeling a spatter of mud in his face, realized that he 
                was once more the same distance from Gladiator. Once more he perceived 
                in front of him the same back and short tail, and again the same 
                swiftly moving white legs that got no further away. </p>
              <p> At the very moment when Vronsky thought that now was the time 
                to overtake Makhotin, Frou-Frou herself, understanding his thoughts, 
                without any incitement on his part, gained considerably, and began 
                getting alongside of Makhotin on the most favorable side, close 
                to the inner rope. Makhotin would not let her pass that side. 
                Vronsky had hardly formed the thought that he could perhaps pass 
                on the outer side, when Frou-Frou shifted her pace and began overtaking 
                him on the other side. Frou-Frou's shoulder, beginning by now 
                to be dark with sweat, was even with Gladiator's back. For a few 
                bounds they moved evenly. But before the obstacle they were approaching, 
                Vronsky began working at the reins, anxious to avoid having to 
                take the outer circle, and swiftly passed Makhotin just upon the 
                declivity. He caught a glimpse of his mud-stained face as he flashed 
                by. He even fancied that he smiled. Vronsky passed Makhotin, but 
                he was immediately aware of him close upon him, and he never ceased 
                hearing just behind him the even-thudding hoofs and the rapid 
                and still quite fresh breathing of Gladiator. </p>
              <p> The next two obstacles, the watercourse and the barrier, were 
                easily crossed, but Vronsky began to hear the snorting and thud 
                of Gladiator closer upon him. He urged on his mare, and to his 
                delight felt that she easily quickened her pace, and the thud 
                of Gladiator's hoofs was again heard at the same distance away. 
              </p>
              <p> Vronsky was at the head of the race, just as he wanted to be 
                and as Cord had advised, and now he felt sure of being the winner. 
                His excitement, his delight, and his tenderness for Frou-Frou 
                grew keener and keener. He longed to look round, but he did not 
                dare do this, and tried to be cool and not to urge on his mare, 
                so as to keep the same reserve of force in her as he felt that 
                Gladiator still kept. There remained only one obstacle, the most 
                difficult; if he could cross it ahead of the others, he would 
                come in first. He was flying toward the Irish barricade; Frou-Frou 
                and he both together saw the barricade in the distance, and both 
                the man and the mare had a moment's hesitation. He saw the uncertainty 
                in the mare's ears and lifted the whip, but at the same time felt 
                that his fears were groundless; the mare knew what was wanted. 
                She quickened her pace and rose rhythmically, just as he had fancied 
                she would, and as she left the ground gave herself up to the force 
                of her rush, which carried her far beyond the ditch; and with 
                the same rhythm, without effort, with the same leg forward, Frou-Frou 
                fell back into her pace again. </p>
              <p> `Bravo, Vronsky!' he heard shouts from a knot of men - he knew 
                they were his friends and his regiment comrades - who were standing 
                at the obstacle. He could not fail to recognize Iashvin's voice, 
                though he did not see him. </p>
              <p> `O my sweet!' he said inwardly to Frou-Frou, as he listened 
                for what was happening behind. `He's cleared it!' he thought, 
                catching the thud of Gladiator's hoofs behind him. There remained 
                only the last ditch, filled with water and two arsheenes wide. 
                Vronsky did not even look at it, but anxious to come in a long 
                way ahead began sawing away at the reins, lifting the mare's head 
                and letting it go in time with her paces. He felt that the mare 
                was at her very last reserve of strength; not her neck and shoulders 
                merely were wet, but the sweat was standing in drops on her mane, 
                her head, her sharp ears, and her breath came in short, sharp 
                gasps. But he knew that she had strength left more than enough 
                for the remaining two hundred sazhenes. It was only from feeling 
                himself nearer the ground and from the peculiar smoothness of 
                his motion that Vronsky knew how greatly the mare had quickened 
                her pace. She flew over the ditch as though not noticing it. She 
                flew over it like a bird; but at the same instant Vronsky, to 
                his horror, felt that failing to keep up with the mare's pace, 
                he had, he did not know how, made an abominable, unpardonable 
                move in recovering his seat in the saddle. All at once his position 
                had shifted and he knew that something awful had happened. He 
                could not yet make out what had happened, when the white legs 
                of a chestnut horse flashed by close to him, and Makhotin passed 
                at a swift gallop. Vronsky was touching the ground with one foot, 
                and his mare was sinking on that foot. He just had time to free 
                his leg when she fell on one side, gasping painfully, and, making 
                vain efforts to rise with her delicate, soaking neck, she fluttered 
                on the ground at his feet like a shot bird. The clumsy movement 
                made by Vronsky had broken her back. But that he only knew much 
                later. At that moment he knew only that Makhotin had flown swiftly 
                by, while he stood staggering alone on the muddy, motionless ground, 
                and Frou-Frou lay gasping before him, bending her head back and 
                gazing at him with her exquisite eye. Still unable to realize 
                what had happened, Vronsky tugged at his mare's reins. Again she 
                struggled all over like a fish, and, her shoulders making the 
                wings of the saddle crackle, she rose on her front legs; but unable 
                to lift her back, she quivered all over and again fell on her 
                side. With his face hideous with passion, pale, his lower jaw 
                trembling, Vronsky kicked her with his heel in the stomach and 
                again fell to tugging at the rein. She did not stir, but thrusting 
                her nose into the ground, she simply gazed at her master with 
                her speaking eyes. </p>
              <p> `A-a-a!' groaned Vronsky, clutching at his head. `Ah! what have 
                I done!' he cried. `The race lost! And my fault! shameful, unpardonable! 
                And the poor darling, ruined mare! Ah, what have I done!' </p>
              <p> A crowd of men, a doctor and his assistant, the officers of 
                his regiment, ran up to him. To his misery he felt that he was 
                whole and unhurt. The mare had broken her back, and it was decided 
                to shoot her. Vronsky could not answer questions, could not speak 
                to anyone. He turned, and without picking up his fallen cap, walked 
                away from the racecourse, unconscious of where he was going. He 
                felt utterly wretched. For the first time in his life he knew 
                the bitterest sort of misfortune, misfortune beyond remedy, and 
                caused by his own fault. </p>
              <p> Iashvin overtook him with his cap, and led him home, and half 
                an hour later Vronsky had regained his self-possession. But the 
                memory of that race remained for long in his heart, the cruelest 
                and bitterest memory of his life. </p>

                The place fixed on for the stand shooting was not far above a 
                stream in a little aspen copse. On reaching the copse, Levin got 
                out of the droshky and led Oblonsky to a corner of a mossy, swampy 
                glade, already quite free from snow. He went back himself to a 
                double birch tree on the other side, and, leaning his gun on the 
                fork of a dead lower branch, he took off his full overcoat, fastened 
                his belt again, and worked his arms to see if they were free. 
              </p>
              <p>Gray old Laska, who had followed them, sat down warily opposite 
                him and pricked up her ears. The sun was setting behind a thick 
                forest, and in the glow of sunset the birch trees, dotted about 
                in the aspen copse, stood out clearly with their hanging twigs, 
                and their buds swollen almost to bursting. </p>
              <p> From the thickest parts of the copse, where the snow still remained, 
                came the faint sound of narrow winding streamlets of water running 
                away. Tiny birds twittered, and now and then fluttered from tree 
                to tree. </p>
              <p> In the pauses of complete stillness there came the rustle of 
                last year's leaves, stirred by the thawing of the earth and the 
                growth of grasses. </p>
              <p> `Imagine! One can hear and see the grass growing!' Levin said 
                to himself, noticing a wet, slate-colored aspen leaf moving beside 
                a blade of young grass. He stood, listened, and gazed sometimes 
                down at the wet mossy ground, sometimes at Laska listening all 
                alert, sometimes at the sea of bare treetops that stretched on 
                the slope below him, sometimes at the darkening sky, covered with 
                white streaks of cloud. A hawk flew high over a forest far away 
                with a slow sweep of its wings; another flew with exactly the 
                same motion in the same direction and vanished. The birds twittered 
                more and more loudly and busily in the thicket. An owl hooted 
                not far off, and Laska, starting, stepped cautiously a few steps 
                forward, and, putting her head on one side, began to listen intently. 
                Beyond the stream was heard the cuckoo. Twice she uttered her 
                usual call, and then became hoarse, hurried, and broke down. </p>
              <p> `Imagine! The cuckoo already!' said Stepan Arkadyevich, coming 
                out from behind a bush. </p>
              <p> `Yes, I hear it,' answered Levin, reluctantly breaking the stillness 
                with his voice, which sounded disagreeable to himself. `Now it's 
                coming!' </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich's figure again went behind the bush, and 
                Levin saw nothing but the bright flash of a match, followed by 
                the red glow and blue smoke of a cigarette. </p>
              <p> Tchk! Tchk! came the snapping sound of Stepan Arkadyevich cocking 
                his gun. </p>
              <p> `What's that cry?' asked Oblonsky, drawing Levin's attention 
                to a prolonged cry, as though a colt were whinnying in a high 
                voice, in play. </p>
              <p> `Oh, don't you know it? That's a buck hare. But enough talking! 
                Listen - here it comes!' almost shrieked Levin, cocking his gun. 
              </p>
              <p> They heard a shrill whistle in the distance, and in the exact 
                time, so well known to the sportsman, two seconds later - another, 
                a third, and, after the third whistle, the hoarse, guttural cry 
                could be heard. </p>
              <p> Levin looked about him to right and to left, and there, just 
                facing him against the dusky blue sky above the confused mass 
                of tender shoots of the aspens, he saw the flying bird. It was 
                flying straight toward him; the guttural cry, like the even tearing 
                of some strong stuff, sounded close to his ear; the long beak 
                and neck of the bird could be seen, and at the very instant when 
                Levin was taking aim, behind the bush where Oblonsky stood, there 
                was a flash of red lightning: the bird dropped like an arrow, 
                and darted upward again. Again came the red flash and the sound 
                of a blow, and, fluttering its wings as though trying to keep 
                up in the air, the bird paused, stopped still an instant, and 
                fell with a heavy splash to the slushy ground. </p>
              <p> `Can I possibly have missed it?' shouted Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                who could not see for the smoke. </p>
              <p> `Here it is!' said Levin, pointing to Laska, who, with one ear 
                pricked up, wagging the tip of her shaggy tail, was coming slowly 
                back, as though she would prolong the pleasure, and seemingly 
                smiling, was bringing the dead bird to her master. `Well, I'm 
                glad you were successful,' said Levin, who, at the same time, 
                had a sense of envy that he had not succeeded in shooting the 
                woodcock. </p>
              <p> `It was a bad shot from the right barrel,' responded Stepan 
                Arkadyevich, loading his gun. `Sh... Here it comes!' </p>
              <p> The shrill whistles rapidly following one another were heard 
                again. Two woodcocks, playing and chasing one another, and only 
                whistling, not crying, flew straight at the very heads of the 
                sportsmen. There was the report of four shots, and like swallows, 
                the woodcocks turned swift somersaults in the air and vanished 
                from sight. </p>
              <p> The stand shooting was capital. Stepan Arkadyevich shot two 
                more birds, and Levin two, of which one was not found. It began 
                to get dark. Venus, bright and silvery, shone with her soft light 
                low down in the west, behind the birch trees, and high up in the 
                east twinkled the red fires of somber Arcturus. Over his head 
                Levin made out the stars of the Great Bear and lost them again. 
                The woodcocks had ceased flying; but Levin resolved to stay a 
                little longer, till Venus, which he saw below a branch of birch, 
                should be above it, and the stars of the Great Bear should be 
                perfectly plain. Venus had risen above the branch, and the chariot 
                of the Great Bear with its shaft was now all plainly visible against 
                the dark blue sky, yet still he waited. </p>
              <p> `Isn't it time to go home?' said Stepan Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> It was quite still now in the copse, and not a bird was stirring. 
              </p>
              <p> `Let's stay a little while,' answered Levin. </p>
              <p> `As you like.' </p>
              <p> They were standing now about fifteen paces from one another. 
              </p>
              <p> `Stiva!' said Levin unexpectedly; `how is it you don't tell 
                me whether your sister-in-law's married yet, or when she's going 
                to be?' </p>
              <p> Levin felt so resolute and serene that no answer he fancied 
                could affect him. But he had never dreamed of the answer which 
                Stepan Arkadyevich made. </p>
              <p> `She's never thought of being married, and isn't thinking of 
                it; but she's very ill, and the doctors have sent her abroad. 
                They're positively afraid she may not live.' </p>
              <p> `What!' cried Levin. `Very ill? What is wrong with her? How 
                is she?...' </p>
              <p> While they were speaking, Laska, with ears pricked up, was looking 
                upward at the sky, and, reproachfully, at them. </p>
              <p> `What a time they have chosen to gab,' she was thinking. `There 
                it comes.... Here it is - yes, sure enough. They'll miss it...' 
                thought Laska. </p>
              <p> But at that very instant both suddenly heard a shrill whistle 
                which, as it were, smote on their ears, and both suddenly seized 
                their guns and two flashes gleamed, and two bangs sounded at the 
                very same instant. The woodcock flying high above instantly folded 
                its wings and fell into a thicket, bending down the delicate shoots. 
              </p>
              <p> `Splendid! Together!' cried Levin, and he ran with Laska into 
                the thicket to look for the woodcock. </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes, what was it that was unpleasant?' he recollected. 
                `Yes, Kitty's ill... Well, it can't be helped; I'm very sorry,' 
                he thought. </p>
              <p> `She's found it! Isn't she a clever girl?' he said, taking the 
                warm bird from Laska's mouth and packing it into the almost full 
                gamebag. `I've got it, Stiva!' he shouted. </p>
              <p></p>

              The place fixed on for the stand shooting was not far above a stream 
              in a little aspen copse. On reaching the copse, Levin got out of 
              the droshky and led Oblonsky to a corner of a mossy, swampy glade, 
              already quite free from snow. He went back himself to a double birch 
              tree on the other side, and, leaning his gun on the fork of a dead 
              lower branch, he took off his full overcoat, fastened his belt again,

              <p> `Isn't it time to go home?' said Stepan Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> It was quite still now in the copse, and not a bird was stirring. 
              </p>
              <p> `Let's stay a little while,' answered Levin. </p>
              <p> `As you like.' </p>
              <p> They were standing now about fifteen paces from one another. 
              </p>
              <p> `Stiva!' said Levin unexpectedly; `how is it you don't tell 
                me whether your sister-in-law's married yet, or when she's going 
                to be?' </p>
              <p> Levin felt so resolute and serene that no answer he fancied 
                could affect him. But he had never dreamed of the answer which 
                Stepan Arkadyevich made. </p>
              <p> `She's never thought of being married, and isn't thinking of 
                it; but she's very ill, and the doctors have sent her abroad. 
                They're positively afraid she may not live.' </p>
              <p> `What!' cried Levin. `Very ill? What is wrong with her? How 
                is she?...' </p>
              <p> While they were speaking, Laska, with ears pricked up, was looking 
                upward at the sky, and, reproachfully, at them. </p>
              <p> `What a time they have chosen to gab,' she was thinking. `There 
                it comes.... Here it is - yes, sure enough. They'll miss it...' 
                thought Laska. </p>
              <p> But at that very instant both suddenly heard a shrill whistle 
                which, as it were, smote on their ears, and both suddenly seized 
                their guns and two flashes gleamed, and two bangs sounded at the 
                very same instant. The woodcock flying high above instantly folded 
                its wings and fell into a thicket, bending down the delicate shoots. 
              </p>
              <p> `Splendid! Together!' cried Levin, and he ran with Laska into 
                the thicket to look for the woodcock. </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes, what was it that was unpleasant?' he recollected. 
                `Yes, Kitty's ill... Well, it can't be helped; I'm very sorry,' 
                he thought. </p>
              <p> `She's found it! Isn't she a clever girl?' he said, taking the 
                warm bird from Laska's mouth and packing it into the almost full 
                gamebag. `I've got it, Stiva!' he shouted. </p>

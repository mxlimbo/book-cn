              <p><br>
                When Kitty had gone and Levin was left alone, he felt such uneasiness 
                without her and such an impatient longing to get as quickly as 
                possible to tomorrow morning, when he would see her again and 
                be plighted to her forever, that he felt afraid, as though of 
                death, of those fourteen hours that he had to get through without 
                her. It was essential for him to be with someone to talk to, so 
                as not to be left alone; to deceive time. Stepan Arkadyevich would 
                have been the companion most congenial to him, but he was going 
                out, he said, to a soiree - in reality to the ballet. Levin only 
                had time to tell him he was happy, and that he loved him, and 
                would never, never forget what he had done for him. The eyes and 
                the smile of Stepan Arkadyevich showed Levin that he comprehended 
                that feeling fittingly. </p>
              <p>`Oh, so it's not time to die yet?' said Stepan Arkadyevich, pressing 
                Levin's hand with emotion. </p>
              <p> `N-n-no!' said Levin. </p>
              <p> Darya Alexandrovna too, as she said good-by to him, gave him 
                a sort of congratulation, saying, `How glad I am you have met 
                Kitty again! One must value old friends.' Levin did not like these 
                words of Darya Alexandrovna's. She could not understand how lofty 
                and beyond her it all was, and she ought not to have dared to 
                allude to it. Levin said good-by to them, but, not to be left 
                alone, he attached himself to his brother. </p>
              <p> `Where are you going?' </p>
              <p> `I'm going to a meeting.' </p>
              <p> `Well, I'll come with you. May I?' </p>
              <p> `What for? Yes, come along,' said Sergei Ivanovich, smiling. 
                `What is the matter with you today?' </p>
              <p> `With me? Happiness is the matter with me!' said Levin, letting 
                down the window of the carriage they were driving in. `You don't 
                mind? It's so stifling. Happiness is all that's the matter with 
                me! Why is it you have never married?' </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich smiled. </p>
              <p> `I am very glad - she seems a lovely gi...' Sergei Ivanovich 
                was beginning. </p>
              <p> `Don't say it! Don't say it!' shouted Levin, clutching at the 
                collar of his fur coat with both hands, and muffling him up in 
                it. `She's a lovely girl' were such simple, humble words, so out 
                of harmony with his feeling. </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich laughed outright a merry laugh, which was rare 
                with him. </p>
              <p> `Well, anyway, I may say that I'm very glad of it.' </p>
              <p> `That you may do tomorrow, tomorrow - and say no more! Nothing, 
                nothing - silence,' said Levin, and muffling him once more in 
                his fur coat, he added: `I do like you so! Well, is it possible 
                for me to be present at the meeting?' </p>
              <p> `Of course it is.' </p>
              <p> `What is your discussion about today?' asked Levin, never ceasing 
                smiling. </p>
              <p> They arrived at the meeting. Levin heard the secretary hesitatingly 
                read the minutes which he obviously did not himself understand; 
                but Levin saw from this secretary's face what a good, fine, kindhearted 
                person he was. This was evident from his confusion and embarrassment 
                in reading the minutes. Then the discussion began. They were disputing 
                about the reckoning off of certain sums and the laying of certain 
                pipes, and Sergei Ivanovich was very cutting to two members, and 
                said something at great length with an air of triumph; and another 
                member, scribbling something on a bit of paper, began timidly 
                at first, but afterward answered him very viciously and delightfully. 
                And then Sviiazhsky (he was there also) said something too, very 
                handsomely and nobly. Levin listened to them, and saw clearly 
                that this reckoning off of sums and these pipes were not anything 
                real, and that they were not at all angry, but were all the finest, 
                kindest people, and everything was as happy and charming as possible 
                among them. They did no harm to anyone, and were all enjoying 
                it. What struck Levin was that he could see through them all today, 
                and from little, almost imperceptible signs knew the soul of each, 
                and saw distinctly that they were all good at heart. And they 
                were all extremely fond of Levin in particular that day. This 
                was evident from the way they spoke to him, from the friendly, 
                affectionate way even those whom he did not know looked at him. 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, are you contented with it?' Sergei Ivanovich asked him. 
              </p>
              <p> `Very much. I never supposed it was so interesting, nice, capital!' 
              </p>
              <p> Sviiazhsky went up to Levin and invited him to come round to 
                tea with him. Levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall 
                what it was he had disliked in Sviiazhsky, what he had failed 
                to find in him. He was a clever and wonderfully goodhearted man. 
              </p>
              <p><br>
                `Most delighted,' he said, and asked after his wife and sister-in-law. 
                And from a queer association of ideas, because in his imagination 
                the idea of Sviiazhsky's sister-in-law was connected with marriage, 
                it occurred to him that there was no one to whom he could more 
                suitably speak of his happiness, than to Sviiazhsky's wife and 
                sister-in-law, and he was very glad to go to see them. </p>
              <p> Sviiazhsky questioned him about his improvements on his estate, 
                presupposing, as he always did, that there was no possibility 
                of doing anything not done already in Europe, and now this did 
                not in the least annoy Levin. On the contrary, he felt that Sviiazhsky 
                was right, that the whole business was of little value, and he 
                saw the wonderful suavity and consideration with which Sviiazhsky 
                avoided fully expressing his correct view. The ladies of the Sviiazhsky 
                household were particularly delightful. It seemed to Levin that 
                they knew all about it already, and sympathized with him, saying 
                nothing merely out of delicacy. He stayed with them one hour, 
                two, three, talking of all sorts of subjects, but implied in it 
                the only thing that filled his heart, and did not observe that 
                he was boring them dreadfully, and that it was long past their 
                bedtime. Sviiazhsky went with him into the hall, yawning and wondering 
                at the strange humor his friend was in. It was past one o'clock. 
                Levin went back to his hotel, and was dismayed at the thought 
                that all alone now with his impatience he had ten hours still 
                left to get through. The servant, whose turn it was to be up all 
                night, lighted his candles, and would have gone away, but Levin 
                stopped him. This servant, Iegor, whom Levin had not noticed before, 
                struck him as a very intelligent, excellent, and, above all, a 
                goodhearted man. </p>
              <p> `Well, Iegor, it's hard work not sleeping, isn't it?' </p>
              <p> `What's to be done! It's part of our work, you see. In a gentleman's 
                house it's easier; but then here one makes more.' </p>
              <p> It appeared that Iegor had a family - three boys and a daughter, 
                a seamstress, whom he wanted to marry to a cashier in a saddler's 
                shop. </p>
              <p> Levin, on hearing this, informed Iegor that, in his opinion, 
                in marriage the great thing was love, and that with love one would 
                always be happy, for happiness rests only on oneself. </p>
              <p> Iegor listened attentively, and obviously quite took in Levin's 
                idea, but by way of assent to it he enunciated, greatly to Levin's 
                surprise, the observation that when he had lived with good masters 
                he had always been satisfied with his masters, and now was perfectly 
                satisfied with his employer, though he was a Frenchman. </p>
              <p> `Wonderfully goodhearted fellow!' thought Levin. </p>
              <p> `Well, but you yourself, Iegor, when you got married, did you 
                love your wife?' </p>
              <p> `Ay! And why not?' responded Iegor. </p>
              <p> And Levin saw that Iegor too was in an excited state and intending 
                to express all his most heartfelt emotions. </p>
              <p> `My life, too, has been a wonderful one. From a child up...' 
                he was beginning with flashing eyes, apparently catching Levin's 
                enthusiasm, just as people catch yawning. </p>
              <p> But at that moment a ring was heard. Iegor departed, and Levin 
                was left alone. He had eaten scarcely anything at dinner, had 
                refused tea and supper at Sviiazhsky's, but he was incapable of 
                thinking of supper. He had not slept the previous night, but was 
                incapable of thinking of sleep either. His room was cold, but 
                he was oppressed by heat. He opened both the movable panes in 
                his windows and sat down on the table opposite the open panes. 
                Over the snow-covered roofs could be seen a decorated cross, with 
                chains, and above it the rising triangle of Auriga, with the yellowish 
                light of Capella. He gazed at the cross, then at the star, drank 
                in the fresh freezing air that flowed evenly into the room, and 
                followed as though in a dream the images and memories that rose 
                in his imagination. At four o'clock he heard steps in the passage 
                and peeped out of the door. It was the gambler Miaskin, whom he 
                knew, coming from the club. He walked gloomily, frowning and coughing. 
                `Poor, unlucky fellow!' thought Levin, and tears came into his 
                eyes from love and pity for this man. He would have talked with 
                him, and tried to comfort him, but remembering that he had nothing 
                but his shirt on, he changed his mind and sat down again at the 
                open pane to bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines 
                of the cross, silent, but full of meaning for him, and the mounting 
                lurid yellow star. At six o'clock there was a noise of people 
                polishing the floors, and church bells ringing to some divine 
                service, and Levin felt that he was beginning to get frozen. He 
                closed the pane, washed, dressed, and went out into the street.

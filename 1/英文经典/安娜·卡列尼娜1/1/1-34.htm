              <p><br>
                Upon his departure from Peterburg Vronsky had left his large apartments 
                on Morskaia to his friend and favorite comrade Petritsky. </p>
              <p>Petritsky was a young lieutenant, not particularly well-connected, 
                and not merely not wealthy, but in debt all around. Toward evening 
                he was always drunk, and he had often found himself in the guardhouse 
                because of sorts of ludicrous and disgraceful scrapes, but he 
                was a favorite both of his comrades and his superior officers. 
                At twelve o'clock, as Vronsky was driving up from the station 
                to his quarters, he saw, near the entrance of the house, a hired 
                carriage familiar to him. Even as he rang he heard, beyond the 
                door, masculine laughter, the twitter of a feminine voice, and 
                Petritsky's shout: `If that's one of the villains, don't let him 
                in!' Vronsky told the servant not to announce him, and slipped 
                noiselessly into the first room. Baroness Shilton, a friend of 
                Petritsky's, with a rosy little face and flaxen-fair, resplendent 
                in a lilac satin gown, and filling the whole room, like a canary, 
                with her Parisian accents, sat at a round table, brewing coffee. 
                Petritsky, in his overcoat, and the cavalry captain Kamerovsky, 
                in full uniform, probably just come from duty, were sitting near 
                her. </p>
              <p> `Bravo! Vronsky!' shouted Petritsky, jumping up, scraping his 
                chair. `Our host himself! Baroness, some coffee for him out of 
                the new coffeepot. There, we didn't expect you! I Hope you're 
                satisfied with the adornment of your study,' he said, indicating 
                the Baroness. `You know each other, of course?' </p>
              <p> `I should say so!' said Vronsky, with a bright smile, squeezing 
                the Barones'ss little hand. `Why, we're old friends.' </p>
              <p> `You've just returned after traveling,' said the Baroness, `so 
                I'll run along. Oh, I'll be off this minute, if I'm in the way!' 
              </p>
              <p> `You're home, wherever you are, Baroness,' said Vronsky. `How 
                do you do, Kamerovsky?' he added, coldly shaking hands with Kamerovsky. 
              </p>
              <p> `There, you can never say such charming things,' said the Baroness, 
                turning to Petritsky. </p>
              <p> `No - why not? After dinner even I can say things quite as good.' 
              </p>
              <p> `After dinner there's no merit in them! Well, then, I'll give 
                you some coffee; go wash and tidy up,' said the Baroness, sitting 
                down again, and anxiously turning a gadget in the new coffee urn. 
                `Pierre, give me the coffee,' she said, addressing Petritsky, 
                whom she called Pierre, playing on his surname, making no secret 
                of her relations with him. `I want to put some more in.' </p>
              <p> `You'll spoil it!' </p>
              <p> `No, I won't spoil it! Well, and how is your wife?' said the 
                Baroness suddenly, interrupting Vronsky's conversation with his 
                comrade. `We've been marrying you off here. Have you brought your 
                wife along?' </p>
              <p> `No, Baroness. I was born a gypsy, and a gypsy I'll die.' </p>
              <p> `So much the better - so much the better. Shake hands on it.' 
              </p>
              <p> And the Baroness, detaining Vronsky, began telling him, interspersing 
                her story with many jokes, about her latest plans of life, and 
                seeking his counsel. </p>
              <p> `He persists in refusing to give me a divorce! Well, what am 
                I to do?' (He was her husband.) `Now I want to begin a suit against 
                him. What would you advise? Kamerovsky, look after the coffee 
                - it's boiled out; you can see I'm taken up with business! I want 
                a lawsuit, because I must have my property. You can understand 
                the stupidity of his saying that I am unfaithful to him,' she 
                said contemptuously, `yet through it he wants to get the benefit 
                of my fortune.' </p>
              <p> Vronsky heard with pleasure this lighthearted prattle of a pretty 
                woman, said yes to everything, gave her half-joking counsel, and 
                altogether dropped at once into the tone habitual to him in talking 
                to such women. In his Peterburg world all people were divided 
                into two utterly opposed kinds. One, the lower, consisted of vulgar, 
                stupid and, above all, ridiculous people, who believe that one 
                husband ought to live with the one wife whom he has lawfully wedded; 
                that a girl should be innocent, a woman modest, and a man manly, 
                self-controlled, and strong; that one ought to bring up one's 
                children, earn one's bread and pay one's debts; and various similar 
                absurdities. Those people were of an old-fashioned and ridiculous 
                kind. But there was another kind of people - real people, to which 
                they all belonged, and here the chief thing was to be elegant, 
                magnanimous, daring, gay, and to abandon oneself without a blush 
                to every passion, and to laugh at everything else. </p>
              <p> For the first moment only, Vronsky was startled, after the impressions 
                of a quite different world that he had brought with him from Moscow; 
                but immediately, as though he had thrust his feet into old slippers, 
                he stepped into his former lighthearted, pleasant world. </p>
              <p> The coffee was really never made, but spluttered over everyone 
                and boiled away, doing just what was required of it - that is, 
                providing cause for much noise and laughter, and spoiling a costly 
                rug and the Barones'ss gown. </p>
              <p> `Well, good-by now - or else you'll never get washed, and I 
                shall have on my conscience the worst offense any decent person 
                can commit - uncleanliness. So you would advise a knife at his 
                throat?' </p>
              <p> `Absolutely - and in such a way that your little hand may not 
                be far from his lips. He'll kiss it, and all will end well,' answered 
                Vronsky. </p>
              <p> `So, the Fran?ais tonight!' and, with a rustle of her skirts, 
                she vanished. </p>
              <p> Kamerovsky got up too, and Vronsky, without waiting for him 
                to go, shook hands and went off to his dressing room. While he 
                was washing, Petritsky briefly outlined to him his position, as 
                far as it had changed since Vronsky's departure from Peterburg. 
                No money whatsoever. His father said he wouldn't give him any, 
                nor pay his debts. His tailor was trying to get him locked up, 
                and another fellow, too, was threatening to do so without fail. 
                The colonel of his regiment had announced that if these scandals 
                did not cease a resignation would be inevitable. As for the Baroness, 
                he was fed up with her, particularly because she was forever wanting 
                to give him money. But there was another girl - he intended showing 
                her to Vronsky - a marvel, exquisite, in the strict Oriental style, 
                `genre of the slave Rebecca, you see.' He had had a row, too, 
                with Berkoshev, and the latter intended sending seconds, but, 
                of course, it would all come to nothing. Altogether everything 
                was going splendidly and was most jolly. And, without letting 
                his comrade enter into further details of his position, Petritsky 
                proceeded to tell him all the interesting news. As he listened 
                to Petritsky's familiar stories, in the familiar setting of the 
                rooms he had spent the last three years in, Vronsky felt the delightful 
                sensation of coming back to the insouciant and customary life 
                of Peterburg. </p>
              <p> `Impossible!' he cried, releasing the pedal of the wash basin 
                in which he had been sousing his stalwart red neck. `Impossible!' 
                he cried, at the news that Laura had dropped Fertinghof and had 
                tied up with Mileev. `And is he as stupid and satisfied as ever? 
                Well, and what's Buzulukov doing?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, Buzulukov got into a scrape - simply lovely!' cried Petritsky. 
                `You know his passion for balls - and he never misses a single 
                one at court. He went to a big ball in a new casque. Have you 
                seen the new casques? Very good, and lighter. Well, he's standing... 
                No - do listen.' </p>
              <p> `I am listening,' answered Vronsky, rubbing himself with a rough 
                towel. </p>
              <p> `The Grand Duchess passes by with some ambassador or other, 
                and, as ill luck would have it, their talk veers to the new casques. 
                And so the Grand Duchess wanted to show the new casque to the 
                ambassador.... Just then they catch sight of our dear boy standing 
                there.' (Petritsky mimicked him, standing with his casque.) `The 
                Grand Duchess requested him to give her the casque - he doesn't 
                do so. What's up? Well, they all wink at him, and nod and frown 
                - give it to her, do! He still doesn't. Just stands there, stock-still. 
                You can picture it to yourself!... Well, this... what's his name... 
                tries to take the casque from him... He won't give it up!... This 
                chap tore it from him, and hands it to the Grand Duchess. `This 
                is the new casque,' says the Grand Duchess. She turned the casque 
                over, and - just picture it! - bang went a pear and candy out 
                of it - two pounds of candy!... He'd collected all that - our 
                dear boy!' </p>
              <p> Vronsky rolled with laughter. And, long afterward, even when 
                he was talking of other things, he would go off into peals of 
                his hearty laughter baring his strong, closely set teeth, whenever 
                he thought of the casque. </p>
              <p> Having learned all the news, Vronsky, with the assistance of 
                his valet, got into his uniform, and went off to report himself. 
                He intended, afterward, to go to his brother and to Betsy, and 
                to pay several visits, as an entering wedge into that society 
                where he might meet Madame Karenina. As always in Peterburg, he 
                left home without any intention of returning before very late 
                at night. </p>

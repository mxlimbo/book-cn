              <p><br>
                When the professor had gone, Sergei Ivanovich turned to his brother. 
                <br>
                `Delighted that you've come. For how long? How's your farming 
                getting on?' </p>
              <p> Levin knew that his elder brother took little interest in farming, 
                and only put the question in deference to him, and therefore he 
                told him only about the sale of his wheat and money matters. </p>
              <p> Levin had meant to tell his brother of his determination to 
                get married, and to ask his advice; he had indeed firmly resolved 
                to do so. But after seeing his brother, listening to his conversation 
                with the professor, hearing afterward the unconsciously patronizing 
                tone in which his brother questioned him about agricultural matters 
                (their mother's property had not been divided, and Levin took 
                charge of both their shares), Levin felt that he could not for 
                some reason broach to him his intention of marrying. He felt that 
                his brother would not look on it as he would have wished him. 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, how is your Zemstvo doing?' asked Sergei Ivanovich, who 
                was greatly interested in Zemstvo establishments and attached 
                great importance to them. </p>
              <p> `I really don't know.' </p>
              <p> `What! But surely, you're a member of the board?' </p>
              <p> `No, I'm not a member now; I've resigned,' answered Levin, `and 
                I no longer attend the sessions.' </p>
              <p> `What a pity!' commented Sergei Ivanovich, frowning. </p>
              <p> Levin in self-defense began to describe what took place at the 
                sessions in his district. </p>
              <p> `That's how it always is!' Sergei Ivanovich interrupted him. 
                `We Russians are always like that. Perhaps it's our strong point, 
                really - this faculty of seeing our own shortcomings; but we overdo 
                it, we comfort ourselves with irony, which we always have on the 
                tip of our tongues. All I say is, give such rights as our Zemstvo 
                establishments to any other European people, and... Why, the Germans 
                or the English would have worked their way to freedom with them, 
                while we simply turn them into ridicule.' </p>
              <p> `But how can it be helped?' said Levin penitently. `It was my 
                last trial. And I did try with all my soul. I can't. I'm no good 
                at it.' </p>
              <p> `It's not that you're no good at it,' said Sergei Ivanovich, 
                `it is that you don't look at it as you should.' </p>
              <p> `Perhaps not,' Levin answered dejectedly. </p>
              <p> `Oh! do you know brother Nikolai's turned up again?' </p>
              <p> This brother Nikolai was the elder brother of Constantin Levin, 
                and half-brother of Sergei Ivanovich; a man who was done for, 
                who had dissipated the greater part of his fortune, was living 
                in the strangest and lowest company, and had quarreled with his 
                brothers. </p>
              <p> `What did you say?' Levin cried with horror. `How do you know?' 
              </p>
              <p> `Procophii saw him in the street.' </p>
              <p> `Here in Moscow? Where is he? Do you know?' Levin got up from 
                his chair, as though on the point of starting off at once. </p>
              <p> `I'm sorry I told you,' said Sergei Ivanovich, shaking his head 
                at his younger brother's excitement. `I sent to find out where 
                he is living, and sent him his I O U to Trubin, which I paid. 
                This is the answer he sent me.' </p>
              <p> And Sergei Ivanovich took a note from under a paperweight and 
                handed it to his brother. </p>
              <p> Levin read in the queer, familiar handwriting: `I humbly beg 
                you to leave me in peace. That's the only favor I ask of my gracious 
                brothers. - Nikolai Levin.' </p>
              <p> Levin read it, and without raising his head stood with the note 
                in his hands opposite Sergei Ivanovich. </p>
              <p> There was a struggle in his heart between the desire to forget 
                his unhappy brother for the time, and the consciousness that it 
                would be base to do so. </p>
              <p> `He obviously wants to offend me,' pursued Sergei Ivanovich; 
                `but he cannot offend me, and I should have wished with all my 
                heart to assist him, but I know it's impossible to do that.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes,' repeated Levin. `I understand and appreciate your 
                attitude to him; but I shall go and see him.' </p>
              <p> `If you want to, do; but I shouldn't advise it,' said Sergei 
                Ivanovich. `As regards myself, I have no fear of your doing so; 
                he will not make you quarrel with me; but for your own sake, I 
                should say you would do better not to go. You can't do him any 
                good; still, do as you please.' </p>
              <p> `Very likely I can't do any good, but I feel - especially at 
                such a moment - but that's another thing - I feel I could not 
                be at peace.' </p>
              <p> `Well, that's something I don't understand,' said Sergei Ivanovich. 
                `One thing I do understand,' he added, `it's a lesson in humility. 
                I have come to look very differently and more indulgently on what 
                is called infamy since brother Nikolai has become what he is... 
                you know what he did....' </p>
              <p> `Oh, it's awful, awful!' repeated Levin. </p>
              <p> After obtaining his brother's address from Sergei Ivanovich's 
                footman, Levin was on the point of setting off at once to see 
                him, but on second thought he decided to put off his visit till 
                the evening. The thing to do to set his heart at rest was to accomplish 
                what he had come to Moscow for. From his brother's Levin went 
                to Oblonsky's office, and on getting news of the Shcherbatskys 
                from him, he drove to the place where he had been told he might 
                find Kitty. </p>

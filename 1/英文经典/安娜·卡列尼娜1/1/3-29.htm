              <p><br>
                The carrying out of Levin's plan presented many difficulties; 
                but he struggled on, doing his utmost, and attained a result which, 
                though not what he desired, was enough to enable him, without 
                self-deception, to believe that the attempt was worth the trouble. 
                One of the chief difficulties was that the process of cultivating 
                the land was in full swing, that it was impossible to stop everything 
                and begin it all again from the beginning, and the machine had 
                to be mended while in motion. </p>
              <p>When on the evening of his arrival home he informed the bailiff 
                of his plans, the latter with visible pleasure agreed with what 
                he said, so long as he was pointing out that all that had been 
                done up to that time was stupid and useless. The bailiff said 
                that he had said so a long while ago, but no heed had been paid 
                him. But as for the proposal made by Levin - to take a part as 
                shareholder with his laborers in each agricultural undertaking 
                - at this the bailiff simply expressed a profound despondency, 
                and offered no definite opinion, but began immediately talking 
                of the urgent necessity of carrying the remaining sheaves of rye 
                the next day, and of sending the men out for the second plowing, 
                so that Levin felt that this was not the time for discussing it. 
              </p>
              <p> On beginning to talk to the peasants about it, and making a 
                proposition to cede them the land on new terms, he came into collision 
                with the same great difficulty - that they were so much absorbed 
                by the current work of the day that they had not time to consider 
                the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed scheme. </p>
              <p> The simplehearted Ivan, the cowherd, seemed to grasp Levin's 
                proposal fully - that he should with his family take a share of 
                the profits of the cattle yard - and he was in complete sympathy 
                with the plan. But when Levin hinted at the future advantages, 
                Ivan's face expressed alarm and regret that he could not hear 
                all he had to say, and he made haste to find himself some task 
                that would admit of no delay: he either snatched up the fork to 
                pitch the hay out of the pens, or ran to get water or to clear 
                out the manure. </p>
              <p> Another difficulty lay in the invincible disbelief of the peasants 
                that a landowner's object could be anything else than a desire 
                to squeeze all he could out of them. They were firmly convinced 
                that his real aim (whatever he might say to them) would always 
                be in what he did not say to them. And they themselves, in giving 
                their opinion, said a great deal but never said what was their 
                real object. Moreover (Levin felt that the irascible landowner 
                had been right) the peasants made their first and unalterable 
                condition of any agreement whatsoever that they should not be 
                forced to any new methods of tillage of any kind, nor to use new 
                implements. They agreed that the modern plow plowed better, that 
                the scarifier did the work more quickly, but they found thousands 
                of reasons that made it out of the question for them to use either 
                of them; and though he had accepted the conviction that he would 
                have to lower the standard of cultivation, he felt sorry to give 
                up improved methods, the advantages of which were so obvious. 
                But in spite of all these difficulties he got his way, and by 
                autumn the system was working, or at least so it seemed to him. 
              </p>
              <p> At first Levin had thought of giving up the whole farming of 
                the land just as it was to the peasants, the laborers, and the 
                bailiff, on new conditions of partnership; but he was very soon 
                convinced that this was impossible, and determined to divide it 
                up. The cattle yard, the garden, hayfields, and arable land, divided 
                into several parts, had to be made into separate lots. The simplehearted 
                cowherd, Ivan, who, Levin fancied, understood the matter better 
                than any of them, collecting together a gang of workers to help 
                him, principally of his own family, became a partner in the cattle 
                yard. A distant part of the estate, a tract of wasteland that 
                had lain fallow for eight years, was with the help of the clever 
                carpenter, Fiodor Rezunov, taken by six families of peasants on 
                new conditions of partnership and the peasant Shuraev took the 
                management of all the vegetable gardens on the same terms. The 
                remainder of the land was still worked on the old system, but 
                these three items were the first step to a new organization of 
                the whole, and they completely engrossed Levin. </p>
              <p> It is true that in the cattle yard things went no better than 
                before, and Ivan strenuously opposed warm housing for the cows 
                and butter made of fresh cream, affirming that cows require less 
                food if kept cold, and that butter is more profitable made from 
                sour cream, and he asked for wages just as under the old system, 
                and took not the slightest interest in the fact that the money 
                he received was not wages but an advance out of his future share 
                in the profits. </p>
              <p> It is true that Fiodor Rezunov's company did not plow over the 
                ground twice before sowing, as had been agreed, justifying themselves 
                on the plea that the time was too short. It is true that the peasants 
                of the same company, though they had agreed to work the land on 
                new conditions, always spoke of the land, not as held in partnership, 
                but as rented for half the crop, and more than once the peasants 
                and Rezunov himself said to Levin: `If you would take a rent for 
                the land, it would save you trouble, and we should be more free.' 
                Moreover, the same peasants kept putting off, on various excuses, 
                the building of a cattle yard and threshing barn on the land as 
                agreed upon, and delayed doing it till the winter. </p>
              <p> It is true that Shuraev would have liked to let out the kitchen 
                gardens he had undertaken in small lots to the peasants. He evidently 
                quite misunderstood, and apparently intentionally misunderstood, 
                the conditions upon which the land had been given to him. </p>
              <p> Often, too, talking to the peasants and explaining to them all 
                the advantages of the plan, Levin felt that the peasants heard 
                nothing but the sound of his voice, and were firmly resolved, 
                whatever he might say, not to let themselves be taken in. He felt 
                this especially when he talked to the cleverest of the peasants, 
                Rezunov, and detected that gleam in Rezunov's eyes which showed 
                so plainly both ironical amusement at Levin, and the firm conviction 
                that, if anyone were to be taken in, it would not be he, Rezunov. 
              </p>
              <p> But in spite of all this Levin thought the system worked, and 
                that by keeping accounts strictly, and insisting on his own way, 
                he would prove to them in the future the advantages of the arrangement, 
                and then the system would go of itself. </p>
              <p> These matters, together with the management of the land still 
                left on his hands, and the indoor work over his book, so engrossed 
                Levin the whole summer that he scarcely ever went out shooting. 
                At the end of August he heard that the Oblonskys had gone away 
                to Moscow - from their servant, who brought back the sidesaddle. 
                He felt that in not answering Darya Alexandrovna's letter he had 
                by his rudeness, of which he could not think without a flush of 
                shame, burned his ships, and that he would never go to see them 
                again. He had been just as rude with the Sviiazhskys, leaving 
                them without saying good-by. But he would never go to see them 
                again either. He did not care about that now. The business of 
                reorganizing the farming of his land absorbed him as completely 
                as though there would never be anything else in his life. He read 
                the books lent him by Sviiazhsky, and ordering from Moscow what 
                he had not had, he read both the economic and socialistic books 
                on the subject, but, as he had anticipated, found nothing bearing 
                on the scheme he had undertaken. In the books on political economy 
                - in Mill, for instance - whom he studied first with great ardor, 
                hoping every minute to find an answer to the questions that were 
                engrossing him, he found laws deduced from the condition of land 
                culture in Europe; but he did not see why these laws, which did 
                not apply in Russia, must be general. He saw just the same thing 
                in the socialistic books: either they were the beautiful but impracticable 
                fantasies which had fascinated him when he was a student, or they 
                were attempts at improving, at rectifying the economic position 
                in which Europe was placed, with which the system of land tenure 
                in Russia had nothing in common. Political economy told him that 
                the laws by which the wealth of Europe had been developed, and 
                was developing, were universal and unvarying. Socialism told him 
                that development along these lines leads to ruin. And neither 
                of them gave an answer, or even a hint, in reply to the question 
                as to what he, Levin, and all the Russian peasants and landowners, 
                were to do with their millions of hands and millions of dessiatinas, 
                to make them as productive as possible for the common weal. </p>
              <p> Having once taken the subject up, he read conscientiously everything 
                bearing on it, and intended in the autumn to go abroad to study 
                land systems on the spot, in order that he might not on this question 
                be confronted with what so often met him on various subjects. 
                Often, just as he was beginning to understand the idea in the 
                mind of anyone he was talking to, and was beginning to explain 
                his own, he would suddenly be told: `But Kauffmann, but Jones, 
                but Dubois, but Michelli? You haven't read them: do read, they've 
                thrashed that question out thoroughly.' </p>
              <p> He saw now distinctly that Kauffmann and Michelli had nothing 
                to tell him. He knew what he wanted. He saw that Russia had splendid 
                land, splendid laborers, and that in certain cases, as at the 
                peasant's on the way to Sviiazhsky's, the produce raised by the 
                laborers and the land is great - in the majority of cases when 
                capital is applied in the European way the produce is small, and 
                that this simply arises from the fact that the laborers want to 
                work and work well only in their own peculiar way, and that this 
                antagonism is not incidental but invariable, and has its roots 
                in the national spirit. He thought that the Russian people whose 
                task it was to colonize and cultivate vast tracts of unoccupied 
                land, consciously adhered, till all their land was occupied, to 
                the methods suitable to their purpose, and that their methods 
                were by no means so bad as was generally supposed. And he wanted 
                to prove this theoretically in his book and practically on his 
                land. </p>

              <p><br>
                After lunch Levin was not in the same place in the string of mowers 
                as before, but stood between the old man who had accosted him 
                jocosely, and now invited him to be his neighbor, and a young 
                peasant, who had only been married in the autumn, and who was 
                mowing this summer for the first time. <br>
                The old man, holding himself erect, moved in front, with his feet 
                turned out, taking long, regular strides, and with a precise and 
                regular action which seemed to cost him no more effort than swinging 
                one's arms in walking, as though it were in play, he laid down 
                the high, even swath of grass. It was as though it were not he 
                but the sharp scythe of itself swishing through the juicy grass. 
              </p>
              <p> Behind Levin came the lad Mishka. His comely, youthful face, 
                with a twist of fresh grass bound round his hair, was all working 
                with effort; but whenever anyone looked at him he smiled. He would 
                clearly have died sooner than own it was hard work for him. </p>
              <p><br>
                Levin kept between them. In the very heat of the day the mowing 
                did not seem such hard work to him. The perspiration with which 
                he was drenched cooled him, while the sun, that burned his back, 
                his head, and his arms, bare to the elbow, gave a vigor and dogged 
                energy to his labor; and more and more often now came those moments 
                of unconsciousness, when it was possible not to think of what 
                one was doing. The scythe cut of itself. These were happy moments. 
                Still more delightful were the moments when they reached the stream 
                where the swaths ended, and the old man rubbed his scythe with 
                the wet, thick grass, rinsed its blade in the fresh water of the 
                stream, ladled out a little in a whetstone case, and offered Levin 
                a drink. </p>
              <p> `What do you say to my kvass, eh? Good, eh?' he would say, winking. 
              </p>
              <p> And truly Levin had never drunk any liquor as good as this warm 
                water with green bits floating in it, and a taste of rust from 
                the tin whetstone case. And immediately after this came the delicious, 
                slow saunter, with his hand on the scythe, during which he could 
                wipe away the streaming sweat, take deep breaths of air, and look 
                about at the long string of mowers, and at what was happening 
                around in the forest and the field. </p>
              <p> The longer Levin mowed, the oftener he felt the moments of unconsciousness 
                in which it seemed that it was not his hands which swung the scythe, 
                but that the scythe was moving together with itself a body full 
                of life and consciousness of its own; and as though by magic, 
                without thinking of it, the work turned out regular and well-finished 
                of itself. These were the most blissful moments. </p>
              <p> It was only hard work when he had to break off the motion, which 
                had become unconscious, and to think; when he had to mow round 
                a hummock or an unweeded tuft of sorrel. The old man did this 
                easily. When a hummock came he changed his action, and at one 
                time with the heel, and at another with the tip of his scythe, 
                clipped the hummock round both sides with short strokes. And while 
                he did this he kept looking about and watching what came into 
                his view: at one moment he picked a wild berry and ate it or offered 
                it to Levin, then he flung away a twig with the blade of the scythe, 
                then he looked at a quail's nest, from which the bird flew just 
                under the scythe, or caught a snake that crossed his path, and 
                lifting it on the scythe as though on a fork showed it to Levin 
                and threw it away. </p>
              <p> For both Levin and the young peasant behind him, such changes 
                of position were difficult. Both of them, repeating over and over 
                again the same strained movement, were in a perfect frenzy of 
                toil, and were incapable of shifting their position and at the 
                same time watching what was before them. </p>
              <p> Levin did not notice how time was passing. If he had been asked 
                how long he had been working he would have said half an hour - 
                yet it was getting on to dinnertime. As they were walking back 
                over the cut grass, the old man called Levin's attention to the 
                little girls and boys who were coming from different directions, 
                hardly visible through the long grass, and along the road toward 
                the mowers, carrying sacks of bread that stretched their little 
                arms, and lugging small pitchers of kvass, stopped up with rags. 
              </p>
              <p> `Look'ee at the little doodlebugs crawling!' he said, pointing 
                to them, and he shaded his eyes with his hand to look at the sun. 
              </p>
              <p> They mowed two more swaths; the old man stopped. </p>
              <p> `Come, master, dinnertime!' he said decidedly. And on reaching 
                the stream the mowers moved off across the swaths toward their 
                pile of coats, where the children who had brought their dinners 
                were sitting waiting for them. The peasants gathered - those who 
                came from afar under their telegas, those who lived near under 
                a willow bush, covered with grass. </p>
              <p> Levin sat down by them; he felt disinclined to go away. </p>
              <p> All constraint with the master had disappeared long ago. The 
                peasants got ready for dinner. Some washed, the young lads bathed 
                in the stream, others made a place comfortable for a rest, untied 
                their sacks of bread, and uncovered the pitchers of kvass. The 
                old man crumbled up some bread in a cup, stirred it with the handle 
                of a spoon, poured water on it from his whetstone case, broke 
                up some more bread, and having seasoned it with salt, he turned 
                to the east to say his prayer. </p>
              <p> `Come, master, taste my sop,' said he, kneeling down before 
                the cup. </p>
              <p> The sop was so good that Levin gave up the idea of going home 
                for dinner. He ate with the old man, and talked to him about his 
                family affairs, taking the keenest interest in them, and told 
                him about his own affairs and all the circumstances that could 
                be of interest to the old man. He felt much nearer to him than 
                to his brother, and could not help smiling at the affection he 
                felt for this man. When the old man got up again, said his prayer, 
                and lay down under a bush, putting some grass under his head for 
                a pillow, Levin did the same, and, in spite of the clinging flies 
                that were so persistent in the sunshine, and the midges that tickled 
                his hot face and body, he fell asleep at once and only waked when 
                the sun had passed to the other side of the bush and reached him. 
                The old man had been awake a long while, and was sitting up whetting 
                the scythes of the younger lads. </p>
              <p> Levin looked about him and hardly recognized the place, everything 
                was so changed. The immense stretch of meadow had been mown and 
                was sparkling with a peculiar fresh brilliance, with its lines 
                of already sweet-smelling grass in the slanting rays of the evening 
                sun. And the bushes about the river, mowed around, and the river 
                itself, not visible before, now gleaming, like steel in its bends, 
                and the moving, ascending peasants, and the sharp wall of grass 
                of the unmown part of the meadow, and the hawks hovering over 
                the stripped meadow - all was perfectly new. Raising himself, 
                Levin began considering how much had been cut and how much more 
                could still be done that day. </p>
              <p> The work done was exceptionally great for forty-two men. They 
                had cut the whole of the big meadow, which had, in the years of 
                corvee, taken thirty scythes two days to mow. Only the corners 
                remained to do, where the swaths were short. But Levin felt a 
                longing to get as much mowing done that day as possible, and was 
                vexed with the sun sinking so quickly in the sky. He felt no weariness; 
                all he wanted was to get his work done more and more quickly, 
                and as much of it as possible. </p>
              <p> `Could we cut the Mashkin Upland too? - what do you think?' 
                he said to the old man. </p>
              <p> `As God wills - the sun's not high. A little vodka for the lads?' 
              </p>
              <p> At the afternoon rest, when they were sitting down again, and 
                those who smoked had lighted their pipes, the old man told the 
                men that `the Mashkin Upland's to be cut - there'll be vodka.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Why not cut it? Come on, Tit! We'll look sharp! We can eat 
                at night. Come on!' voices cried out, and eating up their bread, 
                the mowers went back to work. </p>
              <p> `Come, lads, keep it up!' said Tit, and ran on ahead almost 
                at a trot. </p>
              <p> `Get along, get along!' said the old man, hurrying after him 
                and easily overtaking him, `I'll mow thee down, look out!' </p>
              <p> And young and old mowed away, as though they were racing with 
                one another. But however fast they worked, they did not spoil 
                the grass, and the swaths were laid just as neatly and exactly. 
                The little piece left uncut in the corner was mown in five minutes. 
                The last of the mowers were just ending their swaths while the 
                foremost snatched up their coats onto their shoulders, and crossed 
                the road toward the Mashkin Upland. </p>
              <p> The sun was already sinking among the trees when they went with 
                their jingling whetstone cases into the wooded ravine of the Mashkin 
                Upland. The grass was up to their waists in the middle of the 
                hollow, lush, tender, and feathery, spotted here and there among 
                the trees with wild heartsease. </p>
              <p> After a brief consultation - whether to take the swaths lengthwise 
                or diagonally - Prokhor Iermilin, also a doughty mower, a huge, 
                black-haired peasant, went on ahead. He went up to the top, turned 
                back again and started mowing, and they all proceeded to form 
                in line behind him, going downhill through the hollow and uphill 
                right up to the edge of the forest. The sun sank behind the forest. 
                The dew was falling by now; the mowers were in the sun only on 
                the hillside, but below, where a mist was rising, and on the opposite 
                side, they mowed into the fresh, dewy shade. The work went rapidly. 
              </p>
              <p> The spicily fragrant grass cut with a succulent sound, was at 
                once laid in high swaths. The mowers from all sides, brought closer 
                together in the short swath, kept urging one another on to the 
                sound of jingling whetstone cases, and clanging scythes, and the 
                hiss of the whetstones sharpening them, and good-humored shouts. 
              </p>
              <p> Levin still kept between the young peasant and the old man. 
                The old man, who had put on his short sheepskin jacket, was just 
                as good-humored, jocose, and free in his movements. Among the 
                trees they were continually cutting with their scythes the so-called 
                `birch mushrooms,' swollen fat in the succulent grass. But the 
                old man bent down every time he came across a mushroom, picked 
                it up and put it in his bosom. `Another present for my old woman,' 
                he would say as he did so. </p>
              <p> Easy as it was to mow the wet, lush grass, it was hard work 
                going up and down the steep sides of the ravine. But this did 
                not trouble the old man. Swinging his scythe just as ever, and 
                moving his feet in their big, plaited bast sandals, with firm 
                short steps, he climbed slowly up the steep place, and though 
                his breeches hanging out below his smock, and his whole frame, 
                trembled with effort, he did not miss one blade of grass or one 
                mushroom on his way, and kept making jokes with the peasants and 
                Levin. Levin walked after him and often thought he must fall, 
                as he climbed with a scythe up a steep hillock, where it would 
                have been hard work to clamber even without the scythe. But he 
                climbed up and did what he had to do. He felt as though some external 
                force were moving him. </p>

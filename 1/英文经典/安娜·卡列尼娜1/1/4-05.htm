              <p><br>
                The waiting room of the celebrated Peterburg lawyer was full when 
                Alexei Alexandrovich entered it. Three ladies - an old lady, a 
                young lady, and a merchant's wife, and three gentlemen - one a 
                German banker with a ring on his finger, the second a merchant 
                with a beard, and the third a wrathful-looking government clerk 
                in official uniform, with a cross on his neck - had obviously 
                been waiting a long while already. Two clerks were writing at 
                tables with scratching pens. The appurtenances of the writing 
                tables, about which Alexei Alexandrovich was himself very fastidious, 
                were exceptionally good. He could not help observing this. One 
                of the clerks, without getting up, turned fretfully to Alexei 
                Alexandrovich, half-closing his eyes. </p>
              <p>`What is it you wish?' </p>
              <p> `My business has to do with the lawyer.' </p>
              <p> `He is engaged,' the clerk responded severely, and he pointed 
                with his pen at the persons waiting, and went on writing. </p>
              <p> `Can't he spare time to see me?' said Alexei Alexandrovich. 
              </p>
              <p> `He has no time free; he is always busy. Kindly wait your turn.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Then I must trouble you to give him my card,' Alexei Alexandrovich 
                said with dignity, seeing the impossibility of preserving his 
                incognito. </p>
              <p> The clerk took the card and, obviously not approving of what 
                he read on it, went to the door. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich was in principle in favor of the publicity 
                of legal proceedings, though for some higher official considerations 
                he disliked the application of the principle in Russia, and disapproved 
                of it, as far as he could disapprove of anything instituted by 
                authority of the Emperor. His whole life had been spent in administrative 
                work, and consequently, when he did not approve of anything, his 
                disapproval was softened by the recognition of the inevitability 
                of mistakes and the possibility of reform in every department. 
                In the new public law courts he disliked the restrictions laid 
                on the lawyers conducting cases. But till then he had had nothing 
                to do with the law courts, and so had disapproved of their publicity 
                simply in theory; now his disapprobation was strengthened by the 
                unpleasant impression made on him in the lawyer's waiting room. 
              </p>
              <p> `He will be out right away,' said the clerk; and two minutes 
                later there did actually appear in the doorway the large figure 
                of an old student of jurisprudence who had been consulting with 
                the lawyer, and the lawyer himself. </p>
              <p> The lawyer was a little, squat, bald man, with a dark, reddish 
                beard, light-colored long eyebrows, and beetling brow. He was 
                attired as though for a wedding, from his cravat to his double 
                watch chain and patent-leather shoes. His face was clever and 
                rustic, but his dress was dandified and in bad taste. </p>
              <p> `Pray walk in,' said the lawyer, addressing Alexei Alexandrovich; 
                and, gloomily ushering Karenin in before him, he closed the door. 
                `Won't you sit down?' He indicated an armchair at a writing table 
                covered with papers. He sat down himself, and, rubbing his little 
                hands with short fingers covered with white hairs, he bent his 
                head on one side. But as soon as he was settled in this position 
                a moth flew over the table. The lawyer, with a swiftness that 
                could never have been expected of him, opened his hands, caught 
                the moth, and resumed his former attitude. </p>
              <p> `Before beginning to speak of my business,' said Alexei Alexandrovich, 
                following the lawyer's movements with wondering eyes, `I ought 
                to observe that the matter about which I have to speak to you 
                is to be a secret.' </p>
              <p> The lawyer's drooping reddish mustaches were stirred by a scarcely 
                perceptible smile. </p>
              <p> `I should not be a lawyer if I could not keep the secrets confided 
                to me. But if you would like proof...' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich glanced at his face, and saw that the shrewd, 
                gray eyes were laughing, and seemed to know all about it already. 
              </p>
              <p> `You know my name?' Alexei Alexandrovich resumed. </p>
              <p> `I know you and the good' - again he caught a moth - `work you 
                are doing, like every Russian,' said the lawyer, bowing. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich sighed, plucking up his courage. But, having 
                once made up his mind, he went on in his shrill voice, without 
                timidity or hesitation, accentuating a word here and there. </p>
              <p> `I have the misfortune,' Alexei Alexandrovich began, `to be 
                a deceived husband, and I desire to break off all relations with 
                my wife by legal means - that is, to be divorced; but do this 
                so that my son may not remain with his mother.' </p>
              <p> The lawyer's gray eyes tried not to laugh, but they were dancing 
                with irrepressible glee, and Alexei Alexandrovich saw that it 
                was not simply the delight of a man who has just got a profitable 
                job: there was triumph and joy, there was a gleam like the malignant 
                gleam he had seen in his wife's eyes. </p>
              <p> `You desire my assistance in securing a divorce?' </p>
              <p> `Yes, precisely; but I ought to warn you that I may be wasting 
                your time and attention. I have come simply to consult you as 
                a preliminary step. I want a divorce, but the form which it may 
                take is of great consequence to me. It is very possible that if 
                that form does not correspond with my requirements I may give 
                up a legal action.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, that's always the case,' said the lawyer, `and that's always 
                for you to decide.' </p>
              <p> He let his eyes rest on Alexei Alexandrovich's feet, feeling 
                that he might offend his client by the sight of his irrepressible 
                amusement. He looked at a moth that flew before his nose, and 
                moved his hand, but did not catch it from regard for Alexei Alexandrovich's 
                situation. </p>
              <p> `Though in their general features our laws on this subject are 
                known to me,' pursued Alexei Alexandrovich, `I should be glad 
                to have an idea of the forms in which such things are done, in 
                practice.' </p>
              <p> `You would be glad,' the lawyer, without lifting his eyes, responded, 
                adopting, with a certain satisfaction, the tone of his client's 
                remarks, `for me to lay before you all the methods by which you 
                could secure what you desire?' </p>
              <p> And on receiving an assenting nod from Alexei Alexandrovich, 
                he went on, stealing a glance now and then at Alexei Alexandrovich's 
                face, which was growing red in patches. </p>
              <p> `Divorce by our laws,' he said, with a slight shade of disapprobation 
                of our laws, `is possible, as you are aware, in the following 
                cases... To wait!' he called to a clerk who put his head in at 
                the door, but he got up all the same, said a few words to him, 
                and sat down again. `In the following cases: physical defect in 
                the married parties, desertion without communication for five 
                years,' he said, crooking a short finger covered with hair, `adultery' 
                (this word he pronounced with obvious satisfaction), `subdivided 
                as follows' (he continued to crook his fat fingers, though the 
                cases and their subdivisions could obviously not be classified 
                together): `physical defect of the husband or of the wife, adultery 
                of the husband or of the wife.' As by now all his fingers were 
                used up, he straightened them and went on: `This is the theoretical 
                view; but I imagine you have done me the honor to apply to me 
                in order to learn its application in practice. And therefore, 
                guided by precedents, I must inform you that in practice cases 
                of divorce may all be reduced to the following - there's no physical 
                defect, I may assume, nor desertion?...' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich bowed his head in assent. </p>
              <p> `They may be reduced to the following: adultery of one of the 
                married parties, and the detection in the fact of the guilty party 
                by mutual agreement, and, failing such agreement, accidental detection. 
                It must be admitted that the latter case is rarely met with in 
                practice,' said the lawyer, and stealing a glance at Alexei Alexandrovich 
                he paused, as a man selling pistols, after enlarging on the advantages 
                of each weapon, might await his customer's choice. But Alexei 
                Alexandrovich said nothing, and therefore the lawyer went on: 
                `The most usual and simple, the sensible course, I consider, is 
                adultery by mutual consent. I should not permit myself to express 
                it so, speaking with a man of no education,' he said, `but I imagine 
                that to you this is comprehensible.' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich was, however, so perturbed that he did 
                not immediately comprehend all the reasonableness of adultery 
                by mutual consent, and his eyes expressed this uncertainty; but 
                the lawyer promptly came to his assistance. </p>
              <p> `People cannot go on living together - here you have a fact. 
                And if both are agreed about it, the details and formalities become 
                a matter of no importance. And at the same time this is the simplest 
                and most certain method.' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich understood fully now. But he had religious 
                scruples, which hindered the execution of such a plan. </p>
              <p> `That is out of the question in the present case,' he said. 
                `Only one alternative is possible: involuntary detection, supported 
                by letters which I have.' </p>
              <p> At the mention of letters the lawyer pursed up his lips, and 
                gave utterance to a thin little compassionate and contemptuous 
                sound. </p>
              <p> `Kindly consider,' he began, `cases of that kind are, as you 
                are aware, under ecclesiastical jurisdiction; the reverend fathers 
                are fond of going into the minutest details in cases of that kind,' 
                he said, with a smile which betrayed his sympathy with the taste 
                of the reverend fathers. `Letters may, of course, be a partial 
                confirmation; but detection in the act there must be of the most 
                direct kind - that is, by eyewitnesses. In fact, if you do me 
                the honor to trust me with your confidence, you will do well to 
                leave me the choice of the measures to be employed. If one wants 
                the result, one must allow the means.' </p>
              <p> `If it is so...' Alexei Alexandrovich began, suddenly turning 
                white; but at that moment the lawyer rose and again went to the 
                door to speak to the intruding clerk. </p>
              <p> `Tell her we don't haggle over fees!' he said, and returned 
                to Alexei Alexandrovich. </p>
              <p> On his way back he caught, unobserved, another moth. `Nice state 
                my rep curtains will be in by the summer!' he thought, frowning. 
              </p>
              <p> `And so you were saying?...' he said. </p>
              <p> `I will communicate my decision to you by letter,' said Alexei 
                Alexandrovich, getting up, and he clutched at the table. After 
                standing a moment in silence, he said: `From your words I may 
                consequently conclude that a divorce may be obtained? I would 
                ask you to let me know what your terms are.' </p>
              <p> `It may be obtained if you give me complete liberty of action,' 
                said the lawyer, without answering his question. `When can I count 
                on receiving word from you?' he asked moving toward the door, 
                his eyes and his patent-leather shoes shining. </p>
              <p> `In a week's time. You will be kind enough to communicate to 
                me your answer as to whether you will undertake to conduct the 
                case, and on what terms.' </p>
              <p> `Very good, sir.' </p>
              <p> The lawyer bowed respectfully, let his client out of the door, 
                and, left alone, gave himself up to his sense of amusement. He 
                felt so mirthful that, contrary to his rule, he made a reduction 
                in his terms to the haggling lady, and gave up catching moths, 
                finally deciding that next winter he must have the furniture covered 
                with velvet, like Sigonin's. </p>

              <p><br>
                Sviiazhsky was the marshal of his district. He was five years 
                older than Levin, and had long been married. His sister-in-law, 
                a young girl Levin liked very much, lived in his house; and Levin 
                knew that Sviiazhsky and his wife would have greatly liked to 
                marry the girl to him. He knew this with certainty, as so-called 
                eligible young men always know it, though he could never have 
                brought himself to speak of it to anyone; and he also knew that, 
                although he wanted to get married, and although by every token 
                this very attractive girl would make an excellent wife, he could 
                no more have married her, even if he had not been in love with 
                Kitty Shcherbatskaia, than he could have flown up to the sky. 
                And this knowledge poisoned the pleasure he had hoped to find 
                in the visit to Sviiazhsky. </p>
              <p>On getting Sviiazhsky's letter with the invitation for shooting, 
                Levin had immediately thought of this; but, in spite of it, he 
                had made up his mind that Sviiazhsky's having such views for him 
                was simply his own groundless supposition, and so he would go, 
                notwithstanding. Besides, at the bottom of his heart, he had a 
                desire to try himself, to put himself to the test in regard to 
                this girl. The Sviiazhskys' home life was exceedingly pleasant, 
                and Sviiazhsky himself, the best type of Zemstvo man that Levin 
                knew, was very interesting to him. </p>
              <p> Sviiazhsky was one of those people, always a source of wonder 
                to Levin, whose convictions, very logical though never original, 
                go one way by themselves, while their life, exceedingly definite 
                and firm in its course, goes its way quite apart and almost always 
                in direct contradiction to their convictions. Sviiazhsky was an 
                extremely advanced man. He despised the nobility, and believed 
                the mass of the nobility to be secretly in favor of serfdom, and 
                only concealing their views out of cowardice. He regarded Russia 
                as a ruined country, rather after the style of Turkey, and the 
                government of Russia as so bad that he never permitted himself 
                to criticize its doings seriously, and yet he was a functionary 
                of that government, and a model marshal of nobility, and when 
                he drove about he always wore his cap with the cockade and red 
                band. He considered human life only tolerable abroad, and went 
                abroad to stay at every opportunity, and at the same time he carried 
                on a complex and improved system of agriculture in Russia, and 
                with extreme interest followed everything and knew everything 
                that was being done in Russia. He considered the Russian peasant 
                as occupying a stage of development intermediate between the ape 
                and the man, and at the same time in the days of Zemstvo election 
                no one was readier to shake hands with the peasants and listen 
                to their opinion. He believed neither in God nor the devil, but 
                was much concerned about the question of the improvement of the 
                clergy and the maintenance of their revenues, and took special 
                trouble to keep up the church in his village. </p>
              <p> On the woman question he was on the side of the extreme advocates 
                of complete liberty for women, and especially their right to labor. 
                But he lived with his wife on such terms that their affectionate, 
                childless home life was the admiration of everyone, and arranged 
                his wife's life so that she did nothing and could do nothing but 
                share her husband's preoccupations in spending their time as happily 
                and as agreeably as possible. </p>
              <p> If it had not been a characteristic of Levin to put the most 
                favorable interpretation on people, Sviiazhsky's character would 
                have presented no doubt or difficulty to him: he would have said 
                to himself, `a fool or a knave,' and everything would have seemed 
                clear. But he could not say a fool, because Sviiazhsky was unmistakably 
                clever, and, moreover, a highly cultivated man, who was exceptionally 
                modest over his culture. There was not a subject he knew nothing 
                of. But he did not display his knowledge except when he was compelled 
                to do so. Still less could Levin say that he was a knave, as Sviiazhsky 
                was unmistakably an honest, goodhearted, sensible man, who worked 
                good-humoredly, keenly, and perseveringly at his work, which was 
                held in high honor by everyone about him, and certainly he had 
                never consciously done, and was indeed incapable of doing, anything 
                base. </p>
              <p> Levin tried to understand him, and could not understand him, 
                and looked at him and his life as at a living enigma. </p>
              <p> Levin and he were very friendly, and so Levin used to venture 
                to sound Sviiazhsky, to try to get at the very foundation of his 
                view of life; but it was always in vain. Every time Levin tried 
                to penetrate beyond the outer chambers of Sviiazhsky's mind, which 
                were hospitably open to all, he noticed that Sviiazhsky was slightly 
                disconcerted; faint signs of alarm were visible in his eyes, as 
                though he were afraid Levin would understand him, and he would 
                give him a kindly, good-humored rebuff. </p>
              <p> Just now, since his disenchantment with farming, Levin was particularly 
                glad to stay with Sviiazhsky. Apart from the fact that the sight 
                of this happy and affectionate couple, so pleased with themselves 
                and everyone else, and their well-ordered home, had always a cheering 
                effect on Levin, he felt a longing, now that he was so dissatisfied 
                with his own life, to get at that secret in Sviiazhsky which gave 
                him such clarity, definiteness, and good courage in life. Moreover, 
                Levin knew that at Sviiazhsky's he would meet the landowners of 
                the neighborhood, and it was particularly interesting for him 
                just now to hear and take part in those rural conversations concerning 
                crops, laborers' wages, and so on, which, Levin was aware, are 
                conventionally regarded as something very low, but which seemed 
                to him just now to constitute the one subject of importance. `It 
                was not, perhaps, of importance in the days of serfdom, and it 
                may not be of importance in England. In both cases the conditions 
                of agriculture are firmly established; but among us now, when 
                everything has been turned topsy-turvy, and is only just taking 
                shape, the question what form these conditions will take is the 
                one question of importance in Russia,' thought Levin. </p>
              <p> The shooting turned out to be poorer than Levin expected. The 
                marsh was dry and there were no snipe at all. He walked about 
                the whole day and only brought back three birds, but to make up 
                for that he brought back, as he always did from shooting, an excellent 
                appetite, excellent spirits, and that keen, intellectual mood 
                which with him always accompanied violent physical exertion. And 
                while out shooting, when he seemed to be thinking of nothing at 
                all, the old man and his family would time and again come to mind, 
                and the impression of them seemed to claim not merely his attention, 
                but the solution of some question connected with them. </p>
              <p> In the evening, at tea, two landowners who had come about some 
                business connected with a wardship were of the party, and the 
                interesting conversation Levin had been looking forward to sprang 
                up. </p>
              <p> Levin was sitting beside his hostess at the tea table, and was 
                obliged to keep up a conversation with her and her sister, who 
                was sitting opposite him. Madame Sviiazhsky was a round-faced, 
                fair-haired, rather short woman, all smiles and dimples. Levin 
                tried through her to get at a solution of the weighty enigma her 
                husband presented to his mind; but he had not complete freedom 
                of ideas, because he was in an agony of embarrassment. This agony 
                of embarrassment was due to the fact that the sister-in-law was 
                sitting opposite to him, in a dress, specially put on, as he fancied, 
                for his benefit, cut particularly open, in the shape of a trapeze, 
                at her white bosom. This quadrangular opening, in spite of the 
                bosom's being very white, or just because it was very white, deprived 
                Levin of the full use of his faculties. He imagined, probably 
                mistakenly, that this low-necked bodice had been made on his account, 
                and felt that he had no right to look at it, and tried not to 
                look at it; but he felt that he was to blame for the very fact 
                of the low-necked bodice having been made. It seemed to Levin 
                that he had imposed upon someone, that he ought to explain something, 
                but that to explain it was impossible, and for that reason he 
                was continually blushing, was ill at ease and awkward. His awkwardness 
                infected the pretty sister-in-law too. But their hostess appeared 
                not to observe this, and kept purposely drawing her into the conversation. 
              </p>
              <p> `You say,' she said, pursuing the subject that had been started, 
                `that my husband cannot be interested in what's Russian. It's 
                quite the contrary; he is in cheerful spirits abroad, but never 
                in such as he is here. Here he feels in his proper place. He has 
                so much to do, and he has the faculty of interesting himself in 
                everything. Oh, you've not been to see our school, have you?' 
              </p>
              <p> `I've seen it.... The little house covered with ivy, isn't it?' 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes; that's Nastia's work,' she said, indicating her sister. 
              </p>
              <p> `You teach in it yourself?' asked Levin, trying to look above 
                the open neck, but feeling that no matter where he looked in that 
                direction he should see it. </p>
              <p> `Yes; I used to teach in it myself, and do teach still, but 
                we have a first-rate schoolmistress now. And we've started gymnastic 
                exercises.' </p>
              <p> `No, thank you, I won't have any more tea,' said Levin, and 
                conscious of doing a rude thing, but incapable of continuing the 
                conversation, he got up, blushing. `I hear a very interesting 
                conversation,' he added, and walked to the other end of the table, 
                where Sviiazhsky was sitting with the two gentlemen of the neighborhood. 
                Sviiazhsky was sitting sideways, with one elbow on the table, 
                and a cup in one hand, while with the other hand he gathered up 
                his beard, held it to his nose and let it drop again, as though 
                he were smelling it. His brilliant black eyes were looking directly 
                at the excited country gentleman with gray mustaches, and apparently 
                he derived amusement from his remarks. The gentleman was complaining 
                of the peasants. It was evident to Levin that Sviiazhsky knew 
                the answer to this gentleman's complaints, which would at once 
                demolish his whole contention, but that in his position he could 
                not give utterance to this answer, and listened, not without pleasure, 
                to the landowner's comic talk. </p>
              <p> The gentleman with the gray mustaches was obviously an inveterate 
                adherent of serfdom and a devoted agriculturist, who had lived 
                all his life in the country. Levin saw proofs of this in his dress, 
                in his old-fashioned threadbare coat, obviously not his everyday 
                attire, in his shrewd, deep-set eyes, in his coherent Russian, 
                in the imperious tone that had become habitual from long use, 
                and in the resolute gestures of his large, beautiful sunburned 
                hands, with a single old wedding ring on his fourth finger. </p>

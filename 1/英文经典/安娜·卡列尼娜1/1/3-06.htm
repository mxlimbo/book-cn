              <p align="center" class="h">Chapter 6</p>
              <p><br>
                The Mashkin Upland was mown, the last swaths finished, the peasants 
                had put on their coats and were gaily trudging home. Levin got 
                on his horse, and, parting regretfully from the peasants, rode 
                homeward. On the hillside he looked back; he could not see them 
                in the mist that had risen from the valley; he could only hear 
                their rough, good-humored voices, their laughter, and the sound 
                of clanking scythes. </p>
              <p>Sergei Ivanovich had long ago finished dinner, and was drinking 
                iced lemonade in his own room, looking through the reviews and 
                papers which he had just received by post, when Levin rushed into 
                the room, talking merrily, with his wet and matted hair sticking 
                to his forehead, and his back and chest grimed and moist. </p>
              <p> `We mowed the whole meadow! Oh, it is fine, wonderful! And how 
                have you been getting on?' said Levin, completely forgetting the 
                disagreeable conversation of the previous day. </p>
              <p> `Dear me! What you look like!' said Sergei Ivanovich, for the 
                first moment looking round with some dissatisfaction. `And the 
                door - do shut the door!' he cried. `You must have let in a dozen 
                at least.' </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich could not endure flies, and in his own room 
                he never opened the window except at night, and carefully kept 
                the door shut. </p>
              <p> `Not one, on my honor. But if I have, I'll catch them. You wouldn't 
                believe what a pleasure mowing is! How have you spent the day?' 
              </p>
              <p> `Very well. But have you really been mowing the whole day? I 
                expect you're as hungry as a wolf. Kouzma has got everything ready 
                for you.' </p>
              <p> `No, I don't feel hungry even. I had something to eat there. 
                But I'll go and wash.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, go along, go along, and I'll come to you directly,' said 
                Sergei Ivanovich, shaking his head as he looked at his brother. 
                `Go along, make haste,' he added smiling, and, gathering up his 
                books, he prepared to go too. He, too, felt suddenly good-humored 
                and disinclined to leave his brother's side. `But what did you 
                do while it was raining?' </p>
              <p> `Rain? Why, there was scarcely a drop. I'll come directly. So 
                you had a good day too? That's first-rate.' And Levin went off 
                to change his clothes. </p>
              <p> Five minutes later the brothers met in the dining room. Although 
                it seemed to Levin that he was not hungry, and he sat down to 
                dinner simply so as not to hurt Kouzma's feelings, yet when he 
                began to eat the dinner struck him as extraordinarily good. Sergei 
                Ivanovich watched him with a smile. </p>
              <p> `Oh, by the way, there's a letter for you,' said he. `Kouzma, 
                bring it from below, please. And mind you shut the doors.' </p>
              <p> The letter was from Oblonsky. Levin read it aloud. Oblonsky 
                wrote to him from Peterburg: `I have had a letter from Dolly; 
                she's at Ergushovo, and everything seems going wrong there. Do 
                ride over and see her, please; help her with advice; you know 
                all about it. She will be so glad to see you. She's quite alone, 
                poor thing. My mother-in-law and all of them are still abroad.' 
              </p>
              <p> `That's capital! I will certainly ride over to her,' said Levin. 
                `Or we'll go together. She's such a good woman, isn't she?' </p>
              <p> `They're not far from here, then?' </p>
              <p> `Thirty verstas. Or perhaps forty. But a capital road. It will 
                be a capital drive.' </p>
              <p> `I shall be delighted,' said Sergei Ivanovich, still smiling. 
              </p>
              <p> The sight of his younger brother's appearance had immediately 
                put him in a good humor. </p>
              <p> `Well, you have an appetite!' he said, looking at his dark-red, 
                sunburned face and neck bent over the plate. </p>
              <p> `Splendid! You can't imagine what an effective remedy it is 
                for every sort of foolishness. I want to enrich medicine with 
                a new word: Arbeitskur.' </p>
              <p> `Well, but you don't need it, I should fancy.' </p>
              <p> `No - but for all sorts of nervous invalids.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, it ought to be tried. I had meant to come to the mowing 
                to look at you, but it was so unbearably hot that I got no further 
                than the forest. I sat there a little, and went on by the forest 
                to the village, met your old nurse, and sounded her as to the 
                peasant's view of you. As far as I can make out, they don't approve 
                of this. She said: ``It's not a gentleman's work.' Altogether, 
                I fancy that in the people's ideas there are very clear and definite 
                notions of certain, as they call it, ``gentlemanly' lines of action. 
                And they don't sanction the gentlefolk's moving outside bounds 
                clearly laid down in their ideas.' </p>
              <p> `Maybe so; but anyway, it's a pleasure such as I have never 
                known in my life. And there's no harm in it, you know. Is there?' 
                answered Levin. `I can't help it if they don't like it. Though 
                I do believe it's all right. Eh?' </p>
              <p> `Altogether,' pursued Sergei Ivanovich, `you're satisfied with 
                your day?' </p>
              <p> `Quite satisfied. We cut the whole meadow. And I made friends 
                with such a splendid old man there! You can't fancy how delightful 
                he was!' </p>
              <p> `Well, so you're satisfied with your day. And so am I. First, 
                I solved two chess problems, and one a very pretty one - a pawn 
                opening. I'll show it to you. And then - I thought over our conversation 
                of yesterday.' </p>
              <p> `Eh! Our conversation of yesterday?' said Levin, blissfully 
                dropping his eyelids and drawing deep breaths after finishing 
                his dinner, and absolutely incapable of recalling what their conversation 
                of yesterday had been about. </p>
              <p> `I think you are partly right. Our difference of opinion amounts 
                to this: that you make the mainspring self-interest, while I contend 
                that interest in the common weal is bound to exist in every man 
                of a certain degree of advancement. Possibly you are right too 
                - that action founded on material interest would be more desirable. 
                You are altogether, as the French say, too primesauti¨¨re a nature; 
                you must have intense, energetic action, or nothing.' </p>
              <p> Levin listened to his brother and did not understand a single 
                word, and did not want to understand. He was only afraid his brother 
                might ask him some question which would make it evident he had 
                not heard. </p>
              <p> `So that's what I think it is, my dear boy,' said Sergei Ivanovich, 
                touching him on the shoulder. </p>
              <p> `Yes, of course. But, do you know? I won't stand up for my view,' 
                answered Levin, with a guilty, childlike smile. `Whatever was 
                it I was disputing about?' he wondered. `Of course, I'm right, 
                and he's right, and it's all first-rate. Only I must go round 
                to the countinghouse and see to things.' He got up, stretching 
                and smiling. </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich smiled too. </p>
              <p> `If you want to go out, let's go together,' he said, disinclined 
                to be parted from his brother, who seemed positively breathing 
                out freshness and energy. `Come, we'll go to the countinghouse, 
                if you have to go there.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, heavens!' shouted Levin, so loudly that Sergei Ivanovich 
                was quite frightened. </p>
              <p> `What, what is the matter? </p>
              <p> `How's Agathya Mikhailovna's hand?' said Levin, slapping himself 
                on the head. `I'd positively forgotten her.' </p>
              <p> `It's much better.' </p>
              <p> `Well, anyway, I'll run down to her. Before you've time to get 
                your hat on, I'll be back.' </p>
              <p> And he ran downstairs, clattering with his heels like a spring 
                rattle. </p>

              <p align="center" class="h">Chapter 4</p>
              <p><br>
                There is really only one circle of Peterburg upper society: everyone 
                knows everyone else, even visits each other. But this great circle 
                has subdivisions of its own. Anna Arkadyevna Karenina had friends 
                and close ties in three different circles. One circle was her 
                husband's set of civil servants and officials, consisting of his 
                colleagues and subordinates, brought together in a most diversified 
                and capricious manner, yet separated by social conditions. Anna 
                could now recall only with difficulty the feeling of almost pious 
                reverence which she had at first borne for these persons. Now 
                she knew all of them, as people know one another in a provincial 
                town; she knew their habits and weaknesses, and where the shoe 
                pinched each one of them. She knew their attitudes toward one 
                another and to the chief center; knew who backed whom, and how 
                and wherewithal each one maintained his position, and who agreed 
                or disagreed with whom; but this circle of political, masculine 
                interests could not interest her, and, in spite of Countess Lidia 
                Ivanovna's suggestions, she avoided it. </p>
              <p>Another small circle, with which Anna was intimate, was the one 
                by means of which Alexei Alexandrovich had made his career. The 
                center of this circle was the Countess Lidia Ivanovna. This was 
                a circle of elderly, homely, virtuous and pious women, and clever, 
                learned and ambitious men. One of the clever people belonging 
                to this small circle had called it `the conscience of Peterburg 
                society.' Alexei Alexandrovich appreciated this circle very much, 
                and Anna, who knew so well how to get on with all, had in the 
                early days of her life in Peterburg found friends even in this 
                circle. But now, upon her return from Moscow, this set had become 
                unbearable to her. It seemed to her that both she and all of them 
                were dissimulating, and she experienced such boredom and lack 
                of ease in their society that she tried to visit the Countess 
                Lidia Ivanovna as infrequently as possible. </p>
              <p> And, finally, the third circle with which Anna had ties was 
                the really fashionable world - the world of balls, of dinners, 
                of sumptuous dresses; the world that hung on to the court with 
                one hand, in order not to sink to the level of the demimonde, 
                which the members of the fashionable world believed they despised 
                - yet the tastes of both were not only similar, but precisely 
                the same. Her connection with this circle was maintained through 
                Princess Betsy Tverskaia, her cousin's wife, who had an income 
                of a hundred and twenty thousand roubles, and who had taken a 
                great liking to Anna ever since she first came out, looking after 
                her and drawing her into her own circle, poking fun at that of 
                Countess Lidia Ivanovna. </p>
              <p> `When I'm old and shall have lost my looks, I'll be the same,' 
                Betsy used to say; `but for a young and pretty woman like you 
                it's much too early to join that Old Ladies' Home.' </p>
              <p> Anna had at first avoided, as much as she could, Princess Tverskaia's 
                world, because it necessitated expenditures above her means - 
                and, besides, at soul she preferred the first circle; but after 
                her trip to Moscow, things fell out quite the other way. She avoided 
                her moral friends, and went out into the fashionable world. There 
                she would meet Vronsky, and experienced an agitating joy at such 
                meetings. Especially often did she meet Vronsky at Betsy's, for 
                Betsy was a Vronsky by birth, and his cousin. Vronsky went everywhere 
                where he might meet Anna, and, at every chance he had, spoke to 
                her of his love. She offered him no encouragement, yet every time 
                she met him there was kindled in her soul that same feeling of 
                animation which had come upon her that day in the railway carriage 
                when she had seen him for the first time. She felt herself that 
                her delight shone in her eyes and puckered her lips into a smile 
                - and she could not quench the expression of this delight. </p>
              <p> At first Anna had sincerely believed that she was displeased 
                with him for daring to pursue her; but not long after her return 
                from Moscow, on arriving at a soiree where she had anticipated 
                meeting him, yet not finding him there, she realized clearly, 
                from the feeling of sadness which overcame her, that she had been 
                deceiving herself, and that this pursuit was not merely not distasteful 
                to her, but that it constituted all the interest of her life. 
              </p>
              <p> It was the second performance of a celebrated cantatrice, and 
                all the fashionable world was in the theater. Vronsky, seeing 
                his cousin from his seat in the front row, did not wait till the 
                entr'acte, but went to her box. </p>
              <p> `Why didn't you come to dinner?' she said to him. `I marvel 
                at this clairvoyance of lovers,' she added with a smile, so that 
                no one but he could hear, `she wasn't there. But do come after 
                the opera.' </p>
              <p> Vronsky looked inquiringly at her. She nodded. He thanked her 
                by a smile, and sat down beside her. </p>
              <p> `But how I remember your jeers!' continued Princess Betsy, who 
                took special delight in following up the progress of this passion. 
                `What's become of all that? You're caught, my dear fellow.' </p>
              <p> `That's my one desire - to be caught,' answered Vronsky, with 
                his calm, good-natured smile. `If I complain at all, it's only 
                that I'm not caught enough, if the truth were told. I begin to 
                lose hope.' </p>
              <p> `Why, whatever hope can you expect?' said Betsy, offended on 
                behalf of her friend. `Entendons nous....' But in her eyes flitted 
                gleams of light, which proclaimed that she understood very well, 
                even as much as he did, what hope he might entertain. </p>
              <p> `None whatever,' said Vronsky, laughing and showing his closely 
                set teeth. `Excuse me,' he added, taking the binoculars out of 
                her hand, and proceeding to scrutinize, over her bare shoulder, 
                the row of boxes opposite them. `I'm afraid I'm becoming ridiculous.' 
              </p>
              <p> He was very well aware that he ran no risk of being ridiculous 
                in the eyes of Betsy and all other fashionable people. He was 
                very well aware that in the eyes of these people the role of the 
                hapless lover of a girl, or in general, of any woman free to marry, 
                might be ridiculous; but the role of a man pursuing a married 
                woman, and, regardless of everything, staking his life on drawing 
                her into adultery - that role has something beautiful and majestic 
                about it, and can never be ridiculous, and so it was with a proud 
                and gay smile under his mustaches that he lowered the binoculars 
                and looked at his cousin. </p>
              <p> `But why didn't you come to dinner?' she said, admiring him. 
              </p>
              <p> `I must tell you about that. I was busy - and with what, do 
                you suppose? I'll give you a hundred guesses, a thousand... you'd 
                never guess. I've been reconciling a husband with a man who'd 
                insulted his wife. Yes, really!' </p>
              <p> `Well, did you reconcile them?' </p>
              <p> `Almost.' </p>
              <p> `You really must tell me about it,' she said, getting up. `Come 
                to me in the next entr'acte.' </p>
              <p> `I can't; I'm going to the French theater.' </p>
              <p> `Leaving Nilsson?' Betsy queried in horror, though she could 
                not herself have distinguished Nilsson from any chorus girl. </p>
              <p> `What can I do? I've an appointment there, all because of my 
                mission of peace.' </p>
              <p> `'Blessed are the peacemakers;'' ``they shall be saved',' said 
                Betsy, recalling something of that sort she had heard from somebody 
                or other. `Very well, then, sit down, and tell me what it's all 
                about.' </p>
              <p> And she resumed her seat. </p>
              <p> </p>

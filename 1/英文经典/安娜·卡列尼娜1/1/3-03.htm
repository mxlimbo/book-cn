                `Do you know I've been thinking about you,' said Sergei Ivanovich. 
                `It's beyond everything what's being done in the district, according 
                to what this doctor tells me. He's a very intelligent fellow. 
                And as I've told you before, I tell you again: it's not right 
                for you not to go to the meetings, and to keep out of the Zemstvo 
                affairs entirely. If decent people won't go into it, of course 
                it's bound to go all wrong. We pay the money, and it all goes 
                in salaries, and there are no schools, nor district dressers, 
                nor midwives, nor pharmacies - nothing.' </p>
              <p>`Well, I did try, you know,' Levin said gently and unwillingly. 
                `I can't! And so there's no help for it.' </p>
              <p> `But why can't you? I must own I can't make it out. Indifference, 
                incapacity - I won't admit; surely it's not simply laziness?' 
              </p>
              <p> `None of those things. I've tried, and I see I can do nothing,' 
                said Levin. </p>
              <p> He had hardly grasped what his brother was saying. Looking toward 
                the plowland across the river, he made out something black, but 
                he could not distinguish whether it was a horse or the bailiff 
                on horseback. </p>
              <p> `Why is it you can do nothing? You made an attempt and didn't 
                succeed, as you think, and you give in. How can you have so little 
                ambition?' </p>
              <p> `Ambition!' said Levin, stung to the quick by his brother's 
                words; `I don't understand. If they'd told me at college that 
                other people understood the integral calculus, and I didn't, then 
                ambition would have come in. But in this case one wants first 
                to be convinced that one has certain abilities for this sort of 
                business, and especially that all this business is of great importance.' 
              </p>
              <p> `What! Do you mean to say it's not of importance?' said Sergei 
                Ivanovich, stung to the quick in his turn by his brother's considering 
                of no importance anything that interested him, and still more 
                at his obviously paying little attention to what he was saying. 
              </p>
              <p> `I don't think it important; it does not take hold of me - I 
                can't help it,' answered Levin, making out that what he saw was 
                the bailiff, and that the bailiff seemed to be letting the peasants 
                go off the plowed land. They were turning the plow over. `Can 
                they have finished plowing?' he wondered. </p>
              <p> `Come, really though,' said the elder brother, with a frown 
                on his handsome, clever face, `there's a limit to everything. 
                It's very well to be original and genuine, and to dislike everything 
                hypocritical - I know all about that; but really, what you're 
                saying either has no meaning, or it has a very wrong meaning. 
                How can you think it a matter of no importance whether ``the people,' 
                whom you love as you assert...' </p>
              <p> `I never did assert it,' thought Konstantin Levin. </p>
              <p> `...die without help? The ignorant peasant women starve the 
                children, and the people stagnate in darkness, and are helpless 
                in the hands of every village clerk, while you have at your disposal 
                a means of helping them, and don't help them because to your mind 
                it's of no importance!' </p>
              <p> And Sergei Ivanovich put before him the dilemma: Either you 
                are so undeveloped that you can't see all that you can do, or 
                you won't sacrifice your ease, your vanity, or whatever it is, 
                to do it. </p>
              <p> Konstantin Levin felt that there was no course open to him but 
                to submit, or to confess to a lack of zeal for the public good. 
                And this mortified him and hurt his feelings. </p>
              <p> `It's both,' he said resolutely; `I don't see that it is possible...' 
              </p>
              <p> `What! Is it impossible, if the money were properly laid out, 
                to provide medical aid?' </p>
              <p> `Impossible, as it seems to me.... For the four thousand square 
                verstas of our district, what with our undersnow waters, and the 
                storms, and the work in the fields, I don't see how it is possible 
                to provide medical aid all over. And besides, I don't believe 
                in medicine.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, well, that's unfair.... I can quote to you thousands of 
                instances.... But the schools, at least?' </p>
              <p> `Why have schools?' </p>
              <p> `What do you mean? Can there be two opinions of the advantage 
                of education? If it's a good thing for you, it's a good thing 
                for everyone.' </p>
              <p> Konstantin Levin felt himself morally pinned against a wall, 
                and so he became heated, and unconsciously blurted out the chief 
                cause of his indifference to public business. </p>
              <p> `Perhaps it may all be very good; but why should I worry myself 
                about establishing dispensaries which I shall never make use of, 
                and schools to which I shall never send my children, to which 
                even the peasants don't want to send their children, and to which 
                I've no very firm faith that they ought to send them?' said he. 
              </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich was for a minute surprised at this unexpected 
                view of the subject; but he promptly made a new plan of attack. 
              </p>
              <p> He was silent for a little, drew out a hook, threw it in again, 
                and turned to his brother smiling. </p>
              <p> `Come, now.... In the first place, the dispensary is needed. 
                We ourselves sent for the district doctor for Agathya Mikhailovna.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, well, but I fancy her wrist will never be straight again.' 
              </p>
              <p> `That remains to be proved.... Next, the peasant who can read 
                and write is as a workman of more use and value to you.' </p>
              <p> `No; you can ask anyone you like,' Konstantin Levin answered 
                with decision, `the man that can read and write is much inferior 
                as a workman. And mending the highroads is an impossibility; and 
                as soon as they put up bridges they're stolen.' </p>
              <p> `Still, that's not the point,' said Sergei Ivanovich, frowning. 
                He disliked contradiction, and still more, arguments that were 
                continually skipping from one thing to another, introducing new 
                and disconnected points, so that there was no knowing to which 
                to reply. `Let me say. Do you admit that education is a benefit 
                for the people?' </p>
              <p> `Yes, I admit it,' said Levin without thinking, and he was conscious 
                immediately that he had said what he did not think. He felt that 
                if he admitted that, it would be proved that he had been talking 
                meaningless rubbish. How it would be proved he could not tell, 
                but he knew that this would inevitably be logically proved to 
                him, and he awaited the proofs. </p>
              <p> The argument turned out to be far simpler than Konstantin Levin 
                had expected. </p>
              <p> `If you admit that it is a benefit,' said Sergei Ivanovich, 
                `then, as an honest man, you cannot help caring about it and sympathizing 
                with the movement, and so wishing to work for it.' </p>
              <p> `But I still do not admit this movement to be good,' said Konstantin 
                Levin, reddening. </p>
              <p> `What! But you just said now...' </p>
              <p> `That's to say, I don't admit it's being either good or possible.' 
              </p>
              <p> `That you can't tell without making the trial.' </p>
              <p> `Well, supposing that is so,' said Levin, though he did not 
                suppose so at all, `supposing that is so, still I don't see, all 
                the same, why I should worry myself about it.' </p>
              <p> `How so?' </p>
              <p> `No; since we are talking, explain it to me from the philosophical 
                point of view,' said Levin. </p>
              <p> `I can't see where philosophy comes in,' said Sergei Ivanovich, 
                in a tone, Levin fancied, as though he did not admit his brother's 
                right to talk about philosophy. And that irritated Levin. </p>
              <p> `I'll tell you, then,' he said with heat, `I imagine the mainspring 
                of all our actions is, after all, self-interest. Now in the Zemstvo 
                institutions I, as a nobleman, see nothing that could conduce 
                to my prosperity. The roads are not better and could not be better; 
                my horses carry me well enough over bad ones. Doctors and dispensaries 
                are of no use to me. A justice of the peace is of no use to me 
                - I never appeal to him, and never shall appeal to him. The schools 
                are of no good to me, but positively harmful, as I told you. For 
                me the Zemstvo institutions simply mean the liability of paying 
                eighteen kopecks for every dessiatina, of driving into the town, 
                sleeping with bedbugs, and listening to all sorts of idiocy and 
                blather, and self-interest offers me no inducement.' </p>
              <p> `Excuse me,' Sergei Ivanovich interposed with a smile, `self-interest 
                did not induce us to work for the emancipation of the serfs, yet 
                we did work for it.' </p>
              <p> `No!' Konstantin Levin broke in with still greater heat; `the 
                emancipation of the serfs was a different matter. There self-interest 
                did come in. One longed to throw off that yoke that crushed us 
                - all the decent people among us. But to be a member of the Zemstvo 
                and discuss how many street cleaners are needed, and how sewers 
                shall be constructed in the town in which I don't live - to serve 
                on a jury and try a peasant who has stolen a flitch of bacon, 
                and listen for six hours at a stretch to all sorts of jabber from 
                the counsel for the defense and the prosecution, and the president 
                cross-examining my old simpleton Alioshka: ``Do you admit, prisoner 
                at the bar, the fact of the removal of the bacon' - ``Eh?'' </p>
              <p> Konstantin Levin had warmed to his subject, and began mimicking 
                the president and the half-witted Alioshka: it seemed to him that 
                it was all to the point. </p>
              <p> But Sergei Ivanovich shrugged his shoulders. </p>
              <p> `Well, what do you mean to say, then?' </p>
              <p> `I simply mean to say that those rights that touch me... my 
                interest, I shall always defend to the best of my ability; that 
                when raids were made on us students, and the police read our letters, 
                I was ready to defend those rights to the utmost, to defend my 
                rights to education and freedom. I can understand compulsory military 
                service, which affects my children, my brothers, and myself - 
                I am ready to deliberate on what concerns me; but deliberating 
                on how to spend forty thousand roubles of Zemstvo's money, or 
                judging the half-witted Alioshka - that I don't understand, and 
                I can't do it.' </p>
              <p> Konstantin Levin spoke as though the floodgates of his speech 
                had burst open. Sergei Ivanovich smiled. </p>
              <p> `But tomorrow it'll be your turn to be tried; would it have 
                suited your tastes better to be tried in the old criminal court?' 
              </p>
              <p> `I'm not going to be tried. I shan't murder anybody, and I've 
                no need of it. Well, I tell you what,' he went on, flying off 
                again to a subject quite beside the point, `our district self-government 
                and all the rest of it - it's just like the birch saplings we 
                stick in the ground, as we would do it on Trinity Day, to look 
                like a copse which has grown up of itself in Europe, and I can't 
                gush over these birch saplings and believe in them.' </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich merely shrugged his shoulders, as though to 
                express his wonder how the birch saplings had come into their 
                argument at that point, though he did really understand at once 
                what his brother meant. </p>
              <p> `Excuse me, but you know one really can't argue in that way,' 
                he observed. </p>
              <p> But Konstantin Levin wanted to justify himself for the failing, 
                of which he was conscious, of a lack of zeal for the public welfare, 
                and he went on. </p>
              <p> `I imagine,' Konstantin said, `that no sort of activity is likely 
                to be lasting if it is not founded on self-interest - that's a 
                universal principle, a philosophical principle,' he said, repeating 
                the word `philosophical' with determination, as though wishing 
                to show that he had as much right as anyone else to talk of philosophy. 
              </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich smiled. `He too has a philosophy of his own 
                at the service of his natural tendencies,' he thought. </p>
              <p> `Come, you'd better let philosophy alone,' he said. `The chief 
                problem of the philosophy of all ages consists precisely in finding 
                that indispensable connection which exists between individual 
                and social interests. But that's not to the point; what is to 
                the point is a correction I must make in your comparison. The 
                birches are not simply stuck in, but some are sown and some are 
                planted, and one must deal carefully with them. It's only those 
                peoples that have an intuitive sense of what's of importance and 
                significance in their institutions, and know how to value them, 
                who have a future before them - it's only those peoples that one 
                can truly call historical.' </p>
              <p> And Sergei Ivanovich carried the subject into the regions of 
                philosophical history where Konstantin Levin could not follow 
                him, and showed him all the incorrectness of his outlook. </p>
              <p> `As for your dislike of it - excuse my saying so - that's simply 
                our Russian sloth and old serfowners' ways, and I'm convinced 
                that in you it's a temporary error and will pass.' </p>
              <p> Konstantin was silent. He felt himself vanquished on all sides, 
                but he felt at the same time that what he wanted to say was unintelligible 
                to his brother. Only he could not make up his mind whether it 
                was unintelligible because he was not capable of expressing his 
                meaning clearly, or because his brother would not or could not 
                understand him. But he did not pursue the speculation, and, without 
                replying, he fell to musing on a quite different and personal

                `You met him?' she asked, when they had sat down at the table 
                in the lamplight. `You're punished, you see, for being late.' 
              </p>
              <p>`Yes; but how was it? Wasn't he to be at the Council?' </p>
              <p> `He had been and come back, and was going out somewhere again. 
                But that doesn't matter. Don't talk about it. Where have you been? 
                With the Prince still?' </p>
              <p> She knew every detail of his existence. He was going to say 
                that he had been up all night and had dropped asleep, but looking 
                at her thrilled and rapturous face, he was ashamed. And he said 
                he had had to report on the Prince's departure. </p>
              <p> `But it's over now? He is gone?' </p>
              <p> `Thank God it's over! You wouldn't believe how insufferable 
                it's been for me.' </p>
              <p> `Why so? Isn't it the life all of you - all young men - always 
                lead?' she said, knitting her brows; and, taking up the crochet 
                work that was lying on the table, she began drawing the hook out 
                of it, without looking at Vronsky. </p>
              <p> `I gave that life up long ago,' said he, wondering at the change 
                in her face, and trying to divine its meaning. `And I confess,' 
                he said, with a smile, showing his thick, white teeth, `this week 
                I've been, as it were, looking at myself in a glass, seeing that 
                life, and I didn't like it.' </p>
              <p> She held the work in her hands, but did not crochet, and looked 
                at him with strange, shining, and hostile eyes. </p>
              <p> `This morning Liza came to see me - they're not afraid to call 
                on me, in spite of the Countess Lidia Ivanovna,' she put in - 
                `and she told me about your Athenian evening. How loathsome!' 
              </p>
              <p> `I was just going to say...' </p>
              <p> She interrupted him. </p>
              <p> `It was that Th¨¦r¨¨se you used to know?' </p>
              <p> `I was just saying...' </p>
              <p> `How disgusting you are, you men! How is it you can't understand 
                that a woman can never forget that,' she said, getting more and 
                more angry, and so letting him see the cause of her irritation, 
                `especially a woman who cannot know your life? What do I know? 
                What have I ever known?' she said. `Only what you tell me. And 
                how do I know whether you tell me the truth?...' </p>
              <p> `Anna, you hurt me. Don't you trust me? Haven't I told you that 
                I haven't a thought I wouldn't lay bare to you?' </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes,' she said, evidently trying to suppress her jealous 
                thoughts. `But if only you knew how wretched I am! I believe you, 
                I believe you.... What were you saying?' </p>
              <p> But he could not at once recall what he had been going to say. 
                These fits of jealousy, which of late had been more and more frequent 
                with her, horrified him, and however much he tried to disguise 
                the fact, made him feel cold to her, although he knew the cause 
                of her jealousy was her love for him. How often he had told himself 
                that her love was happiness; and now she loved him as a woman 
                can love when love has outweighed for her all the good things 
                of life - and he was much further from happiness than when he 
                had followed her from Moscow. Then he had thought himself unhappy, 
                but happiness was before him; now he felt that the best happiness 
                was already left behind. She was utterly unlike what she had been 
                when he first saw her. Both morally and physically she had changed 
                for the worse. She had broadened out all over, and in her face 
                at the time when she was speaking of the actress there was an 
                evil expression of hatred that distorted it. He looked at her 
                as a man looks at a faded flower he has gathered, with difficulty 
                recognizing in it the beauty for which he picked and ruined it. 
                And in spite of this he felt that then, when his love was stronger, 
                he could, if he had greatly wished it, have torn that love out 
                of his heart; but now when, as at this moment it seemed to him 
                he felt no love for her, he knew that his bond with her could 
                not be broken. </p>
              <p> `Well, well, what was it you were going to say about the Prince? 
                I have driven away the fiend, I have,' she added. The fiend was 
                the name they had given her jealousy. `What did you begin to tell 
                me about the Prince? Why did you find it so tiresome?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, it was intolerable!' he said, trying to pick up the thread 
                of his interrupted thought. `He does not improve on closer acquaintance. 
                If you want him defined, here he is: a prime, well-fed animal, 
                such as takes medals at the cattle shows, and nothing more,' he 
                said, with a tone of vexation that interested her. </p>
              <p> `No; how so?' she replied. `He's seen a great deal, anyway; 
                he's cultured?' </p>
              <p> `It's an utterly different culture - their culture. He's cultivated, 
                one sees, simply to be able to despise culture, as they despise 
                everything but animal pleasures.' </p>
              <p> `But don't you all care for these animal pleasures?' she said, 
                and again he noticed a dark look in her eyes that avoided him. 
              </p>
              <p> `How is it you're defending him?' he said, smiling. </p>
              <p> `I'm not defending him, it's nothing to me; but I imagine, if 
                you had not cared for those pleasures yourself, you might have 
                got out of them. But it affords you satisfaction to gaze at Th¨¦r¨¨se 
                in the attire of Eve...' </p>
              <p> `Again - again the devil,' Vronsky said, taking the hand she 
                had laid on the table and kissing it. </p>
              <p> `Yes; but I can't help it. You don't know what I have suffered 
                waiting for you. I believe I'm not jealous. I'm not jealous: I 
                believe you when you're here, near me; but when you're away somewhere 
                leading your life alone, so incomprehensible to me...' </p>
              <p> She turned away from him, pulled the hook at last out of the 
                crochet work, and rapidly with the help of her forefinger, began 
                working loop after loop of the wool that was dazzlingly white 
                in the lamplight, while the slender wrist moved swiftly, nervously 
                in its embroidered cuff. </p>
              <p> `How was it, then? Where did you meet Alexei Alexandrovich?' 
                Her voice sounded in an unnatural and jarring tone. </p>
              <p> `We ran against each other in the doorway.' </p>
              <p> `And he bowed to you like this?' </p>
              <p> She drew a long face, and half-closing her eyes, quickly transformed 
                her expression, folded her hands, and Vronsky suddenly saw in 
                her beautiful face the very expression with which Alexei Alexandrovich 
                had bowed to him. He smiled, while she laughed gaily, with that 
                sweet, deep laugh, which was one of her greatest charms. </p>
              <p> `I don't understand him in the least,' said Vronsky. `If after 
                your avowal to him at your summer villa he had broken with you, 
                if he had challenged me... But this I can't understand. How can 
                he put up with such a position? He feels it, that's evident.' 
              </p>
              <p> `He?' she said sneeringly. `He's perfectly satisfied.' </p>
              <p> `What are we all miserable for, when everything might be so 
                well?' </p>
              <p> `Except for him. Don't I know him - the falsity in which he's 
                utterly steeped?... Could one, with any feeling, live as he is 
                living with me? He understands nothing, and feels nothing. Could 
                a man of any feeling live in the same house with his unfaithful 
                wife? Could he talk to her, call her ``my dear'?' </p>
              <p> And again she could not help mimicking him: `Anna, ma ch¨¨re; 
                Anna, dear!' </p>
              <p> `He's not a man, not a human being - he's a mannikin! No one 
                knows him; but I know him. Oh, if I'd been in his place, I'd long 
                ago have killed, have torn to pieces a wife like me. I wouldn't 
                have said, ``Anna, ma ch¨¨re'! He's not a man, he's a ministerial 
                machine. He doesn't understand that I'm your wife, that he's outside, 
                that he's superfluous.... Don't let's talk of him!...' </p>
              <p> `You're unfair, very unfair, dearest,' said Vronsky, trying 
                to soothe her. `But never mind, don't let's talk of him. Tell 
                me what you've been doing. What is the matter? Why are you unwell, 
                and what did the doctor say?' </p>
              <p> She looked at him with mocking amusement. Evidently she had 
                hit on other absurd and grotesque aspects in her husband and was 
                awaiting the moment to give expression to them. </p>
              <p> But he went on: </p>
              <p> `I imagine that it's not illness, but your condition. When will 
                it be?' </p>
              <p> The ironical light died away in her eyes, but a different smile, 
                a consciousness of something, he did not know what, and of quiet 
                melancholy, came over her face. </p>
              <p> `Soon, soon. You say that our position is miserable, that we 
                must put an end to it. If you knew how terrible it is to me - 
                what I would give to be able to love you freely and unafraid! 
                I should not torture myself and torture you with my jealousy.... 
                And it will come soon, but not as we expect.' </p>
              <p> And at the thought of how it would come, she seemed so pitiable 
                to herself that tears came into her eyes, and she could not go 
                on. She laid on his sleeve her hand, shining with its whiteness 
                and its rings in the lamplight. </p>
              <p> `It won't come as we suppose. I didn't mean to say this to you, 
                but you've made me. Soon, soon, all will be over, and we shall 
                all, all be at peace, and suffer no more.' </p>
              <p> `I don't understand,' he said, understanding her. </p>
              <p> `You asked when? Soon. And I shan't live through it. Don't interrupt 
                me!' and she made haste to speak. `I know it; I know for certain. 
                I shall die; and I'm very glad I shall die, and release myself 
                and you.' </p>
              <p> Tears dropped from her eyes; he bent down over her hand and 
                began kissing it, trying to hide his emotion, which, he knew, 
                had no sort of grounds, though he could not control it. </p>
              <p> `Yes, it's better so,' she said, tightly gripping his hand. 
                `That's the only way - the only way left us.' </p>
              <p> He had recovered himself, and lifted his head. </p>
              <p> `How absurd! What absurd nonsense you are talking!' </p>
              <p> `No, it's the truth.' </p>
              <p> `What - what's the truth?' </p>
              <p> `That I shall die. I have had a dream.' </p>
              <p> `A dream?' repeated Vronsky, and instantly he recalled the peasant 
                of his dream. </p>
              <p> `Yes, a dream,' she said. `It's a long while since I dreamed 
                it. I dreamed that I ran into my bedroom, that I had to get something 
                there, to find out something; you know how it is in dreams,' she 
                said, her eyes wide with horror; `and in the bedroom, in the corner, 
                stood something.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, what nonsense! How can you believe...' </p>
              <p> But she would not let him interrupt her. What she was saying 
                was too important to her. </p>
              <p> `And the something turned round, and I saw it was a peasant 
                with a disheveled beard - a little man, and dreadful. I wanted 
                to run away, but he bent down over a sack, and was fumbling there 
                with his hands...' </p>
              <p> She showed how he had moved his hands. There was terror in her 
                face. And Vronsky, remembering his dream, felt the same terror 
                filling his soul. </p>
              <p> `He was fumbling and kept talking quickly, quickly in French, 
                and, you know, he burred: Il faut le battre, le fer, le broyer, 
                le p¨¦trir.... And in my horror I tried to wake up, and woke up... 
                but woke up in the dream. And I began asking myself what it meant. 
                And Kornei said to me: ``In childbirth you'll die, ma'am, you'll 
                die....' And I woke up.' </p>
              <p> `What nonsense, what nonsense!' said Vronsky; but he felt himself 
                that there was no conviction in his voice. </p>
              <p> `But don't let's talk of it. Ring the bell, I'll have tea. And 
                stay a little, now; it's not long I shall...' </p>
              <p> But all at once she stopped. The expression of her face instantaneously 
                changed. Horror and excitement were suddenly replaced by a look 
                of soft, solemn, blissful attention. He could not comprehend the 
                meaning of the change. She was listening to the stirring of the 
                new life within her. </p>

              <p><br>
                The mistake made by Alexei Alexandrovich, when preparing to see 
                his wife, in having overlooked the possibility that her repentance 
                might be sincere, and that he might forgive her, and she might 
                not die - this mistake was two months after his return from Moscow 
                brought home to him in all its significance. But the mistake made 
                by him had arisen not simply from his having overlooked that contingency, 
                but also from the fact that, until the day of his interview with 
                his dying wife, he had not known his own heart. At his sick wife's 
                bedside he had for the first time in his life given way to that 
                feeling of sympathetic suffering always roused in him by the sufferings 
                of others, and hitherto looked on by him with shame as a harmful 
                weakness. And pity for her, and remorse for having desired her 
                death, and, most of all, the joy of forgiveness, made him at once 
                conscious, not simply of the relief of his own sufferings, but 
                of a spiritual peace he had never experienced before. He suddenly 
                felt that the very thing that was the source of his sufferings 
                had become the source of his spiritual joy; that what had seemed 
                insolvable while he was judging, blaming, and hating, had become 
                clear and simple when he forgave and loved. <br>
                He forgave his wife and pitied her for her sufferings and her 
                remorse. He forgave Vronsky, and pitied him, especially after 
                reports reached him of his despairing action. He felt more for 
                his son than before. And he blamed himself now for having taken 
                too little interest in him. But for the little newborn baby he 
                felt a quite peculiar sentiment, not of pity only, but of tenderness. 
                At first, from a feeling of compassion alone, he had been interested 
                in the delicate little creature, who was not his child, and who 
                was neglected during her mother's illness, and would certainly 
                have died if he had not troubled about her; and he did not himself 
                observe how fond he became of her. He would go into the nursery 
                several times a day, and sit there for a long while, so that the 
                nurse and wet nurses, who were at first afraid of him, got quite 
                used to his presence. Sometimes, for half an hour at a stretch, 
                he would sit silently gazing at the saffron-red, downy, wrinkled 
                face of the sleeping baby, watching the movements of the frowning 
                brows, and the plump little hands with clenched fingers, that 
                rubbed the little eyes and bridge of the nose with the back of 
                their palms. At such moments particularly Alexei Alexandrovich 
                had a sense of perfect peace and inward harmony, and saw nothing 
                extraordinary in his position, nothing that ought to be changed. 
              </p>
              <p> But, as time went on, he saw more and more distinctly that however 
                natural the position now seemed to him, he would not long be allowed 
                to remain in it. He felt that besides the blessed spiritual force 
                controlling his soul, there was another, a brutal force, as powerful, 
                or more powerful, which controlled his life, and that this force 
                would not allow him that humble peace he longed for. He felt that 
                everyone was looking at him with inquiring wonder, that he was 
                not understood, and that something was expected of him. Above 
                all, he felt the instability and unnaturalness of his relations 
                with his wife. </p>
              <p> When the softening effect of the near approach of death had 
                passed away, Alexei Alexandrovich began to notice that Anna was 
                afraid of him, ill at ease with him, and could not look him straight 
                in the face. She seemed to be wanting, yet not daring, to tell 
                him something; and, as though foreseeing that their present relations 
                could not continue, she seemed to be expecting something from 
                him. </p>
              <p> Toward the end of February Anna's baby daughter, who had also 
                been named Anna, happened to fall ill. Alexei Alexandrovich was 
                in the nursery in the morning, and leaving orders for the doctor 
                to be sent for, he went to his office. On finishing his work, 
                he returned home at four. Going into the hall he saw a handsome 
                footman, in a gallooned livery and a bear-fur cape, holding a 
                white fur cloak. </p>
              <p> `Who is here?' asked Alexei Alexandrovich. </p>
              <p> `Princess Elizaveta Fiodorovna Tverskaia,' the footman answered, 
                and it seemed to Alexei Alexandrovich that the fellow grinned. 
              </p>
              <p> During all this difficult time Alexei Alexandrovich had noticed 
                that his worldly acquaintances, especially women, took a peculiar 
                interest in him and his wife. He observed all these acquaintances 
                with difficulty concealing their mirth at something - the same 
                mirth that he had perceived in the lawyer's eyes, and, just now, 
                in the eyes of this footman. Everyone seemed, somehow, hugely 
                delighted, as though just come from a wedding. When they met him, 
                they inquired with ill-disguised enjoyment after his wife's health. 
              </p>
              <p> The presence of Princess Tverskaia was unpleasant to Alexei 
                Alexandrovich from the memories associated with her, and also 
                because he disliked her, and he went straight to the nursery. 
                In the day nursery Seriozha, leaning on the table with his legs 
                on a chair, was drawing and chatting away merrily. The English 
                governess, who had during Anna's illness replaced the French one, 
                was sitting near the boy, knitting mignardise. She hurriedly got 
                up, curtsied, and pulled Seriozha. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich stroked his son's hair, answered the governess's 
                inquiries about his wife, and asked what the doctor had said of 
                the baby. </p>
              <p> `The doctor said it was nothing serious, and he ordered a bath, 
                sir.' </p>
              <p> `But she is still in pain,' said Alexei Alexandrovich, listening 
                to the baby's screaming in the next room. </p>
              <p> `I think it's the wet nurse, sir,' the Englishwoman said firmly. 
              </p>
              <p> `What makes you think so?' he asked, stopping short. </p>
              <p> `It's just as it was at Countess Paul's, sir. They gave the 
                baby medicine, and it turned out that the baby was simply hungry: 
                the wet nurse had no milk, sir.' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich pondered, and after standing still a few 
                seconds he went in at the other door. The baby was lying with 
                its head thrown back, stiffening itself in the nurse's arms, and 
                would not take the plump breast offered it; and it never ceased 
                screaming in spite of the double hushing of the wet nurse and 
                the other nurse, who was bending over her. </p>
              <p> `Still no better?' said Alexei Alexandrovich. </p>
              <p> `She's very restless,' answered the nurse in a whisper. </p>
              <p> `Miss Edwards says that perhaps the wet nurse has no milk,' 
                he said. </p>
              <p> `I think so too, Alexei Alexandrovich.' </p>
              <p> `Then why didn't you say so?' </p>
              <p> `Who's one to say it to? Anna Arkadyevna is still ill...' said 
                the nurse discontentedly. </p>
              <p> The nurse was an old servant of the family. And in her simple 
                words there seemed to Alexei Alexandrovich an allusion to his 
                position. </p>
              <p> The baby screamed louder than ever, struggling and choking. 
                The nurse, with a gesture of despair, went to it, took it from 
                the wet nurse's arms, and began walking up and down, rocking it. 
              </p>
              <p> `You must ask the doctor to examine the wet nurse,' said Alexei 
                Alexandrovich. </p>
              <p> The smartly dressed and healthy-looking nurse, frightened at 
                the idea of losing her place, muttered something to herself, and, 
                covering her bosom, smiled contemptuously at the idea of doubts 
                being cast on her abundance of milk. In that smile, too, Alexei 
                Alexandrovich saw a sneer at his position. </p>
              <p> `Luckless child,' said the nurse, hushing the baby, and still 
                walking up and down with it. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich sat down, and with a despondent and suffering 
                face watched the nurse walking to and fro. </p>
              <p> When the child at last was still, and had been put in a deep 
                bed, and the nurse, after smoothing the little pillow, had left 
                her, Alexei Alexandrovich got up, and, walking awkwardly on tiptoe, 
                approached the baby. For a minute he was still, and with the same 
                despondent face gazed at the baby; but all at once a smile that 
                moved his hair and the skin of his forehead, came out on his face, 
                and he went as softly out of the room. </p>
              <p> In the dining room he rang the bell, and told the servant who 
                came in to send again for the doctor. He felt vexed with his wife 
                for not being anxious about this charming baby, and in this vexed 
                humor he had no wish to go to her; he had no wish, either, to 
                see Princess Betsy. But his wife might wonder why he did not go 
                to her as usual; and so, overcoming his disinclination, he went 
                toward her bedroom. As he walked over the soft rug toward the 
                door, he could not help overhearing a conversation he did not 
                want to hear. </p>
              <p> `If he hadn't been going away, I could have understood your 
                refusal and his too. But your husband ought to be above that,' 
                Betsy was saying. </p>
              <p> `It's not for my husband - it's for myself I don't wish it. 
                Don't say that!' answered Anna's excited voice. </p>
              <p> `Yes, but you must care to say good-by to a man who has shot 
                himself on your account....' </p>
              <p> `That's just why I don't want to.' </p>
              <p> With a dismayed and guilty expression, Alexei Alexandrovich 
                stopped and would have gone back unobserved. But reflecting that 
                this would be undignified, he turned back again, and, clearing 
                his throat, he approached the bedroom. The voices were silent, 
                and he went in. </p>
              <p> Anna, in a gray dressing gown, with a crop of short clustering 
                black curls on her round head, was sitting on a settee. The animation 
                died out of her face, as it always did, at the sight of her husband; 
                she dropped her head and looked round uneasily at Betsy. Betsy, 
                dressed in the height of the latest fashion, in a hat that towered 
                over her head like a shade on a lamp, in a dove-colored dress 
                with crude oblique stripes, slanting one way on the bodice and 
                the other way on the skirt, was sitting beside Anna, her tall 
                flat figure held erect. Bowing her head, she greeted Alexei Alexandrovich 
                with an ironical smile. </p>
              <p> `Ah!' she said, as though surprised. `I'm very glad you're at 
                home. You never put in an appearance anywhere, and I haven't seen 
                you ever since Anna has been ill. I have heard all about it - 
                your anxiety. Yes, you're a wonderful husband!' she said, with 
                a significant and affable air, as though she were bestowing an 
                order of magnanimity on him for his conduct toward his wife. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich bowed frigidly, and, kissing his wife's 
                hand, asked how she was. </p>
              <p> `Better, I think,' she said, avoiding his eyes. </p>
              <p> `But you've rather a feverish complexion,' he said, laying stress 
                on the word `feverish.' </p>
              <p> `We've been talking too much,' said Betsy. `I feel it's selfishness 
                on my part, and I am going away.' </p>
              <p> She got up, but Anna, suddenly flushing, quickly caught at her 
                hand. </p>
              <p> `No, wait a minute, please. I must tell you... no, I mean you,' 
                she turned to Alexei Alexandrovich, and her neck and brow were 
                suffused with crimson. `I won't and can't keep anything secret 
                from you,' she said. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich cracked his fingers and bowed his head. 
              </p>
              <p> `Betsy's been telling me that Count Vronsky wants to come here 
                to say good-by before his departure for Tashkend.' She did not 
                look at her husband, and was evidently in haste to have everything 
                out, however hard it might be for her. `I told her I could not 
                receive him.' </p>
              <p> `You said, my dear, that it would depend on Alexei Alexandrovich,' 
                Betsy corrected her. </p>
              <p> `Oh, no, I can't receive him; and what object would there be 
                in...' She stopped suddenly, and glanced inquiringly at her husband 
                (he did not look at her). `In short, I don't wish it....' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich advanced and would have taken her hand. 
              </p>
              <p> Her first impulse was to jerk back her hand from the damp hand 
                with big swollen veins that sought hers, but with an obvious effort 
                to control herself she pressed his hand. </p>
              <p> `I am very grateful to you for your confidence, but...' he said, 
                feeling with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide 
                easily and clearly by himself, he could not discuss before Princess 
                Tverskaia, who to him stood for the incarnation of that brute 
                force which would inevitably control him in the life he led in 
                the eyes of the world, and hinder him from giving way to his feeling 
                of love and forgiveness. He stopped short, looking at Princess 
                Tverskaia. </p>
              <p> `Well, good-by, my darling,' said Betsy, getting up. She kissed 
                Anna, and went out. Alexei Alexandrovich escorted her out. </p>
              <p> `Alexei Alexandrovich! I know you are a truly magnanimous man,' 
                said Betsy, stopping in the little drawing room, and with special 
                warmth shaking hands with him once more. `I am an outsider, but 
                I love her so, and respect you, that I venture to advise. Receive 
                him. Alexei Vronsky is the soul of honor, and he is going away 
                to Tashkend.' </p>
              <p> `Thank you, Princess, for your sympathy and advice. But the 
                question of whether my wife can or cannot see anyone she must 
                decide herself.' </p>
              <p> He said this from habit, lifting his brows with dignity, and 
                reflected immediately that whatever his words might be, there

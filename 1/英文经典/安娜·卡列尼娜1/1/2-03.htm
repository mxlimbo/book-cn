              <p><br>
                When she went into Kitty's little sanctum, a pretty, rosy little 
                room, full of knickknacks in vieux saxe, as youthful and rosy 
                and gay as Kitty herself had been only two months ago, Dolly recalled 
                how they had together decorated the room the year before, with 
                what gaiety and love. Her heart turned cold when she beheld Kitty 
                sitting on the low chair nearest the door, her eyes fixed immovably 
                on a corner of the rug. Kitty glanced at her sister, and the cold, 
                rather austere expression of her face did not change. </p>
              <p>`I'm going now, and shall entrench myself at home, and you won't 
                be able to come to see me,' said Darya Alexandrovna sitting down 
                beside her. `I want to talk to you.' </p>
              <p> `What about?' Kitty asked swiftly, lifting her head in fright. 
              </p>
              <p> `What should it be, save what's grieving you?' </p>
              <p> `I have no grief.' </p>
              <p> `Come, Kitty. Do you possibly think I cannot know? I know all. 
                And, believe me, this is so insignificant... We've all been through 
                it.' </p>
              <p> Kitty did not speak, and her face had a stern expression. </p>
              <p> `He's not worth your suffering on his account,' pursued Darya 
                Alexandrovna, coming straight to the point. </p>
              <p> `Yes - because he has disdained me,' said Kitty, in a jarring 
                voice. `Don't say anything! Please, don't say anything!' </p>
              <p> `But whoever told you that? No one has said that. I'm certain 
                he was in love with you, and remained in love with you, but...' 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, the most awful thing of all for me are these condolences!' 
                cried out Kitty, in a sudden fit of anger. She turned round on 
                her chair, turned red, and her fingers moved quickly, as she pinched 
                the buckle of the belt she held, now with one hand, now with the 
                other. Dolly knew this trick her sister had of grasping something 
                in turn with each of her hands, when in excitement; she knew that, 
                in a moment of excitement Kitty was capable of forgetting herself 
                and saying a great deal too much and much that was unpleasant, 
                and Dolly would have calmed her; but it was already too late. 
              </p>
              <p> `What - what is it you want to make me feel, eh?' said Kitty 
                quickly. `That I've been in love with a man who didn't even care 
                to know me, and that I'm dying for love of him? And this is said 
                to me by my own sister, who imagines that... that... that she's 
                sympathizing with me!... I don't want these condolences and hypocrisies!' 
              </p>
              <p> `Kitty, you're unjust.' </p>
              <p> `Why do you torment me?' </p>
              <p> `But I... On the contrary... I can see you're hurt....' </p>
              <p> But Kitty in her heat did not hear her. </p>
              <p> `I've nothing to despair over and be comforted about. I'm sufficiently 
                proud never to allow myself to care for a man who does not love 
                me.' </p>
              <p> `Why, I don't say anything of the kind... Only, tell me the 
                truth,' said Darya Alexandrovna, taking her by the hand, `tell 
                me - did Levin speak to you?...' </p>
              <p> The mention of Levin seemed to deprive Kitty of the last vestige 
                of self-control. She leaped up from her chair, and, flinging the 
                buckle to the ground, gesticulating rapidly with her hands, she 
                said: </p>
              <p> `Why bring Levin in too? I can't understand - what you want 
                to torture me for? I've told you, and I repeat it - I have some 
                pride, and never, never would I do what you're doing - going back 
                to a man who's deceived you, who has come to love another woman. 
                I can't understand this! You may - but I can't do it!' </p>
              <p> And, having said these words, she glanced at her sister, and 
                seeing that Dolly sat silent, her head mournfully bowed, Kitty, 
                instead of leaving the room, as she had intended, sat down near 
                the door, and, hiding her face in her shawl, let her head drop. 
              </p>
              <p> The silence lasted for two minutes. Dolly's thoughts were of 
                herself. That humiliation of which she was always conscious came 
                back to her with special pain when her sister reminded her of 
                it. She had not expected such cruelty from her sister, and was 
                resentful. But suddenly she heard the rustle of a skirt, and, 
                simultaneously, an outburst of smothered sobbing, and felt arms 
                clasping her neck from below. Kitty was on her knees before her. 
              </p>
              <p> `Dolinka, I am so, so unhappy!' she whispered penitently. </p>
              <p> And the endearing face, covered with tears, hid itself in Darya 
                Alexandrovna's skirt. </p>
              <p> It was as if tears were the indispensable oil without which 
                the machinery of mutual communion could not run smoothly between 
                the two sisters; the sisters, after their tears, discussed everything 
                but that which engrossed them; but, even in talking of outside 
                matters, they understood one another. Kitty knew that what she 
                had uttered in anger about her husband's infidelity and her humiliating 
                position had struck her poor sister to the very depths of her 
                heart, but she also knew that the latter had forgiven her. Dolly 
                for her part had comprehended all she had wanted to find out. 
                She had become convinced that her surmises were correct; that 
                Kitty's misery, her incurable misery, was due precisely to the 
                fact that Levin had proposed to her and she had refused him, while 
                Vronsky had deceived her, and that she stood ready to love Levin 
                and to hate Vronsky. Kitty said no word of this; she spoke of 
                nothing save her own spiritual state. </p>
              <p> `I have nothing to grieve over,' she said, calming down, `but 
                you could understand that everything has become loathsome, hateful, 
                coarse to me - and I myself most of all. You can't imagine what 
                loathsome thoughts I have about everything.' </p>
              <p> `Why, whatever loathsome thoughts can you have?' asked Dolly, 
                smiling. </p>
              <p> `Most, most loathsome and coarse: I couldn't tell you. This 
                is not melancholy, nor boredom, but far worse. As if everything 
                of good that I had were gone out of sight, while only that which 
                was most loathsome were left. Well, how shall I put it to you?' 
                she went on, seeing incomprehension in her sister's eyes. `Papa 
                began saying something to me just now... It seems to me he thinks 
                all I need is to marry. If mamma takes me to a ball - it seems 
                to me she takes me only to marry me off as fast as possible, and 
                get me off her hands. I know this isn't so, but I can't drive 
                away such thoughts. These suitors so called - I can't bear the 
                sight of them. It seems to me as if they're always taking stock 
                of me. Formerly, to go anywhere in a ball dress was a downright 
                joy to me; I used to admire myself; now I feel ashamed, in at 
                ease. Well, take any example you like... This doctor... Now...' 
              </p>
              <p> Kitty hesitated; she wanted to say further that ever since this 
                change had taken place in her, Stepan Arkadyevich had become unbearably 
                repulsive to her, and that she could not see him without imagining 
                the grossest and most hideous things. </p>
              <p> `Well now, everything appears to me, in the coarsest, most loathsome 
                aspect,' she went on. `That is my ailment. Perhaps all this will 
                pass...' </p>
              <p> `Try not to think of such things...' </p>
              <p> `I can't help it. I feel well only when I am with the children, 
                at your house.' </p>
              <p> `What a pity you can't visit me!' </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes, I'll come. - I've had scarlatina, and I'll persuade 
                maman to let me come.' </p>
              <p> Kitty insisted on having her way, and went to stay at her sister's 
                and nursed the children all through the scarlatina - for it really 
                proved to be scarlatina. The two sisters brought all the six children 
                successfully through it; Kitty's health, however, did not improve, 
                and in Lent the Shcherbatskys went abroad. </p>

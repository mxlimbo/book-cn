                Vronsky and Kitty waltzed several times round the room. After 
                the waltz Kitty went to her mother, and she had hardly time to 
                say a few words to Countess Nordstone when Vronsky came up again 
                for the first quadrille. During the quadrille nothing of any significance 
                was said: there was disjointed talk between them of the Korsunskys, 
                husband and wife, whom he described very amusingly, as delightful 
                children at forty, and of the future popular theater; and only 
                once did the conversation touch her to the quick - when he asked 
                her whether Levin were here, and added that he liked him very 
                much. But Kitty did not expect much from the quadrille. She looked 
                forward with a sinking heart to the mazurka. She fancied that 
                the mazurka would decide everything. The fact that he did not 
                during the quadrille ask her for the mazurka did not trouble her. 
                She felt sure she would dance it with him, as she had done at 
                former balls, and refused five young men, saying she was engaged 
                for the mazurka. The whole ball up to the last quadrille was for 
                Kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors, sounds and motions. 
                She only sat down when she felt too tired and begged for a rest. 
                But as she was dancing the last quadrille with one of the tiresome 
                young men whom she could not refuse, she chanced to be vis-ид-vis 
                with Vronsky and Anna. She had not been near Anna since the beginning 
                of the evening, and now she again suddenly saw her as quite new 
                and surprising. She saw in her the signs of that excitement of 
                success she knew so well in herself; she saw that she was intoxicated 
                with the delighted admiration she was exciting. She knew that 
                feeling and knew its signs, and saw them in Anna; saw the quivering, 
                flashing light in her eyes, and the smile of happiness and excitement 
                unconsciously curving her lips, and the distinct grace, precision 
                and lightness of her movements. </p>
              <p>`Who is it?' she asked herself. `All - or one?' And without keeping 
                up her end of the conversation, the thread of which the harassed 
                young man she was dancing with lost and could not pick up again, 
                she obeyed with external liveliness the peremptory shouts of Korsunsky 
                starting them all into the grand rond, and then into the chaine, 
                and at the same time she kept watch with a growing pang at her 
                heart. `No, it's not admiration of the crowd that has intoxicated 
                her, but the adoration of one. And that one? Can it be he?' Every 
                time he spoke to Anna the joyous light flashed into her eyes, 
                and the smile of happiness curved her red lips. She seemed to 
                make an effort to control herself, in order not to show these 
                signs of delight, but they appeared on her face of themselves. 
                `But what of him?' Kitty looked at him and was horrified. What 
                was pictured so clearly to Kitty in the mirror of Anna's face 
                she saw in him. What had become of his always calm, firm manner, 
                and the carelessly calm expression of his face? Now every time 
                he turned to her he bent his head, as though he would have fallen 
                at her feet, and in his eyes there was nothing but humble submission 
                and dread. `I would not offend you,' his eyes seemed to be saying 
                each time, `but I want to save myself, and I don't know how.' 
                On his face was a look such as Kitty had never seen before. </p>
              <p> They were speaking of common acquaintances, keeping up the smallest 
                of small talk, but to Kitty it seemed that every word they said 
                was determining their fate and hers. And strangely enough, although 
                they were actually talking of how absurd Ivan Ivanovich was with 
                his French, and how the Eletsky girl might have made a better 
                match, these words were yet fraught with significance for them, 
                and they sensed this as much as Kitty did. The whole ball, the 
                whole world, everything seemed screened by a fog within Kitty's 
                soul. Nothing but the stern discipline of her bringing-up supported 
                her and forced her to do what was expected of her - that is, to 
                dance, to answer questions, to talk, even to smile. But before 
                the mazurka, when they were beginning to rearrange the chairs 
                and a few couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big 
                room, a moment of despair and horror came for Kitty. She had refused 
                five partners, and now she was not dancing the mazurka. She had 
                not even a hope of being asked for it, because she was so successful 
                in society that the idea would never occur to anyone that she 
                had remained disengaged till now. She would have to tell her mother 
                she felt ill and go home, yet she had not the strength to do this. 
                She felt crushed. </p>
              <p> She went to the farthest end of the second drawing room and 
                sank into a low chair. Her light, transparent skirts rose like 
                a cloud about her slender waist; one bare, thin, soft, girlish 
                arm, hanging listlessly, was lost in the folds of her pink tunic; 
                in the other she held her fan and with rapid, short strokes fanned 
                her burning face. Yet, while she looked like a butterfly clinging 
                to a blade of grass, and just about to open its rainbow wings 
                for fresh flight, her heart ached with a horrible despair. </p>
              <p> `But perhaps I am wrong - perhaps it was not so?' And again 
                she recalled all she had seen. </p>
              <p> `Kitty, what is it?' said Countess Nordstone, stepping noiselessly 
                over the carpet toward her. `I don't understand it.' </p>
              <p> Kitty's lower lip began to quiver; she got up quickly. </p>
              <p> `Kitty, you're not dancing the mazurka?' </p>
              <p> `No, no,' said Kitty in a voice shaking with tears. </p>
              <p> `He asked her for the mazurka in my presence,' said Countess 
                Nordstone, knowing Kitty would understand who he and her were. 
                `She said: ``Why, aren't you going to dance it with Princess Shcherbatskaia?''' 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, it doesn't matter to me!' answered Kitty. </p>
              <p> No one but she herself understood her position; no one knew 
                that she had refused yesterday the man whom perhaps she loved, 
                and refused him because she had put her faith in another. </p>
              <p> Countess Nordstone found Korsunsky, with whom she was to dance 
                the mazurka, and told him to ask Kitty. </p>
              <p> Kitty danced in the first couple, and luckily for her she had 
                not to talk because Korsunsky was all the time running about, 
                overseeing his demesne. Vronsky and Anna were sitting almost opposite 
                her. She saw them with her farsighted eyes, and saw them, too, 
                close by when they met in the figures, and the more she saw of 
                them the more convinced was she that her unhappiness was consummated. 
                She saw that they felt themselves alone in this crowded room. 
                And on Vronsky's face, always so firm and independent, she saw 
                the look that had struck her, of bewilderment and humble submissiveness, 
                like the expression of an intelligent dog when it has done wrong. 
              </p>
              <p> Anna smiled - and her smile was reflected by him. She grew thoughtful 
                - and he became serious. Some supernatural force drew Kitty's 
                eyes to Anna's face. She was charming in her simple black dress; 
                charming were her round arms with their bracelets; charming was 
                her firm neck with its thread of pearls; charming the straying 
                curls of her loose hair; charming the graceful, light movements 
                of her little feet and hands, charming was that lovely face in 
                its animation - yet there was something terrible and cruel in 
                her charm. </p>
              <p> Kitty admired her more than ever, and more and more acute did 
                her suffering grow. Kitty felt crushed, and her face showed it. 
                When Vronsky caught sight of her, coming upon her in the mazurka, 
                he did not at once recognize her, so changed was she. </p>
              <p> `Delightful ball!' he said to her, merely for the sake of saying 
                something. </p>
              <p> `Yes,' she answered. </p>
              <p> In the middle of the mazurka, repeating a complicated figure, 
                newly invented by Korsunsky, Anna came forward into the center 
                of the circle, chose two gentlemen, and summoned Kitty and another 
                lady. Kitty gazed at her in dismay as she went up. Anna looked 
                at her with drooping eyelids, and smiled, pressing her hand. But, 
                noticing that Kitty only responded to her smile by a look of despair 
                and amazement, she turned away from her, and began gaily talking 
                to the other lady. </p>
              <p> `Yes, there is something uncanny, devilish and charming about 
                her,' said Kitty to herself. </p>
              <p> Anna did not want to stay for supper, but the master of the 
                house began urging her. </p>
              <p> `Nonsense, Anna Arkadyevna,' said Korsunsky placing her bare 
                hand upon his coat sleeve. `I've such an idea for a cotillon! 
                Un bijou!' </p>
              <p> And he moved gradually on, trying to draw her along with him. 
                Their host smiled approvingly. </p>
              <p> `No, I'm not going to stay,' answered Anna, smiling, but, in 
                spite of her smile, both Korsunsky and the master of the house 
                saw from her resolute tone that she would not stay. </p>
              <p> `No; why, as it is, I have danced more at your ball in Moscow 
                than I have all the winter in Peterburg,' said Anna, looking round 
                at Vronsky, who stood near her. `I must rest a little before my 
                journey.' </p>
              <p> `Are you definitely going tomorrow then?' asked Vronsky. </p>
              <p> `Yes, I suppose so,' answered Anna, as though wondering at the 
                boldness of his question; but the irrepressible, quivering brilliance 
                of her eyes and her smile set him on fire as she said it. </p>
              <p> Anna Arkadyevna did not stay to supper, but went home. </p>

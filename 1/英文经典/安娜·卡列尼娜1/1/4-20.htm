                Alexei Alexandrovich took leave of Betsy in the drawing room, 
                and went to his wife. She was lying down, but hearing his steps 
                she sat up hastily in her former attitude, and looked in a scared 
                way at him. He saw she had been crying. </p>
              <p>`I am very grateful for your confidence in me.' He repeated gently 
                in Russian the phrase he had said in Betsy's presence in French, 
                and sat down beside her. When he spoke to her in Russian, using 
                the Russian `thou' of intimacy and affection, it was insufferably 
                irritating to Anna. `And I am very grateful for your decision. 
                I, too, imagine that since he is going away, there is no sort 
                of necessity for Count Vronsky to come here. However, if...' </p>
              <p> `But I've said so already, so why repeat it?' Anna suddenly 
                interrupted him, with an irritation she could not succeed in repressing. 
                `No sort of necessity,' she thought, `for a man to come and say 
                good-by to the woman he loves, for whom he was ready to ruin himself, 
                and has ruined himself, and who cannot live without him. No sort 
                of necessity!' She compressed her lips, and dropped her burning 
                eyes to his hands with their swollen veins. They were slowly rubbing 
                each other. `Let us never speak of it,' she added more calmly. 
              </p>
              <p> `I have left this question to you to decide, and I am very glad 
                to see...' Alexei Alexandrovich was beginning. </p>
              <p> `That my wish coincides with your own,' she finished quickly, 
                exasperated at his talking so slowly while she knew beforehand 
                all he would say. </p>
              <p> `Yes,' he assented; `and Princess Tverskaia's interference in 
                the most difficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for. She 
                especially...' </p>
              <p> `I don't believe a word of what's said about her,' said Anna 
                quickly. `I know she really cares for me.' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich sighed and said nothing. She played nervously 
                with the tassel of her dressing gown, glancing at him with that 
                torturing sensation of physical repulsion for which she blamed 
                herself, though she could not control it. Her only desire now 
                was to be rid of his repelling presence. </p>
              <p> `I have just sent for the doctor,' said Alexei Alexandrovich. 
              </p>
              <p> `I am very well; what do I want the doctor for?' </p>
              <p> `No - the little one cries, and they say the wet nurse hasn't 
                enough milk.' </p>
              <p> `Why didn't you let me nurse her, when I begged to? Anyway' 
                (Alexei Alexandrovich knew what was meant by that `anyway'), `she's 
                a baby, and they're killing her.' She rang the bell and ordered 
                the baby to be brought her. `I begged to nurse her, I wasn't allowed 
                to, and now I'm blamed for it.' </p>
              <p> `I don't blame...' </p>
              <p> `Yes, you do blame me! My God! Why didn't I die!' And she broke 
                into sobs. `Forgive me, I'm nervous, I'm unjust,' she said, controlling 
                herself, `but do go away...' </p>
              <p> `No, it can't go on like this,' Alexei Alexandrovich said to 
                himself resolutely as he left his wife's room. </p>
              <p> Never had the impossibility of his position in the world's eyes, 
                and his wife's hatred of him, and, above all, the might of that 
                mysterious brutal force that guided his life against his spiritual 
                inclinations and exacted conformity with its decrees and a change 
                in his present attitude to his wife - never had it been presented 
                to him with such distinctness as on that day. He saw clearly that 
                all the world and Anna expected something of him, but what exactly 
                he could not make out. He felt that this was rousing in his soul 
                a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind, and of all 
                the good of his achievement. He believed that for Anna herself 
                it would be better to break off all relations with Vronsky; but 
                if they all thought this out of the question, he was even ready 
                to allow these relations to be renewed, so long as the children 
                were not disgraced, and he was not deprived of them nor forced 
                to change his position. Bad as this might be, it was at any rate 
                better than a rupture, which would put her in a hopeless and shameful 
                position, and deprive him of everything he cared for. But he felt 
                helpless; he knew beforehand that everyone was against him, and 
                that he would not be allowed to do what seemed to him now so natural 
                and right, but would be forced to do what was wrong, though to 
                them it seemed the proper thing. </p>

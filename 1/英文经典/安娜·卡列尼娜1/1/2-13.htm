                Levin put on his big boots, and, for the first time, a cloth overcoat 
                instead of his fur cloak, and went out to look after his farm, 
                stepping over streams of water that flashed in the sunshine and 
                dazzled his eyes, and stepping one minute on ice and the next 
                into sticky mud. </p>
              <p>Spring is the time of plans and projects. And, as he came out 
                into the farmyard, Levin, like a tree in spring that knows not 
                what form will be taken by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned 
                in its swelling buds, hardly knew what undertakings he was going 
                to launch upon now in the farmwork that was so dear to him. But 
                he felt that he was full of the most splendid plans and projects. 
                First of all he went to the cattle. The cows had been let out 
                into their paddock, and their smooth sides were already glossy 
                with their new, sleek, spring coats; they basked in the sunshine 
                and lowed to go to the meadow. Levin gazed admiringly at the cows 
                he knew so intimately to the minutest detail of their condition, 
                and gave orders for them to be driven out into the meadow, and 
                the calves to be let into the paddock. The herdsman ran gaily 
                to get ready for the meadow. The cowherd girls, picking up their 
                petticoats, ran splashing through the mud with bare legs, still 
                white, not yet brown from the sun, waving brushwood in their hands, 
                chasing the calves that frolicked in the mirth of spring. </p>
              <p> After admiring the increase of that year, which were particularly 
                fine - the early calves were the size of a peasant's cow, and 
                Pava's daughter, at three months old, was as big as a yearling 
                - Levin gave orders for a trough to be brought out and hay to 
                be put in the racks. But it appeared that, since the paddock had 
                not been used during the winter, the racks made in the autumn 
                were broken. He sent for the carpenter, who, according to his 
                orders, ought to have been at work at the threshing machine. But 
                it appeared that the carpenter was repairing the harrows, which 
                ought to have been repaired before Lent. This was very annoying 
                to Levin. It was annoying to come upon that everlasting slovenliness 
                in the farmwork against which he had been striving with all his 
                might for so many years. The racks, as he ascertained, being not 
                wanted in winter, had been carried to the cart horses' stable, 
                and there broken, as they were of light construction, only meant 
                for foddering calves. Moreover, it was apparent also that the 
                harrows and all the agricultural implements, which he had directed 
                to be looked over and repaired in the winter, for which very purpose 
                he had hired three carpenters, had not been put into repair, and 
                the harrows were being repaired when they ought to have been harrowing 
                the field. Levin sent for his bailiff, but immediately went off 
                himself to look for him. The bailiff, beaming all over, like everything 
                that day, in a sheepskin bordered with astrakhan, came out of 
                the barn, twisting a bit of straw in his hands. </p>
              <p> `Why isn't the carpenter at the threshing machine?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, I meant to tell you yesterday, the harrows want repairing. 
                Here it's time they got to work in the fields.' </p>
              <p> `But what were they doing in the winter, then?' </p>
              <p> `But what did you want the carpenter for?' </p>
              <p> `Where are the racks for the calves' paddock?' </p>
              <p> `I ordered them to be got ready. What would you have with those 
                people!' said the bailiff, with a wave of his hand. </p>
              <p> `It's not those people but this bailiff!' said Levin, getting 
                angry. `Why, what do I keep you for?' he cried. But, bethinking 
                himself that this would not help matters, he stopped short in 
                the middle of a sentence, and merely sighed. `Well, what do you 
                say? Can sowing begin?' he asked, after a pause. </p>
              <p> `Behind Turkino, tomorrow or next day, they might begin.' </p>
              <p> `And the clover?' </p>
              <p> `I've sent Vassilii and Mishka; they're sowing it. Only I don't 
                know if they'll manage to get through; it's so slushy.' </p>
              <p> `How many dessiatinas? </p>
              <p> `Six.' </p>
              <p> `Why not sow all?' cried Levin. </p>
              <p> That they were only sowing the clover on six dessiatinas, not 
                in all the twenty, was still more annoying to him. Clover, as 
                he knew, both from books and from his own experience, never did 
                well except when it was sown as early as possible, almost in the 
                snow. And yet Levin could never get this done. </p>
              <p> `There's no one to send. What would you do with such people? 
                Three haven't turned up. And there's Semion...' </p>
              <p> `Well, you should have taken some men from the chaffcutter.' 
              </p>
              <p> `And so I have, as it is.' </p>
              <p> `Where are the peasants, then?' </p>
              <p> `Five are making compote' (which meant compost), `and four are 
                shifting the oats for fear of being touched, Konstantin Dmitrich.' 
              </p>
              <p> Levin knew very well that `touching' meant that his English 
                seed oats were already spoiled. Again they had not done as he 
                had ordered. </p>
              <p> `Why, but I told you during Lent to put in pipes,' he cried. 
              </p>
              <p> `Don't be put out; we shall get it all done in time.' </p>
              <p> Levin made an angry gesture, and went into the granary to glance 
                at the oats, and then to the stable. The oats were not yet spoiled. 
                But the laborers were carrying the oats in spades when they might 
                simply let them slide down into the lower granary; and arranging 
                for this to be done, and taking two laborers from there for sowing 
                clover, Levin got over the vexation his bailiff had caused him. 
                Indeed, it was such a lovely day that one could not be angry. 
              </p>
              <p> `Ignat!' he called to the coachman, who, with his sleeves tucked 
                up, was washing the carriage wheels, `saddle...' </p>
              <p> `Which, sir?' </p>
              <p> `Well, let it be Kolpik.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, sir.' </p>
              <p> While they were saddling his horse, Levin again called the bailiff, 
                who was hanging about in sight, to make it up with him, and began 
                talking to him about the spring operations before them, and his 
                plans for the farming. </p>
              <p> The wagons were to begin carting manure earlier, so as to get 
                all done before the early mowing. And the plowing of the outlying 
                land was to go on without a break, so as to let it lie black fallow 
                and furrowed. And the moving to be all done by hired labor, not 
                on half-profits. </p>
              <p> The bailiff listened attentively, and obviously made an effort 
                to approve of his employer's projects. But still he had that look 
                Levin knew so well that always irritated him, a look of hopelessness 
                and despondency. That look said: `That's all very well, but as 
                God wills.' </p>
              <p> Nothing mortified Levin so much as that tone. But it was the 
                tone common to all the bailiffs he had ever had. They had all 
                taken that attitude to his plans, and so now he was not angered 
                by it, but mortified, and felt all the more roused to struggle 
                against this apparently elemental force continually ranged against 
                him, for which he could find no other name than `as God wills.' 
              </p>
              <p> `If we can manage it, Konstantin Dmitrich,' said the bailiff. 
              </p>
              <p> `Why shouldn't you manage it?' </p>
              <p> `We positively must have fifteen laborers more. And they don't 
                turn up. There were some here today asking seventy roubles for 
                the summer.' </p>
              <p> Levin was silent. Again he was brought face to face with that 
                opposing force. He knew that however much they tried, they could 
                not hire more than forty - thirty-seven perhaps or thirty-eight 
                - laborers for a reasonable sum; some forty had been taken on, 
                and there were no more. But still he could not help struggling 
                against it. </p>
              <p> `Send to Sury, to Chefirovka, if they don't come. We must look 
                for them.' </p>
              <p> `I'll send, to be sure,' said Vassilii Fiodorovich despondently. 
                `But then there are the horses - they're not good for much.' </p>
              <p> `We'll get some more. I know, of course,' Levin added laughing, 
                `you always want to do with as little and as poor a quality as 
                possible; but this year I'm not going to let you have things your 
                own way. I'll see to everything myself.' </p>
              <p> `Why, I don't think you take much rest as it is. It cheers us 
                up to work under the master's eye....' </p>
              <p> `So they're sowing clover behind the Birch Dale? I'll go and 
                have a look at them,' he said, mounting the little bay cob, Kolpik, 
                who was led up by the coachman. </p>
              <p> `You can't get across the stream, Konstantin Dmitrich,' the 
                coachman shouted. </p>
              <p> `All right, I'll go by the forest.' </p>
              <p> And Levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate 
                and out into the open country, his good little horse, after his 
                long inactivity, ambling easily, snorting over the pools, and 
                asking, as it were, for guidance. </p>
              <p> If Levin had felt happy before in the cattle pens and farmyard, 
                he felt happier yet in the open country. Swaying rhythmically 
                with the ambling paces of his good little cob, drinking in the 
                warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air, as he rode through 
                his forest over the crumbling, wasted snow, still left in parts, 
                and covered with dissolving tracks, he rejoiced over every tree, 
                with the moss reviving on its bark and the buds swelling on its 
                shoots. When he came out of the forest, in the immense plain before 
                him, his winter fields stretched in an unbroken carpet of green, 
                without one bare place or swamp, only spotted here and there in 
                the hollows with patches of melting snow. He was not put out of 
                temper even by the sight of the peasants' horse and colt trampling 
                down his young grass (he told a peasant he met to drive them out), 
                nor by the sarcastic and stupid reply of the peasant Ipat, whom 
                he met on the way, and asked, `Well, Ipat, shall we soon be sowing?' 
                `We must get the plowing done first, Konstantin Dmitrich,' answered 
                Ipat. The farther he rode, the happier he became, and plans for 
                the land rose to his mind each better than the last: to plant 
                all his fields with hedges along the southern borders, so that 
                the snow should not lie under them; to divide them up into six 
                fields of tillage and three for pasture and hay; to build a cattle 
                yard at the further end of the estate, and to dig a pond and to 
                construct movable pens for the cattle as a means of manuring the 
                land. And then three hundred dessiatinas of wheat, one hundred 
                of potatoes, and one hundred and fifty of clover, and not a dessiatina 
                exhausted. </p>
              <p> Absorbed in such dreams, carefully keeping his horse by the 
                hedges so as not to trample his young winter fields, he rode up 
                to the laborers who had been sent to sow clover. A telega with 
                the seed in it was standing, not at the edge, but in the middle 
                of the tillage, and the winter corn had been torn up by the wheels 
                and trampled by the horse. Both the laborers were sitting in the 
                hedge, probably smoking a pipe, turn and turn about. The earth 
                in the telega, with which the seed was mixed, was not crushed 
                to powder, but crusted together or adhering in clods. Seeing the 
                master, the laborer, Vassilii, went toward the telega, while Mishka 
                set to work sowing. This was not as it should be, but with the 
                laborers Levin seldom lost his temper. When Vassilii came up, 
                Levin told him to lead the horse to the hedge. </p>
              <p> `Never mind, sir, it'll spring up again,' responded Vassilii. 
              </p>
              <p> `Please don't argue,' said Levin, `but do as you're told.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, sir,' answered Vassilii, and he took the horse's head. 
                `What a sowing, Konstantin Dmitrich!' he said ingratiatingly. 
                `First-rate. Only it's a work to get about! A fellow drags thirty 
                pounds of earth at every step.' </p>
              <p> `Why is it you have earth that's not sifted?' said Levin. </p>
              <p> `Well, we crumble it up,' answered Vassilii, taking up some 
                seed and rolling the earth in his palms. </p>
              <p> Vassilii was not to blame for their having fired up his telega 
                with unsifted earth, but still it was annoying. </p>
              <p> Levin had already, more than once, tried a way he knew for stifling 
                his anger, and turning all that seemed dark right again, and he 
                tried that way now. He watched how Mishka strode along, swinging 
                the huge clods of earth that clung to each foot; and, getting 
                off his horse, he took the sieve from Vassilii and started sowing 
                himself. </p>
              <p> `Where did you stop?' </p>
              <p> Vassilii pointed to the mark with his foot, and Levin went forward 
                as best he could, scattering the seed on the land. Walking was 
                as difficult as on a bog, and by the time Levin had ended the 
                row he was in a great heat, and, stopping, gave the sieve over 
                to Vassilii. </p>
              <p> `Well master, when summer's here, mind you don't scold me for 
                this row,' said Vassilii. </p>
              <p> `Eh?' said Levin cheerily, already feeling the effect of his 
                method. </p>
              <p> `Why, you'll see in the summertime. It'll look different. Look 
                you where I sowed last spring. How I did work at it I do my best, 
                Konstantin Dmitrich, d'ye see, as I would for my own father. I 
                don't like botchwork myself, nor would I let another man do it. 
                What's good for the master is good for us too. It does one's heart 
                good,' said Vassilii, pointing, `to look over yonder.' </p>
              <p> `It's a lovely spring, Vassilii.' </p>
              <p> `Why, it's a spring such as even the old men don't remember 
                the like of. I was up home; my father there has sown wheat too, 
                three osminas of it. He was saying you couldn't tell it from rye.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Have you been sowing wheat long?' </p>
              <p> `Why, sir, it was you taught us, the year before last. You gave 
                me two measures. We sold about one chetvert and sowed three osminas.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, mind you crumble up the clods,' said Levin, going toward 
                his horse, `and keep an eye on Mishka. And if there's a good crop 
                you shall have half a rouble for every dessiatina.' </p>
              <p> `Thank you, kindly. We are very well content, sir, with your 
                treatment, as it is.' </p>
              <p> Levin got on his horse and rode toward the field where last 
                year's clover was, and the one which was plowed ready for the 
                spring corn. </p>
              <p> The crop of clover coming up in the stubble was magnificent. 
                It had revived already, and stood up vividly green through the 
                broken stalks of last year's wheat. The horse sank in up to the 
                pasterns, and he drew each hoof with a sucking sound out of the 
                half-thawed ground. Over the plowland the riding was utterly impossible; 
                the horse could only keep a foothold where there was ice, and 
                in the thawing furrows he sank in deep at each step. The plowland 
                was in splendid condition; in a couple of days it would be fit 
                for harrowing and sowing. Everything was capital, everything was 
                cheering. Levin rode back across the streams, hoping the water 
                would have gone down. And he did in fact get across, and startled 
                two ducks. `There must be woodcock here too,' he thought, and 
                just as he reached the turning homewards he met the forest keeper, 
                who confirmed his theory about the woodcock. </p>
              <p> Levin went home at a trot, so as to have time to eat his dinner 
                and get his gun ready for the evening. </p>

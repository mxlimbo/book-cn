              <p align="center" class="h">Chapter 11</p>
              <p><br>
                In the middle of July the elder of the village on Levin's sister's 
                estate, about twenty verstas from Pokrovskoe, came to Levin to 
                report about the hay, and how things were going there. The chief 
                source of income on his sister's estate was from the water meadows. 
                In former years the hay had been bought by the peasants for twenty 
                roubles the dessiatina. When Levin took over the management of 
                the estate, he thought on examining the grasslands that they were 
                worth more, and he fixed the price at twenty-five roubles the 
                dessiatina. The peasants would not give that price, and, as Levin 
                suspected, kept off other purchasers. Then Levin had driven over 
                himself, and arranged to have the grass cut, partly by hired labor, 
                partly at a payment of a certain proportion of the crop. The peasants 
                of this village put every hindrance they could in the way of this 
                new arrangement, but it was carried out, and the first year the 
                meadows had yielded a profit almost double. Two years ago and 
                the previous year the peasants had maintained the same opposition 
                to the arrangement, and the hay had been cut on the same system. 
                This year the peasants were doing all the mowing for a third of 
                the hay crop, and the village elder had come now to announce that 
                the hay had been cut, and that, fearing rain, he had invited the 
                countinghouse clerk over, had divided the crop in his presence, 
                and had raked together eleven stacks as the owner's share. From 
                the vague answers to his question how much hay had been cut on 
                the principal meadow, from the hurry of the village elder who 
                had made the division, without asking leave, from the whole tone 
                of the peasant, Levin perceived that there was something wrong 
                in the division of the hay, and made up his mind to drive over 
                himself to look into the matter. </p>
              <p>Arriving by dinnertime at the village, and leaving his horse 
                at the cottage of an old friend of his, the husband of his brother's 
                wet nurse, Levin went to see the old man in his beehouse, wanting 
                to find out from him the truth about the hay. Parmenich, a talkative, 
                comely old man, gave Levin a very warm welcome, showed him all 
                he was doing, told him everything about his bees and the swarms 
                of that year; but gave vague and unwilling answers to Levin's 
                inquiries about the mowing. This confirmed Levin still more in 
                his suspicions. He went to the hayfields and examined the stacks. 
                The haystacks could not possibly contain fifty wagonloads each, 
                and to convict the peasants Levin ordered the wagons that had 
                carried the hay to be brought up directly, to lift one stack, 
                and carry it into the barn. There turned out to be only thirty-two 
                loads in the stack. In spite of the village elder's assertions 
                about the compressibility of hay, and its having settled down 
                in the stacks, and his swearing that everything had been done 
                in fear of God, Levin stuck to his point that the hay had been 
                divided without his orders, and that, therefore, he would not 
                accept that hay as fifty loads to a stack. After a prolonged dispute 
                the matter was decided by the peasants taking, as their share, 
                these eleven stacks, reckoning them as fifty loads each, and apportioning 
                the owner's share anew. The arguments and the division of the 
                haycocks lasted the whole afternoon. When the last of the hay 
                had been divided, Levin, entrusting the superintendence of the 
                rest to the countinghouse clerk, sat down on a haycock marked 
                off by a stake of willow, and looked admiringly at the meadow 
                swarming with peasants. </p>
              <p> In front of him, in the bend of the river beyond the little 
                marsh, moved a bright-colored line of peasant women, merrily chattering 
                with their ringing voices, and the scattered hay was being rapidly 
                formed into gray winding rows over the pale green aftermath. After 
                the women came the men with pitchforks, and from the gray rows 
                there were growing up broad, high, soft haycocks. To the left 
                telegas were rumbling over the meadow that had been already cleared, 
                and one after another the haycocks vanished, flung up in huge 
                forkfuls, and in their place there were rising heavy cartloads 
                of fragrant hay hanging over the horses' hindquarters. </p>
              <p> `What weather for haying! What hay it'll be!' said an old man, 
                squatting down beside Levin. `It's tea, not hay It's like scattering 
                grain to the ducks, the way they pick it up!' he added, pointing 
                to the growing haycocks. `Since dinnertime they've carried a good 
                half of it.' </p>
              <p> `The last load, eh?' he shouted to a young peasant, who drove 
                by, standing in the front of an empty telega box, shaking the 
                reins of hemp. </p>
              <p> `The last, dad!' the lad shouted back, pulling in the horse, 
                and, smiling, he looked round at a bright, rosy-cheeked peasant 
                girl who sat in the telega box, smiling too, and drove on. </p>
              <p> `Who's that? Your son?' asked Levin. </p>
              <p> `My dear youngest,' said the old man with a tender smile. </p>
              <p> `What a fine fellow!' </p>
              <p> `The lad's all right.' </p>
              <p> `Married already?' </p>
              <p> `Yes, it's two years last St. Philip's day.' </p>
              <p> `Any children?' </p>
              <p> `Children, indeed! Why, for over a year he was innocent as a 
                babe himself, and bashful too,' answered the old man. `What hay 
                this is! It's tea indeed!' he repeated, wishing to change the 
                subject. </p>
              <p> Levin looked more attentively at Vanka Parmenov and his wife. 
                They were loading a haycock onto the wagon not far from him. Ivan 
                Parmenov was standing on the wagon, taking, laying in place, and 
                stamping down the huge bundles of hay, which his pretty young 
                wife deftly handed up to him, at first in armfuls, and then on 
                the pitchfork. The young wife worked easily, merrily, and deftly. 
                The close-packed hay did not once break away by her fork. First 
                she tedded it, stuck the fork into it, then with a rapid, supple 
                movement leaned the whole weight of her body on it, and at once 
                with a bend of her back under the red belt she drew herself up, 
                and arching her full bosom under the long white apron, with a 
                deft turn swung the fork in her arms, and flung the bundle of 
                hay high onto the wagon. Ivan, obviously doing his best to save 
                her every minute of unnecessary labor, made haste, opening wide 
                his arms to clutch the bundle and lay it in the wagon. As she 
                raked together what was left of the hay, the young wife shook 
                off the bits of hay that had fallen on her neck, and, arranging 
                the red kerchief that was gone backward baring her white brow, 
                not browned by the sun, she crept under the wagon to tie up the 
                load. Ivan directed her how to fasten the cord to the crosspiece, 
                and at something she said he laughed aloud. In the expressions 
                of both faces was to be seen vigorous, young, freshly awakened 
                love. </p>

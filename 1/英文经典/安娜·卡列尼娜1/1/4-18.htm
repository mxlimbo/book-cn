              <p><br>
                After the conversation with Alexei Alexandrovich, Vronsky went 
                out on the steps of the Karenins' house and stood still, with 
                difficulty remembering where he was, and where he ought to walk 
                or drive. He felt disgraced, humiliated, guilty, and deprived 
                of all possibility of washing away his humiliation. He felt thrust 
                out of the beaten track along which he had so proudly and lightly 
                walked till then. All the habits and rules of his life that had 
                seemed so firm, had turned out suddenly false and inapplicable. 
                The betrayed husband, who had figured till that time as a pitiful 
                creature, an incidental and somewhat ludicrous obstacle to his 
                happiness, had suddenly been summoned by her herself, elevated 
                to an awe-inspiring pinnacle, and on the pinnacle that husband 
                had shown himself - not malignant, not false, not ludicrous - 
                but kind and straightforward and grand. Vronsky could not but 
                feel this, and the roles were suddenly reversed. Vronsky felt 
                the other's elevation and his own abasement, the other's truth 
                and his own falsehood. He felt that the husband was magnanimous 
                even in his sorrow, while he had been base and petty in his deceit. 
                But this sense of his own humiliation before the man he had unjustly 
                despised made up only a small part of his misery. He felt unutterably 
                wretched now, for his passion for Anna, which had seemed to him 
                of late to be growing cooler, now that he knew he had lost her 
                forever, was stronger than ever it had been. He had seen all of 
                her in her illness, had come to know her very soul, and it seemed 
                to him that he had never loved her till then. And now, when he 
                had learned to know her, to love her as she should be loved, he 
                had been humiliated before her, and had lost her forever, leaving 
                with her nothing of himself but a shameful memory. Most terrible 
                of all had been his ludicrous, shameful position when Alexei Alexandrovich 
                had pulled his hands away from his humiliated face. He stood on 
                the steps of the Karenins' house like one distraught, and did 
                not know what to do. <br>
                `A hack, sir?' asked the porter. </p>
              <p> `Yes - a hack.' </p>
              <p> On getting home, after three sleepless nights, Vronsky, without 
                undressing, lay prone on the sofa, clasping his hands and laying 
                his head on them. His head was heavy. Images, memories, and ideas 
                of the strangest description followed one another with extraordinary 
                rapidity and vividness. First it was the medicine he had poured 
                out for the patient and spilled out of the spoon; then the midwife's 
                white hands; then the queer posture of Alexei Alexandrovich on 
                the floor beside the bed. </p>
              <p> `To sleep! To forget!' he said to himself with the serene confidence 
                of a healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy, he will go to 
                sleep at once. And the same instant his head did begin to feel 
                drowsy and he began to drop off into forgetfulness. The waves 
                of the sea of unconsciousness had begun to meet over his head, 
                when all at once it seemed as though a violent shock of electricity 
                had passed over him. He started so that he leaped up on the springs 
                of the sofa, and leaning on his arms got on his knees in a fright. 
                His eyes were wide open as though he had never been asleep. The 
                heaviness in his head and the flabbiness in his limbs that he 
                had felt a minute before had suddenly gone. </p>
              <p> `You may trample me in the mud,' he heard Alexei Alexandrovich's 
                words and saw him standing before him, and saw Anna's face with 
                its burning flush and glittering eyes, gazing with love and tenderness 
                not at him but at Alexei Alexandrovich; he saw his own, as he 
                fancied, foolish and ludicrous figure when Alexei Alexandrovich 
                had taken his hands away from his face. He stretched out his legs 
                again and flung himself on the sofa in the same position and shut 
                his eyes. </p>
              <p> `To sleep! To sleep!' he repeated to himself. But with his eyes 
                shut he saw more distinctly than ever Anna's face as it had been 
                on the memorable evening before the races. </p>
              <p> `This cannot, and will not be, and she wants to wipe it out 
                of her memory. But I cannot live without it. How can we be reconciled? 
                How can we be reconciled?' he said aloud, and unconsciously began 
                to repeat these words. This repetition of words checked the rising 
                of fresh images and memories, which he felt were thronging in 
                his brain. But repeating words did not check his imagination for 
                long. Again, in extraordinarily rapid succession, his best moments 
                rose before his mind, and then his recent humiliation. `Take away 
                his hands,' Anna's voice was saying. He takes away his hands and 
                feels the shame-struck and idiotic expression of his face. </p>
              <p> He was still lying down, trying to sleep, though he felt there 
                was not the smallest hope of it, and kept repeating stray words 
                from some chain of thought, trying by this to check the rising 
                flood of fresh images. He listened, and heard words repeated in 
                a strange, mad whisper: `You did not appreciate it, did not make 
                enough of it. You did not appreciate it, did not make enough of 
                it.' </p>
              <p> `What's this? Am I going out of my mind?' he said to himself 
                `Perhaps. What makes men go out of their minds - what makes men 
                shoot themselves?' he answered himself, and, opening his eyes, 
                he saw with wonder an embroidered cushion beside him, worked by 
                Varia, his brother's wife. He touched the tassel of the cushion, 
                and tried to think of Varia, of when he had seen her last. But 
                to think of anything extraneous was an agonizing effort. `No, 
                I must sleep!' He moved the cushion up, and pressed his head into 
                it, but he had to make an effort to keep his eyes shut. He jumped 
                up and sat down. `That's all over for me,' he said to himself. 
                `I must think what to do. What is left?' His mind rapidly ran 
                through his life apart from his love of Anna. </p>
              <p> `Ambition? Serpukhovskoy? Society? The Court?' He could not 
                come to a pause anywhere. All of it had had meaning before, but 
                now there was no reality in it. He got up from the sofa, took 
                off his coat, undid his belt, and, uncovering his hairy chest 
                to breathe more freely, walked up and down the room. `This is 
                how people go mad,' he repeated, `and how they shoot themselves... 
                to escape humiliation,' he added slowly. </p>
              <p> He went to the door and closed it, and then with fixed eyes 
                and clenched teeth he went up to the table, took a revolver, looked 
                it about, turned it to a loaded barrel, and sank into thought. 
                For two minutes, his head bent forward with an expression of an 
                intense effort of thought, he stood with the revolver in his hand, 
                motionless, thinking. `Of course,' he said to himself, as though 
                a logical, continuous, and clear chain of reasoning had brought 
                him to an indubitable conclusion. In reality this `of course,' 
                so convincing to him, was simply the result of repeating exactly 
                the same circle of memories and images through which he had already 
                passed ten times during the last hour. There were the same memories 
                of happiness lost forever, the same conception of the senselessness 
                of everything to come in life, the same consciousness of humiliation. 
                There was the same sequence of these images and emotions too. 
              </p>
              <p> `Of course,' he repeated, when for the third time his thought 
                passed again round the same spellbound circle of memories and 
                images, and, putting the revolver to the left side of his chest, 
                and twitching vigorously with his whole hand, as though squeezing 
                it in his fist, he pulled the trigger. He did not hear the sound 
                of the shot, but a violent blow on his chest knocked him down. 
                He tried to clutch at the edge of the table, dropped the revolver, 
                staggered, and sat down on the ground, looking about him in astonishment. 
                He did not recognize his room, as he looked up from the ground 
                at the bent legs of the table, at the wastepaper basket, and the 
                tigerskin rug. The hurried, creaking steps of his servant coming 
                through the drawing room brought him to his senses. He made an 
                effort at thought, and was aware that he was on the floor; and 
                seeing blood on the tigerskin rug and on his arm, he knew he had 
                shot himself. </p>
              <p> `Idiotic! Missed!' he said, fumbling after the revolver. The 
                revolver was close beside him - he was groping farther off. Still 
                groping for it, he stretched out to the other side, and not being 
                strong enough to keep his balance, fell over, streaming with blood. 
              </p>
              <p> The elegant, whiskered manservant, who used to be continually 
                complaining to his acquaintances of the delicacy of his nerves, 
                was so panic-stricken on seeing his master lying on the floor 
                that he left him losing blood while he ran for assistance. An 
                hour later Varia, his brother's wife, had arrived, and with the 
                assistance of three doctors, whom she had sent for in all directions, 
                and who all appeared at the same moment, she got the wounded man 
                to bed, and remained to nurse him. </p>

            <p> INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY</p>
            <p> George is wearing the same pointed hat Kathleen wore as the<br>
              Storybook Lady. There's a sign that says: Storybook Person.</p>
            <p> Several children are listening.</p>
            <p> We see:</p>
            <p> ANNABEL</p>
            <p> She's glowering.</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Kathleen is in bed with a huge box of Kleenex. She has a <br>
              terrible cold. Her nose is red, her eyes are watery. On the<br>
              bedside table are a huge assortment of atomizers, pills, etc.</p>
            <p> We hear the sound of computer keys clicking.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              Why haven't you written?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              I have a cold.</p>
            <p> INT. JOE'S OFFICE - DAY</p>
            <p> We see Joe on his computer.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              How's your cold?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              My ears are blocked, my nose is clogged.</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> She's drinking cranberry juice. Joni Mitchell on the stereo.</p>
            <p> The sound of computer keys clicking again.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              Are you feeling any better?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              I'm lying in bed listening to Joni<br>
              Mitchell and drinking cranberry juice<br>
              which I am sorry to say is the exact same<br>
              color as my nose. I keep thinking about<br>
              my future. What future? What am I <br>
              going to do?</p>
            <p> EXT. 79TH STREET BOAT BASIN - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> As Joe is walking Brinkley back to the boat. A limousine has<br>
              pulled up near the pier and the driver is unloading bags.<br>
              Joe stops to see the passenger: his father, Nelson Fox.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What are you doing here?</p>
            <p> EXT. 79TH STREET BOAT BASIN - DUSK</p>
            <p> Next to Joe's boat is a larger yacht.</p>
            <p> INT. YACHT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> In the main cabin Joe and Nelson are having drinks. Nelson<br>
              lifts his glass in a toast.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              To us.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Father and son, together at last. That<br>
              happened with Gillian?</p>
            <p> Nelson ignores the question.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              I've stayed here after, let's see, your<br>
              mother, Laurette that ballet dancer --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              -- the nanny --</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              Was she the nanny? I forgot that. How<br>
              ironic. Then there was the ice skater --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              -- also the nanny --</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              Really. How amazingly ironic. Sybil the<br>
              astrologer.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Whose moon turned out to be in somebody<br>
              else's house, as I recall.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              Just like Gillian.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Gillian ran off with someone?</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              The nanny.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Nanny Maureen? Gillian ran off with<br>
              Nanny Maureen? That's incredibly<br>
              ironic.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              True true.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              There's no other word for it.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              Who did you break up with?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Patricia. You met her.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              Would I like her?<br>
              (cracks himself up)<br>
              Just kidding. Isn't this great? Have<br>
              some peanuts. Of course I have to live<br>
              out of a suitcase for a least three<br>
              weeks, and then there's the inevitable<br>
              legal hassle, more of your inheritance<br>
              down the drain.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Don't worry about it.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              I won't. But then I get to meet someone<br>
              new. That's the easy part.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Oh, right, a snap to find the one single<br>
              person in the world who fills your heart<br>
              with joy.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              Don't be ridiculous. Have I ever been<br>
              with anyone who fits that description?<br>
              Have you?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              On to the next.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              Isn't it a beautiful night?</p>
            <p> Hold on Joe.</p>
            <p> EXT. KATHLEEN'S STREET - DAY</p>
            <p> Joe, on his way to Kathleen's apartment building, carrying a<br>
              bunch of daisies, wrapped in cellophane.</p>
            <p> Joe goes up the stoop to her building and looks at buzzer.<br>
              Sees Kelly, 3A. He presses. Nothing. Presses again.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              (voice clogged, through intercom)<br>
              Who is it?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Joe Fox.</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME</p>
            <p> Kathleen, in her pajamas, at the intercom, horrified.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              What are you doing here?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              May I please come up?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              It's really not a good idea.</p>
            <p> Someone else walks up to the door, unlocks it and walks in.<br>
              Joe follows.</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              (into the intercom)<br>
              I have a terrible cold, can you hear it?<br>
              I'm sniffling and not really awake --</p>
            <p> EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> As Kathleen continues to talk through the Intercom to an<br>
              empty stoop.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN'S VOICE<br>
              and I'm sleeping practically twenty-four<br>
              hours a day, and taking echinacea --</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              (into intercom)<br>
              -- and vitamin C, so I would really<br>
              appreciate it if you would come some<br>
              other time --</p>
            <p> There's a knock on the door right next to her. Kathleen<br>
              practically jumps out of her skin. She looks through the<br>
              peephole. There he is.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Kathleen?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Just a second.</p>
            <p> She puts on a robe, runs frantically about picking up various<br>
              scattered wadded-up Kleenexs, opens the front door. Joe is<br>
              holding a bunch of flowers wrapped in paper.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Hello.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              What are you doing here?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I heard you were sick and I was worried<br>
              and I wanted to --<br>
              (he hears voices)<br>
              Is someone here?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Just the Home Shopping Network.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Bought any porcelain dolls?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I was thinking about it.<br>
              (beat)<br>
              You put me out of business --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I know that --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              And now you turn up with flowers? Did<br>
              you come to gloat?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              To offer me a job --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              No, I wouldn't think of --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Because I have plans, I have lots of<br>
              offers. I've been offered a job by --<br>
              well, actually by --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              My former?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Former?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              We broke up.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              That's too bad. You seemed so perfect<br>
              for each other.<br>
              (she claps her hand over her mouth)<br>
              I don't mean to say things like that. No<br>
              matter what you have done to me, there is<br>
              no excuse for my saying anything like<br>
              that. But every time I see you --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Things like that just seem to fly out of<br>
              your mouth.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Yes. I'm sorry. I'm starting over.<br>
              (sharply)<br>
              Thank you for coming. Goodbye.<br>
              (she says it again, a little<br>
              more nicely)<br>
              Thank you for coming. Goodbye.</p>
            <p> She starts to the door.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I bought you flowers.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Oh.<br>
              (trying as hard as she can)<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> She takes them.</p>
            <p> He takes them back.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Why don't I put them in water?</p>
            <p> He heads for the kitchen. A beat, while she stares after him.<br>
              Then follows.</p>
            <p> INT. KITCHEN - DAY</p>
            <p> When Kathleen gets to the kitchen, Joe is checking the kettle<br>
              for water. Turns on the stove.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You're sick. Sit down, please.</p>
            <p> He pulls out a kitchen chair. Kathleen sits. She's a little<br>
              woozy.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Vase?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Upper left.</p>
            <p> He gets out a vase. Fills it with water.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              George says hello. He told me you<br>
              weren't feeling well.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              How is George?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Great. He's revolutionizing the place.<br>
              No one is allowed to work in his<br>
              department who doesn't have a Ph.D. in<br>
              children's literature.</p>
            <p> He unwraps the paper around the flowers. Daisies. Puts them<br>
              in a vase.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I love daisies.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You told me.</p>
            <p> He puts the vase on the kitchen table. Kathleen plays with<br>
              the petals.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              They're so friendly. Don't you think<br>
              they are the friendliest flower?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I do.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              When did you break up?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Oh, a couple of weeks ago.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Everyone is breaking up. You. Me. This<br>
              other person I know broke up with someone<br>
              in an elevator. I think it was in an<br>
              elevator. Or just outside it. Or after<br>
              it. It got stuck. I think. And suddenly<br>
              everything became clear. When I saw you,<br>
              at the coffee place, I was waiting for him<br>
              and I was --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              -- charming.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I was not charming.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Well, you looked charming.</p>
            <p> The teakettle whistles. Joe turns off the burner.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Tea?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Upper right.</p>
            <p> He gets out mugs and teabags and pours the water.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I was upset. And I was horrible.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Honey?</p>
            <p> Kathleen nods. He puts in two spoonfuls, gives it to her.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I was horrible.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              True. But I have no excuse.</p>
            <p> She picks up the daisies and carries them into:</p>

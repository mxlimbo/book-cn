            <p> EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY</p>
            <p> As Kathleen comes around the corner. Christina is waiting.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              What happened?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              He never came.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              He stood you up?</p>
            <p> INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER</p>
            <p> As Kathleen puts her purse into the drawer.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I think something happened, something<br>
              terrible and unexpected that made it<br>
              impossible for him --</p>
            <p> George walks in.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              What happened?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              He wasn't able to make it.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              He stood you up.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              What could have happened?<br>
              (continued)</p>
            <p> George looks suddenly stricken.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (cont'd)<br>
              Why didn't he come? Maybe he showed up,<br>
              took one look at me and left.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Not possible.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Maybe there was a subway accident.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Absolutely.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              A train was trapped underground with him<br>
              inside.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              And no phone.</p>
            <p> George continues to look stricken. He's starting to shake<br>
              his head.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Or an automobile accident. Those cab<br>
              drivers are maniacs.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              They hit something and you slam right<br>
              into that plastic partition.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              His elbows could be in splints -- so he<br>
              can't really dial --</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Or he could be in the hospital in one of<br>
              those semi-private room with like --<br>
              <br>
              CHRISTINA &amp; KATHLEEN<br>
              (together)<br>
              -- no phone.</p>
            <p> They look at George. Still shaking his head.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              (to George)<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> George hands them a New York Post. They look at the cover:<br>
              COPS NAB ROOFTOP KILLER</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              What are you saying?</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              It could be.</p>
            <p> Dead silence.</p>
            <p> GEORGE (cont'd)<br>
              He was arrested two blocks from the<br>
              cheesecake place.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Is there a picture?</p>
            <p> There it is. It's of a man with his jacket pulled over his<br>
              head.</p>
            <p> They all look at it.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              So that explains it.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              He was in jail.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              And there was a phone --</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              -- but he got only one call and he had to<br>
              use it to call his lawyer.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              You are so lucky.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              You could be dead.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Are you crazy? This man couldn't<br>
              possibly be the rooftop killer.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Remember when you thought Frank might be<br>
              the Unabomber?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              That was different.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              How long did you sit there all alone?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Not that long. Joe Fox came in --</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Joe Fox!</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I don't want to talk about it.<br>
              (closes her eyes)<br>
              Let's get to work.</p>
            <p> They look around. There's no one in the store and nothing to<br>
              do.</p>
            <p> A pause.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              There must be something to do. There's<br>
              always something to do.</p>
            <p> They hear the jingle of the front door. They look hopefully<br>
              toward it. It's only Birdie.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              He stood her up.</p>
            <p> Hold on Kathleen as the computer sound begins.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              I have been thinking about you. Last<br>
              night I went to meet you and you weren't<br>
              there. I wish I knew why. I felt so<br>
              foolish.<br>
              (continued)</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As she types. And we cut from her face to the screen as we<br>
              hear a voice-over:</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              And as I waited, someone else showed up,<br>
              a man who has made my professional life a<br>
              misery, and an amazing thing happened --<br>
              I was able, for the first time in my<br>
              life, to say the exact thing I wanted to say<br>
              it. And of course, afterwards, I felt<br>
              terrible. Just as you said I would.</p>
            <p> INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - LATER</p>
            <p> The E-mail from Kathleen continues as Joe reads.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              I was cruel, and I'm never cruel. And<br>
              even though I can hardly believe what I<br>
              said mattered to this man -- to him, I'm<br>
              just a bug to be crushed -- but what if<br>
              it did? No matter what he's done to me,<br>
              there's no excuse for my behavior.<br>
              Anyway, you are my dear friend, and I so<br>
              wanted to talk to you. I hope you have a<br>
              good reason for not being there last<br>
              night, but if you don't, and if we never<br>
              really connect again, I just want to tell<br>
              you how much it has meant to me to know<br>
              you were there.</p>
            <p> Joe sits there a second. A moment of intense ambivalence.<br>
              Then he hits the Menu key and signs off.</p>
            <p> COMPUTER<br>
              Goodbye.</p>
            <p> Joe stands and leaves the room.</p>
            <p> The computer sits there.</p>
            <p> Hold on the computer. We hear him open the refrigerator <br>
              door. We hear him close the refrigerator door. He passes<br>
              the den without even looking into it. A moment later he<br>
              comes back into the room, stares at the computer. He starts<br>
              for the bedroom, changes his mind. Circles the computer.<br>
              He's going to go cold turkey if it kills him.</p>
            <p> Fuck it. He sits down. Sign on. Starts to type.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              I am in Vancouver.</p>
            <p> He stops... Hits the delete button and erases the message.<br>
              He starts typing again:</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              I was stuck in a meeting, which I<br>
              couldn't get out of it, and there was<br>
              no phone.</p>
            <p> He backspaces to erase &quot;there was no phone.&quot;</p>
            <p> Screen now reads: I was stuck in a meeting, which I couldn't<br>
              get out of it. Joe sits there thinking for a moment. Then he<br>
              starts typing.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O., cont'd)<br>
              The electricity went out in the building<br>
              and we were trapped on the 18th floor and<br>
              the telephone system blew too.</p>
            <p> He stops and looks at it. Then he types:</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O., cont'd)<br>
              Amazingly enough.</p>
            <p> He sits looking at it.</p>
            <p> Then he deletes the whole thing.</p>
            <p> Sits looking at the blank screen.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Fuck you.</p>
            <p> He clicks the Yes box.</p>
            <p> Then he starts to type again.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              Dear friend: I cannot tell you what<br>
              happened to me last night, but I beg you<br>
              from the bottom of my heart to forgive me<br>
              for not being there.</p>
            <p> He deletes &quot;for not being there.&quot;</p>
            <p> Then types again, after &quot;to forgive me&quot;.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              -- for what happened. I feel terrible<br>
              that you found yourself in a situation<br>
              that caused you additional pain. But I'm<br>
              absolutely sure that whatever you said<br>
              last night was provoked, even deserved.<br>
              And everyone says things they regret when<br>
              they're worried or stressed. You were<br>
              expecting to see someone you trusted and<br>
              met the enemy instead. The fault is<br>
              mine.<br>
              (continued)</p>
            <p> EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY</p>
            <p> As Kathleen and Christina walk down the street together.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O., cont'd)<br>
              Someday I'll explain everything.<br>
              Meanwhile, I'm still here. Talk to me.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Did he say anything about meeting again?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Not really. It doesn't matter. We'll<br>
              just be like George Bernard Shaw and Mrs.<br>
              Patrick Campbell and write letters our<br>
              whole lives --</p>
            <p> They go into an apartment building.</p>
            <p> INT. BIRDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
            <p> A large rent-controlled West Side apartment. Birdie is <br>
              pouring tea. There's a plate of cookies.</p>
            <p> Christina is looking at the picture of Birdie as a young<br>
              woman, dressed in a sort of Carmen Miranda getup.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Where was this taken, Birdie?</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              Seville.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              When you had the thunderbolt?</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              Yes. What did you decide, dearie?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Close. We're going to close.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Close.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Although it feels like such a failure.<br>
              It feels like I'm quitting. It feels<br>
              like... Mom...</p>
            <p> She closes her eyes.</p>
            <p> Birdie sits down on the loveseat next to Kathleen, puts her<br>
              arms around her. Hold on them.</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              Keeping the store open doesn't keep your<br>
              mother alive, although sometimes I think<br>
              we all think it does.</p>
            <p> Christina looks over at the picture of Birdie.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Who was it, Birdie? That you had the<br>
              thunderbolt over?</p>
            <p> Birdie shakes her head. She's not going to tell them.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA (cont'd)<br>
              It's so romantic.</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              But it wasn't meant to be.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Why not?</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              He ran Spain.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Spain?</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              The country. He ran it. That was his<br>
              job. And then he died. Just as well.</p>
            <p> INT. SONY LINCOLN SQUARE THEATRE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As Frank and Kathleen go up the escalator, on their way to a <br>
              movie.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              She fell in love with Generalissimo<br>
              Franco?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Don't say that. We don't know that for sure.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Who else could it have been? It was<br>
              probably around 1960 --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I mean, it's not like he was something<br>
              normal, like a socialist or an anarchist<br>
              or something --</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              It happened in Spain. People do really<br>
              stupid things in foreign countries.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Absolutely. They buy leather jackets,<br>
              they go see Flamenco, they ride in<br>
              gondolas, they eat in restaurants where<br>
              guitarists sing Malaguena sola Rosa, but<br>
              they don't fall in love with fascist<br>
              dictators.</p>
            <p> They enters one of the theatres.</p>

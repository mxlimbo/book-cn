            <p> Joe follows her. They both sit.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Whereas I am a horrible person and have<br>
              no choice but to be horrible, is that<br>
              what you're saying?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              No I am not saying that because I am done<br>
              saying horrible things, even to you.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You did it again.</p>
            <p> She claps her hand over her mouth.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I put you out of business. You're<br>
              entitled to hate me.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I don't hate you --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              But you'll never forgive me. Like<br>
              Elizabeth.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Who?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice.<br>
              She was too proud --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I thought you hated Pride and Prejudice.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              -- or was she too prejudiced and Mr.<br>
              Darcy too proud? I can never remember.<br>
              (beat)<br>
              It wasn't personal --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              -- It was business. What is that<br>
              supposed to mean? I am so sick of that.<br>
              All it means is it's not personal to you,<br>
              but it's personal to me, it's personal to<br>
              a lot of people.<br>
              (she shrugs helplessly)<br>
              What's wrong with personal anyway?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Nothing.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I mean, whatever else anything is, it<br>
              ought to begin by being personal.</p>
            <p> Kathleen stands up, picks up the daisies.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              My head's starting to get funny. I have<br>
              to go back to bed.</p>
            <p> They walk to...</p>
            <p> EXT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> Kathleen puts the daisies next to the bed and gets into it.<br>
              She fluffs up the pillows, pulls up the blankets, surrounds<br>
              herself with Kleenex and Evian and sneezes a gigantic sneeze.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Why did you stop by? I forget.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I wanted to be your friend.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Oh.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I knew it wasn't possible. What can I<br>
              say? Sometimes a person just wants the<br>
              impossible. Could I ask you something?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What happened with that guy at the cafe?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Nothing.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              But you're crazy about him --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Yes. I am.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Then why don't you run off with him?<br>
              What are you waiting for?</p>
            <p> A long beat.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I don't actually know him.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Really.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              We only know each other -- oh God, you're<br>
              not going to believe this --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Let me guess. From the Internet.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You've Got Mail.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Very powerful words.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> Joe sits on the edge of the bed.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I'm happy for him. Although -- could I<br>
              make a little suggestion? I think you<br>
              should meet him. No. I take it back.<br>
              Why meet him?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              (starting to get sharp again)<br>
              I hardly think I need advice from someone<br>
              who --</p>
            <p> He reaches out and gently claps his hand over her mouth. And<br>
              holds it there. It's unexpectedly tender and sexy.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I concede I bring out the worst in you,<br>
              but let me help you not to say something<br>
              you'll just torture yourself about for<br>
              years to come.</p>
            <p> She starts to smile and he removes his hand.</p>
            <p> They look at each other.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I hope you're better soon. It would be <br>
              a shame to miss New York in the spring.</p>
            <p> Joe stands.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Thank you for the daisies.</p>
            <p> He starts for the door.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Take care.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I will.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Goodbye.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Goodbye.</p>
            <p> We hear the door close.</p>
            <p> Hold on Kathleen.</p>
            <p> EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY</p>
            <p> Christina is running. She sees a good-looking MALE RUNNER<br>
              coming toward her. She has no hope that he will notice her,<br>
              and starts to look away as they get close to one another.</p>
            <p> MALE RUNNER<br>
              Hi.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Hi.</p>
            <p> He passes her. Christina can't believe it.</p>
            <p> She does a little dance of joy.</p>
            <p> Camera pulls back as we see her by the reservoir on a <br>
              beautiful morning doing her little celebratory spin.</p>
            <p> Then she resumes her morning exercise, running on.</p>
            <p> INT. THE SINGLES TEMPLE - FRIDAY EVENING</p>
            <p> Patricia comes in.</p>
            <p> The place is packed. There are hundreds of young Jewish New<br>
              Yorkers singing folk songs and dancing the hora. The Rabbi<br>
              is dancing among them.</p>
            <p> Patricia sees the rabbi, leading the dance.</p>
            <p> The rabbi whirls madly toward her, like a human dreidel.</p>
            <p> RABBIT<br>
              Shabbat shalom!</p>
            <p> He grabs Patricia's hand, and to her surprise, they go<br>
              whirling off together.</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Kathleen at the computer, typing.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              I have been thinking about this and<br>
              I think we should meet.</p>
            <p> She clicks the send button and then exits from American On<br>
              Line.</p>
            <p> On her computer screen we now see the standard screen with<br>
              several icons: American On-Line, Word, Recycle Bin, etc.</p>
            <p> She clicks Word.</p>
            <p> She goes to File: New.</p>
            <p> There are several choices of format.</p>
            <p> She stares at the choices. Then she clicks Book format.</p>
            <p> A blank page appears in the computer.</p>
            <p> She starts to type: &quot;Once upon a time there was a little<br>
              girl named...&quot;</p>
            <p> She pauses for a moment and looks around the room. She sees<br>
              the flowers that Joe brought her.</p>
            <p> And then she types: &quot;Daisy.&quot;</p>
            <p> As she goes on typing...</p>
            <p> INT. JOE' BOAT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> On Joe typing.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              We should meet. And we will meet. But<br>
              I'm in the middle of a project that<br>
              needs...<br>
              (he pauses to think of the right word)<br>
              ... tweaking.</p>
            <p> A look of calculation on his face.</p>
            <p> EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY</p>
            <p> We can see Kathleen through the window, drinking a cup of<br>
              coffee.</p>
            <p> And now we see Joe walk into Starbucks. He waves at her,<br>
              pretending surprise at seeing her. Has he been watching the<br>
              store and waiting for her to come in? We'll never know.</p>
            <p> INT. STARBUCKS - A FEW MINUTES LATER</p>
            <p> He's sitting next to her at the counter in the window.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Tweaking?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              That's what he said.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              He's probably married.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              That's a terrible thing to say. It's not<br>
              possible.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Have you asked him if he's married? Have<br>
              you said, &quot;Are you married?&quot;</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> Joe looks at her, shrugs.</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As she types:</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              I know this is probably a little late to<br>
              be asking, but are you married?</p>
            <p> INT. JOE'S OFFICE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As he answers:</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              Am I married? What kind of a question is<br>
              that? How can you ask me that? Don't<br>
              you know me at all? Oh wait, I get it.<br>
              Your friends are telling you the reason<br>
              we haven't met is that I'm married. Am I<br>
              right?</p>
            <p> INT. SIDEWALK CAFE - ANOTHER DAY</p>
            <p> Kathleen and Joe having nachos.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              So he didn't exactly answer.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              He did too. He nailed me. He knew<br>
              exactly what I was up to. Which is just<br>
              like him.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              But he didn't exactly answer, did he?<br>
              Did he?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Maybe he's fat.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I don't care about that.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You don't care that he might be one of<br>
              those guys who's so fat he has to be<br>
              removed from his house with a crane?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              That's very unlikely.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Why else do you think he's putting off<br>
              meeting you? Although... maybe that's<br>
              not it. Maybe...</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Never mind.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              What????</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              He could be waiting til he's paroled.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Oh, you won't believe this, there was a<br>
              moment when George thought he might be<br>
              the rooftop killer, which was completely<br>
              ridiculous --</p>
            <p> Her voice trails off, as she considers whether it could be<br>
              true.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What's his handle?</p>
            <p> She shakes her head.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Come on, I'm not going to write him. Is<br>
              that what you think?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              NY 152.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              One five two. One hundred fifty two.<br>
              Very interesting. He's 152 years old.<br>
              He has 152 hairs remaining on his head.<br>
              He's had 152 moles removed and now he<br>
              has 152 pockmarks.</p>

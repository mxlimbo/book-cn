            <p> INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
            <p> Patricia comes in as Joe is waiting for Kathleen's response.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Look what I bought.</p>
            <p> Joe types &quot;Ciao&quot; and signs off. Looks up to see Patricia<br>
              showing him a Plexiglas menorah.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              I was just passing this store on Columbus<br>
              Avenue and it caught my eye.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What is it?</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              A Menorah.<br>
              JOE<br>
              It doesn't look like a Menorah.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              I know. I don't know what came over me.<br>
              I don't even celebrate Hanukkah.</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> As Kathleen logs off, Frank comes in.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Frank, I've decided to go to the<br>
              mattresses. Do you think it would be a<br>
              gigantic conflict of interest if you<br>
              wrote something about us?</p>
            <p> INT. THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY</p>
            <p> It's January. The store is more crowded than we've seen it.<br>
              Frank is there with several copies of the Independent. The<br>
              phone is ringing off the hook. Christina and George are<br>
              fielding calls. Birdie is reading Frank's article.</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              (reading)<br>
              &quot;Kathleen Kelly and her mother Cecilia<br>
              Kelly have raised your children. If this<br>
              precious resource is killed by the cold<br>
              cash cow of Foxbooks, it will not only be<br>
              the end of Western civilization as we<br>
              know it, but the end of something even<br>
              dearer: our neighborhood as we know it.<br>
              Save the Shop Around the Corner and you<br>
              will save your own soul.&quot; Frank, that's<br>
              charming.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              You think it's a little over the top?</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              Just say thank you.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>

              Channel 2's outside.</p>
            <p> INT. BACK ROOM - THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - SAME TIME</p>
            <p> Kathleen is primping in a tiny wall mirror. She takes a deep<br>
              breath.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              In a second.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>

              The Village Voice is coming.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Omigod.</p>
            <p> Frank sticks his head in.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              (in shock)<br>
              It's him.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Who?</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              God. It is God.</p>
            <p> INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> Kathleen comes out of the storage room.</p>
            <p> William Spungeon is standing there.</p>
            <p> WILLIAM SPUNGEON<br>
              I'm William Spungeon.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I'm very pleased to meet you. I'm<br>
              Kathleen Kelly.</p>
            <p> Frank is practically levitating.</p>
            <p> SPUNGEON<br>
              I knew your mother. Although she knew me<br>
              only as W. That enormous bookstore is<br>
              obscene.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              I'm Frank Navasky. I carry your picture<br>
              in my wallet.</p>
            <p> He pulls it out. Spungeon looks at him like he's crazy.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              We've organized pickets. Channel 13 is<br>
              doing a special.</p>
            <p> SPUNGEON<br>
              I'd be glad to talk to the press if it's<br>
              all right with you. They've been trying<br>
              to interview me for years.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              The press? I'm the press.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              You'd allow that? For me? For the<br>
              store? That's incredible. Although you<br>
              wouldn't have to be photographed. I<br>
              respect that. If it's television, they<br>
              could just put one of those blurry dots<br>
              in front of your face.</p>
            <p> SPUNGEON<br>
              No television.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              (referring to the TV crew)<br>
              They're waiting for you --</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              I know all your books. Phaelox the<br>
              gnome, the little man who comes from<br>
              nowhere... and is going nowhere...<br>
              (quoting)<br>
              &quot;Where did you come from?&quot; &quot;Nowhere.&quot;<br>
              &quot;Where are you going?&quot; &quot;Nowhere.&quot;</p>
            <p> SPUNGEON<br>
              Cool it. I'm starting to break out in<br>
              hives.<br>
              (to Kathleen)<br>
              Here's my phone number.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I had no idea William Spugeon had a<br>
              phone.</p>
            <p> SPUNGEON<br>
              Adios.</p>
            <p> He gives a little wave and leaves.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              This is historic.<br>
              (beat)<br>
              Do you realize what I've done? By<br>
              writing that piece, do you realize?<br>
              I've brought William Spungeon in from<br>
              the cold. Holy shit. I am completely<br>
              amazing.</p>
            <p> At that moment a TV REPORTER sticks her head into the store.</p>
            <p> TV REPORTER<br>
              Kathleen Kelly?</p>
            <p> Kathleen takes a deep breath, walks out the door.</p>
            <p> EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - A FEW MINUTES LATER</p>
            <p> CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER<br>
              Are you ready, Miss Kelly?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.</p>
            <p> CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Never mind. I'm ready. Shoot.</p>
            <p> INT. TELEVISION SCREEN - THAT NIGHT</p>
            <p> CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER<br>
              We're here in front of the Shop Around<br>
              the Corner, the famous West Side<br>
              children's bookstore now on the verge of<br>
              having to close its doors because the big<br>
              bad wolf, Foxbooks, has opened only a few<br>
              hundred feet away, wooing customers with<br>
              its sharp discounts and designer coffee.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              They have to have discounts and lattes,<br>
              because most of the people who work there<br>
              have never read a book.</p>
            <p> And pull back now to reveal that we're in:</p>
            <p> INT. GYM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Five TV sets are on, over adjoining treadmills, Joe and<br>
              Kevin are on two of the treadmills, walking and watching.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              She's not as nice as she seems on<br>
              television.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              You've met her?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              She's kind of a pill.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              She's probably not as attractive as she<br>
              seems on television either.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              No, she's beautiful. But a pill.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              So you don't feel bad about basically<br>
              destroying her livelihood not to mention<br>
              her legacy not to mention her raison<br>
              d'etre.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              It's not personal --</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              It's business.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Right. Exactly.</p>
            <p> They look up at the television.</p>
            <p> INT. TELEVISION SCREEN - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> Joe onscreen, with a super: Joe Fox, Vice-President Foxbooks.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I sell cheap books. Sue me. I sell<br>
              cheap books, and as a result -- listen <br>
              to this, because it's really bad --<br>
              more people can buy books.</p>
            <p> The show immediately cuts back to the newscaster.</p>
            <p> On Joe and Kevin.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              That's what you said?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              (outraged)<br>
              That's not all I said. I said -- I can't<br>
              believe those bastards -- I said we were<br>
              great, I said people can come and sit and<br>
              read for hours and no one bothers them, I<br>
              said we stock 150,000 titles, I showed<br>
              them the New York City section. I said<br>
              we were a goddamn piazza where people<br>
              could mingle and mix and be.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              A piazza?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I was eloquent. Shit. It's just<br>
              inevitable, isn't it? People are going<br>
              to want to turn her into Joan of Arc --</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              -- and you into Attila the Hun.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Well it's not me personally, it's more<br>
              like it's the company --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              (on the television)<br>
              And I have to say, I have met Joe Fox,<br>
              who owns Foxbooks, and I have heard him<br>
              compared his store to a Price Club and the<br>
              books in it to cans of olive oil.</p>
            <p> On Joe, reacting.</p>
            <p> EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER</p>
            <p> A small rally is taking place, with picket signs. Kathleen<br>
              is standing on a small speaker's platform, along with the<br>
              Borough President.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              My mother used to say to me that every<br>
              book you sell is a gift from the<br>
              heart...</p>
            <p> EXT. FOXBOOKS - DAY</p>
            <p> As 20 CHILDREN march in front of the store, holding little<br>
              makeshift picket signs and singing songs. &quot;One, two, three,<br>
              four, we don't want this Superstore.&quot;</p>
            <p> Customers go right through the line and into the store.</p>
            <p> INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY</p>
            <p> We can hear the pickets marching and singing outside --<br>
              although the store is full of customers anyway. The Fox men<br>
              -- Joe, Nelson and Schuyler -- are sitting in the cafe.<br>
              Nelson is holding a copy of a weekly newspaper, which has the<br>
              old high-school yearbook picture of William Spungeon on the<br>
              front page and a headline: William Spungeon Emerges from<br>
              Hiding to Support Bookstore.</p>
            <p> SCHUYLER<br>
              Who is this Spungeon anyway?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              He's a writer.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              Well, I've never heard of him. And<br>
              neither has anyone else in this place.</p>
            <p> INT. TV SET - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As we see SIDNEY-ANN STRONGIN, a young and attractive PBS<br>
              talk show hostess for a show called Inside Media.</p>
            <p> SIDNEY-ANN<br>
              The New York Literary world was shocked<br>
              this week when William Spungeon, the most<br>
              famously reclusive author since J.D.<br>
              Salinger, announced that he was coming<br>
              out of hiding because of his loyalty to a<br>
              small children's bookstore on the West<br>
              Side of Manhattan. Discussing this<br>
              tonight is a man I happen to think of as<br>
              one of this city's most underappreciated<br>
              assets, Frank Navasky.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> SIDNEY-ANN<br>
              This all happened because of you, didn't<br>
              it --</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Well, I knew William Spungeon loved<br>
              children's books so I wrote a provocative<br>
              column --</p>
            <p> SIDNEY-ANN<br>
              Your specialty.</p>
            <p> Frank laughs. Sidney-Ann laughs.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              And it kind of smoked him out.</p>

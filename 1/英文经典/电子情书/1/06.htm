            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As Kathleen and Frank get into bed.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              I really like Patricia Eden. She's a<br>
              very nice person.</p>
            <p> Kathleen doesn't respond. Frank turns out the light.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              She needs educating, that's all.</p>
            <p> A beat.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              She's hopelessly driven by money and<br>
              power, but there's a hope for anyone <br>
              who's that familiar with my work --</p>
            <p> On Kathleen, as she turns away from Frank and lies there,<br>
              eyes open.</p>
            <p> INT. JOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As Joe and Patricia get into bed. Brinkley is already on the<br>
              bed.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              I had no idea that Frank Navasky was so<br>
              down-to-earth.</p>
            <p> Joe doesn't respond. Patricia turns out the light.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              You read his stuff, you think he's going<br>
              to be so obscure and abstruse.</p>
            <p> A beat.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA (cont'd)<br>
              He's always talking about Heidigger and<br>
              Foucault and I have no idea what any of<br>
              it's about, really.</p>
            <p> Joe gets up. Brinkley follows.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA (cont'd)<br>
              Where are you going?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I'm not really tired.</p>
            <p> INT. JOE'S DEN - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Joe writes on his computer. Brinkley on the floor next to him.</p>
            <p> And cut between Joe and his computer screen.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              Do you ever feel you become the worst<br>
              version of yourself? That a Pandora's<br>
              Box of all the secret hateful parts --<br>
              your arrogance, your spite, your<br>
              condescension -- has sprung open.<br>
              Someone provokes you, and instead of <br>
              just smiling and moving on, you zing <br>
              them. Hello, it's Mr. Nasty. I'm sure <br>
              you have no idea what I'm talking about.</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY</p>
            <p> And cut between screen and</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> As Kathleen reads the end of Joe's letter.</p>
            <p> Kathleen hits the Reply key and starts to type:</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              I know what you mean and I'm completely<br>
              jealous. What happens to me when I'm<br>
              provoked is that I get tongue-tied. My<br>
              mind goes blank. Then I spend all night<br>
              tossing and turning trying to think of<br>
              what I should have said.</p>
            <p> INT. JOE'S COMPUTER SCREEN AND JOE'S DEN - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As he replies:</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              Wouldn't it be wonderful if I could pass<br>
              all my zingers to you and then I would<br>
              never behave badly and you could behave<br>
              badly all the time and we'd both be<br>
              happy? On the other hand, I must warn<br>
              you that when you finally have the<br>
              pleasure of saying the thing you mean to<br>
              say at the moment you mean to say it,<br>
              remorse inevitably follows. Do you think<br>
              we should meet?</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S COMPUTER SCREEN AND BEDROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Kathleen stares at Joe's letter in her computer.</p>
            <p> She's frozen.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Meet? Omigod.</p>
            <p> She sits staring at the letter. She has no idea what to do.</p>
            <p> EXT. 75TH STREET &amp; COLUMBUS - DAY</p>
            <p> As the iron gates on all the stores start to open, just the<br>
              way we saw them open in the opening sequence of the movie.<br>
              The pharmacy. The optician. The cosmetics supply store.<br>
              The video store.</p>
            <p> And now, finally, we see the new grate on the new Foxbooks<br>
              Superstore start to open upwards. This is the finest grate<br>
              on Broadway, no question of it. It's electric and almost<br>
              soundless. We see a sign saying, OPENING DAY. 35% OFF ON<br>
              ALL BEST-SELLERS.</p>
            <p> People on the street notice the store. One walks in...</p>
            <p> CAMERA follows him...</p>
            <p> INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY</p>
            <p> The inside is beautiful. Gleaning staircase, a cafe,<br>
              comfortable chairs to sit, a bank of cashiers, everyone<br>
              decked out in gray alligator shirts with a fox where the<br>
              alligator should be, a rope for the checkout line, and seven<br>
              cash registers with seven cashiers. Of course, books, books,<br>
              books, as far as the eye can see.</p>
            <p> MATCH DISSOLVE TO:</p>
            <p> INT. SAME SCENE - LATER THAT DAY</p>
            <p> The store is jam-packed. Joe with his father Nelson, his<br>
              grandfather Schuyler, and Kevin, the store manager.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              No pickets, no demonstrations.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              The neighborhood loves us.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              They're wondering where we've been all<br>
              these years. They're wondering how they<br>
              ever did without it.</p>
            <p> SCHUYLER<br>
              It's a hit.</p>
            <p> They admire their own store, walk through the downstairs and<br>
              start up the staircase to the second floor.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              How's the children's book department?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              It's early yet. School isn't out. And<br>
              there's that children's bookstore nearby<br>
              --</p>
            <p> SCHUYLER<br>
              Cecilia's store --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Her daughter's --</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              We'll crush it --</p>
            <p> SCHUYLER<br>
              She was enchanting.</p>
            <p> And as they walk on upstairs, several mothers with children<br>
              come up the stairs behind them.</p>
            <p> EXT. BROADWAY - MORNING</p>
            <p> A little group of children dressed as Pilgrims walk down the<br>
              street as Kathleen comes around the corner to buy her morning<br>
              paper. Joe is at the newsstand. She turns and pretends to<br>
              be staring at a wall until he finishes buying his paper and<br>
              walks on.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              I don't think it's a good idea for us<br>
              to meet...</p>
            <p> INT. STARBUCKS - ANOTHER DAY</p>
            <p> Joe is putting sugar into his coffee at the sugar counter as<br>
              Kathleen comes in. He pretends he didn't see her.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)<br>
              I love our relationship. There's a lot<br>
              going on in the day-to-dayness of my life<br>
              and there's something magical...</p>
            <p> INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK</p>
            <p> We see Kathleen and George at the end of the day, counting<br>
              the receipts. Birdie is using a calculator to total them.<br>
              Christina is shelving books. There are Thanksgiving<br>
              decorations -- cardboard turkeys and pilgrims, books on<br>
              colonists like Myles Standish.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)<br>
              ... and thrilling about this island in<br>
              cyberspace I have with you. SO PLEASE<br>
              DON'T ASK ME AGAIN.</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              About $1200 less than the same week last<br>
              year.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              That could be a fluke, right?</p>
            <p> They look at each other.</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              Or not.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Their store is new. It's a novelty. But<br>
              it will all shake out. Do you think I<br>
              should put up more twinkle lights?</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              That's a lovely idea.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              What if we have to fold? I'll never find<br>
              another part time job and I won't be able<br>
              to pay the rent and I'll have to move to<br>
              Brooklyn.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              The joy of rent control. Six room for<br>
              $450 a month.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              We know. You've told us a million times.<br>
              I can't believe you're bringing it up at<br>
              a time like this. It's like bragging<br>
              because you're tall. Birdie never brags<br>
              about her rent and she pays even less<br>
              than you.</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              Ten rooms. I just rattle around from one<br>
              to the other.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Hey, guys. We are not going to fold.</p>
            <p> The door opens, and Meredith Carter, the woman George had<br>
              swooned over in front of his building, walks in.</p>
            <p> George stares, frozen in place, as she walks up to him.</p>
            <p> MEREDITH<br>
              George Pappas?</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              (I have died and gone to heaven)<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> MEREDITH<br>
              (flashing her badge)<br>
              Detective Carter, 23rd precinct. I'd<br>
              like to ask you a few questions.</p>
            <p> Kathleen suddenly sees George, following Meredith out of the<br>
              store. He's in a complete daze.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              George? Where are you going?</p>
            <p> He goes out the door.</p>
            <p> LAURA MARGULIES, a well-known children's book author, enters<br>
              as George leaves.</p>
            <p> LAURA<br>
              Kathleen, are you surviving?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Laura! We're so excited about your new<br>
              book. When should we schedule your<br>
              signing?</p>
            <p> LAURA<br>
              Oh, it's being published in January.<br>
              Are you going to be in business in<br>
              January? I'm so worried.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              We're doing great, aren't we?</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Great.</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              No difference whatsoever.</p>
            <p> LAURA<br>
              Thank God. Well, you know you can count<br>
              on me. For anything, support, rallies.<br>
              Picket lines. We can get the Times to<br>
              write something. Or that nut in the<br>
              Independent --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              What nut in the Independent?</p>
            <p> LAURA<br>
              Frank Navasky. This is just the sort of<br>
              thing that would outrage him.</p>
            <p> She smiles brightly.</p>
            <p> INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY</p>
            <p> George and Meredith are sitting in a booth.</p>
            <p> MEREDITH<br>
              Mr. Pappas, I'm investigating the murder<br>
              of the woman found on the roof of your<br>
              building. Do you live alone there?</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Do I live alone? Yes I do. Do you live<br>
              alone?</p>
            <p> MEREDITH<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> George takes her hand in his and looks at it as if it were<br>
              the eighth wonder of the world. He starts stroking it,<br>
              caressing it...</p>
            <p> Meredith pulls it away. A beat. Then she gives it right<br>
              back to him. He continues stroking. They stare at each<br>
              other. He puts her fingers into his mouth.</p>
            <p> MEREDITH<br>
              (overwhelmed)<br>
              What are you doing?</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              I don't know. I have no idea.</p>
            <p> MEREDITH<br>
              You have to stop.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              I can't.</p>
            <p> She utters a little moan.</p>

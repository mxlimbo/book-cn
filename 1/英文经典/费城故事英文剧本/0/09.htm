            <p>Andrew and his immediate family are gathered in the den, sitting 
              quietly, facing each other. Andrew's father, BUD, with an American 
              flag pin in his lapel, sits next to Sarah. Jill holds the hand of 
              her husband, REVEREND JIM. Two of Andrew's brothers,<br>
              MATT and RANDY, (big, athletic guys with mustaches) are there.</p>
            <p>Andrew sits next to Miguel.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Things might be said, at the trial, that... are not going to be 
              easy for you to hear. Things about me, about my private life. And 
              I want to make sure it's<br>
              okay with everybody.</p>
            <p> MATT<br>
              I appreciate you asking, Andy, but really, it's your call.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              What do you think, Jill?</p>
            <p> JILL<br>
              To be honest, I'm worried about Mommy and Daddy. They've had to 
              go through so much already...<br>
              And, we all know...<br>
              (very difficult to say)<br>
              There's going to be even worse things to deal with, eventually. 
              I wonder if it's fair to put<br>
              them through this.</p>
            <p>Andrew's father STARES at his folded hands.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Mom?</p>
            <p> SARAH<br>
              All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. 
              But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't 
              expect any of<br>
              my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Thanks, Mom... Dad?</p>
            <p>There's a pause before Bud Beckett speaks.</p>
            <p> BUD<br>
              Supposedly, the Lord doesn't give you more trouble than you can 
              handle. But I'm having a hard time believing that these days.</p>
            <p>Andrew's construction worker brother, RANDY, wipes tears from his 
              eyes. Clearly their father is in alot of pain.</p>
            <p> BUD (CONT.)<br>
              Andy, the way you've faced this whole thing, you and Miguel, with 
              so much courage... your mother and<br>
              I have been so very impressed...</p>
            <p>Andrew gazes at his father with incredible love. Miguel puts an 
              arm around Andrew.</p>
            <p> BUD (CONT.)<br>
              I can't imagine there is anything, that anyone could say, that would 
              make us feel less proud of you.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (full of emotion)<br>
              Thanks, Dad. I love you guys. How about you, Randy?</p>
            <p> RANDY<br>
              Hey. You're my kid brother, Andy. That's the bottom line. I mean, 
              what are those bastards going to say?<br>
              You're gay? Shit, I knew that when you were five years old.</p>
            <p>Everyone LAUGHS. Andrew and Randy high five.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              Wait a minute...<br>
              (to Andrew)<br>
              You're gay?</p>
            <p>More laughter. But Jill speaks seriously:</p>
            <p> JILL<br>
              What about you, Andy? You're not a militant type. You've always 
              been so private.</p>
            <p>CLOSE ON ANDREW:</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I guess... I don't have time for that any more.</p>
            <p> SARAH<br>
              Jim? Will you lead us in a prayer?</p>
            <p>Everyone bows heads, holding hands in a circle.</p>
            <p> REVEREND JIM<br>
              Dear Lord. Sometimes it is difficult to remember to be grateful...</p>
            <p>CAMERA PANS THE CIRCLE, THE PRAYING FACES.</p>
            <p> REVEREND JIM (CONT.)<br>
              To remember, in our times of sorrow and confusion, that we have 
              You to turn to, and each other. Bless and keep Andrew and Miguel, 
              dear Lord, deepen<br>
              and strengthen their love as they face the struggles that lay ahead. 
              Bless and watch over all of us, fill us with Your love, Your light, 
              and Your peace,<br>
              which passeth all understanding. In Jesus' name, we pray...</p>

              Amen.</p>

            <p>BECKETTS' LIVINGROOM, SEEN THROUGH THE VIDEO CAMERA (DAY) ...</p>
            <p>A local entertainer (GUIDO PAONESSA) launches into a<br>
              standard, accompanied by a single guitar player, and Bud and Sarah 
              begin to dance, surrounded by family and friends.</p>
            <p> GUIDO<br>
              &quot;After all the days of Spring have flown...&quot;</p>
            <p>VIDEO CAMERA PANS: RELATIVES eating cake, KIDS chasing each other, 
              a GRANDMOTHER in a wheelchair holding a NEWBORN, watching silent, 
              video home movies.</p>
            <p>CAMERA FINDS Andrew and Niguel eating anniversary cake (Andrew 
              barely touches his). Playing for the camera, Miguel dips his finger 
              into icing and smears it onto Andrew's nose. Andrew tries to reach 
              the icing with his tongue.</p>
            <p>CAMERA PANS WITH ANDREW as he comes forward to dance with his mother, 
              while Jill dances with their father.</p>
            <p>CAMERA RETURNS TO MIGUEL. MATT (behind the camera) says:</p>
            <p> MATT (OS)<br>
              Hey, Miguel, can you imagine any two people being together for forty 
              years?</p>
            <p>ZOOM IN CLOSE ON NIGUEL (who's watching Andrew):</p>

              No one will break down on the stand with a tearful confession...</p>
            <p>REVERSE ON JOE, ADDRESSING THE JURY.</p>
            <p> JOE (CONT.)<br>
              You are presented with a simple fact: Andrew Beckett was fired. 
              You will hear two explanations for<br>
              why he was fired. Ours. And theirs...</p>
            <p>Joe crosses the courtroom, coming to stand in front of...</p>
            <p>ANDREW, whose appearance has changed: thinner, paler than we've 
              ever seen him, some blisters on his lips. But the most disturbing 
              thing about his appearance is the way he moves, slowly, like a much 
              older man. He's taking notes (which he will do relentlessly throughout 
              the trial.) And he has a cane at his<br>
              side, which he'll use throughout the trial.</p>
            <p> JOE (CONT.)<br>
              It's up to you, to sift through layer and layer of truth, and determine 
              for yourselves the version that sounds the most true.</p>
            <p>Charles Wheeler, Walter Kenton, Bob Seidman, Kenneth Killcoyne 
              sit BEHIND their lawyers, Belinda Conine and Jerome Green, and SEVERAL 
              ASSISTANTS at the defense table.</p>
            <p>JUDGE GARNETT presides from his bench.</p>
            <p>Among the spectators, Miguel sits next to Sarah, and<br>
              Andrew's sister Jill. AIDS ACTIVISTS in the background.</p>
            <p> JOE (CONT.)<br>
              There are certain points in our version, that I must prove to you... 
              Point number one: Andrew<br>
              Beckett was... is a brilliant lawyer. A great lawyer. Point number 
              two. Andrew Beckett, afflicted with a debilitating disease, made 
              the legal, understandable, personal choice to keep the fact of his 
              illness to himself... Point number three:<br>
              His employers discovered his illness. And ladies and gentlemen, 
              the illness I'm referring to, is AIDS...</p>
            <p>Joe pauses, letting that sink in.</p>
            <p> JOE (CONT.)<br>
              Point number four. They panicked. And, in their panic, they did 
              what most of us would like to do with AIDS... Get it, and the people 
              who have it, as far away from us as possible.</p>
            <p>Joe walks away from Andrew.</p>
            <p> JOE (CONT.)<br>
              The behavior of Andrew Beckett's employers may seem reasonable to 
              you. It does to me. After all, AIDS<br>
              is a deadly, incurable, disease...</p>
            <p>CLOSE ON MEMBERS OF THE JURY.</p>
            <p> JOE (CONT.)<br>
              But however you come to judge the behavior of Charles Wheeler and 
              his partners in moral, ethical,<br>
              human terms... When they fired Andrew Beckett because he had AIDS, 
              they broke the law.</p>
            <p>With a swift, direct glance at the Judge, Joe speaks with considerable 
              power and emotion:</p>
            <p> JOE (CONT.)<br>
              And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect 
              for the law, when that day comes,<br>
              our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our 
              children and grandchildren will<br>
              live like savages.</p>

            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. 
              Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... 
              Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew 
              Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal 
              his disease from them.<br>
              Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant 
              Wheeler did not know Andrew<br>
              Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...</p>

            <p>Andrew looks directly at Belinda.</p>

              Fact. Andrew Beckett is dying.</p>
            <p>Joe watches Andrew for his reaction.</p>
            <p> BELINDA (CONT.)<br>
              Fact. Andrew Beckett is angry. Because his &quot;lifestyle,&quot; 
              his reckless behavior, has cut short<br>
              his life... And in his anger, his rage, he's lashing out. And he

            <p> JOE<br>
              Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is 
              that correct?</p>
            <p> LAIRD<br>
              Wyant Wheeler represented us.</p>
            <p>Andrew glances toward the jury box: the MARINE JUROR writes in 
              a tiny notebook.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.</p>
            <p> LAIRD<br>
              That's correct.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Were you pleased with his work?</p>
            <p> LAIRD<br>
              We were satisfied.</p>
            <p>Joe and Andrew exchange a LOOK -- Laird's response surprises and 
              disappoints them.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Were you satisfied, or were you pleased?</p>
            <p>Laird glances toward Charles Wheeler before answering.</p>
            <p> LAIRD<br>
              We were satisfied.</p>
            <p>Joe refers to legal documents.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, 
              and you agreed, you gave<br>
              sworn testimony in a deposition.<br>
              Is that correct?</p>
            <p> LAIRD<br>
              That's correct.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              According to the deposition, you said you were &quot;thrilled, impressed, 
              overwhelmed&quot; by the quality of<br>
              Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?</p>
            <p> LAIRD<br>
              I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at 
              this moment.</p>
            <p>Joe takes on a street-tough tone:</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did 
              Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit<br>
              for you or not?</p>
            <p> LAIRD<br>
              We won.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?</p>
            <p> LAIRD<br>
              It satisfied me.</p>
            <p>Joe STARES at the guy.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A 
              cheeseburger may be satisfying<br>
              whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for 
              dessert might be considered<br>
              overwhelming. Do you agree?</p>
            <p> LAIRD<br>
              I might.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now 
              you're calling him a cheeseburger.<br>
              Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why 
              you've changed your mind.</p>
            <p> LAIRD<br>
              Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's 
              how I feel now.</p>

            <p> JEROME GREEN<br>
              Does the supervising attorney guide the litigating attorney during

              Often, he does.</p>
            <p> JEROME GREEN<br>
              As far as you know, in the handling of your lawsuit, Andrew Beckett 
              was simply following orders.</p>
            <p> LAIRD<br>
              That's a fair assessment of the situation.</p>
            <p>Andrew glances over his shoulder: at Robert Seidman, who meets

            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>ANDREW AT WORK IN THE FIRM'S LIBRARY (INT./NIGHT) ...</p>
            <p>Andrew's fingers FLY across the keys of a notebook computer.</p>
            <p>Needing a reference, he shoves his rolling chair away from the 
              computer... opens a reference book... grabs a carton of Chinese 
              food... (NOTE: The library may be equipped with a computer terminal 
              which Andrew uses for reference, rather than a book.)</p>
            <p>Andrew eats sauteed string beans with chopsticks, finding a relevant 
              citation:</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Ah hah! Yes!<br>
              (chewing a string bean)<br>
              Rentworth v. Pennsylvania... court of appeals affirms jury award 
              of punitive damages for<br>
              wrongful interference with prospective economic<br>
              relations...</p>
            <p>A SHADOW falls across Andrew. He IGNORES IT.</p>
            <p>ANGLE: TWO MEN IN SILHOUETTE. WALTER KENTON says:</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              Look at this fucking guy. He's an animal.</p>
            <p>Andrew's hands DO NOT LEAVE the keyboard.</p>
            <p> ANDREW Walter.</p>
            <p>The SECOND MAN steps forward, a silhouette becoming visible This 
              is BOB SEIDMAN. He and Kenton wear tuxedos.</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              Are we interrupting, Andy?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              In a word, Bob...</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              Charles is right behind me.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER SILHOUETTED FIGURE APPEARS. This image has a<br>
              horror-film feeling to it.</p>
            <p>Andrew WHIPS AROUND to face them.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I was just about to take a break. Good evening, Charles.</p>
            <p>CHARLES WHEELER, also in tuxedo, remains in shadow.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Andy? Could you step into my office for a sec?<br>
              (deadpan)<br>
              I feel like firing someone tonight.</p>
            <p>Andrew throws an arm over Seidman's shoulder.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              We're gonna miss you around here, Bob...</p>
            <p> CUT ON LAUGHTER TO:</p>
            <p>THE RECEPTION AREA (INT./NIGHT): A DOMINO'S PIZZA DELIVERY<br>
              MAN, waiting for clearance from a SECURITY GUARD, on<br>
              Andrew's dim and quiet floor, WATCHES AS...</p>
            <p>Seidman, Kenton and Andrew follow Charles Wheeler up a wide, carpeted 
              staircase. Wheeler finishes a story and everyone LAUGHS...</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>A BOX OF CIGARS BEING HANDED AROUND (INT./NIGHT) ...</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              Andy's expressed a keen interest in the Kronos Inc. situation, Charles. 
              Is that correct, Andy?</p>
            <p>The lawyers have gathered in Wheeler's spacious office, with its 
              floor-to-ceiling view of the Philadelphia skyline.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              The fate of the participants interests me, yes sir.</p>
            <p>Wheeler, Kenton and Seidman proceed with the male ritual of preparing 
              cigars to be smoked: snipping the ends with a brass clip, rolling 
              them over their tongues to wet them, sliding the cigars in and out 
              of their rounded mouths.</p>
            <p>Andrew, holding a cigar but NOT preparing to light it, watches 
              with a not completely concealed twinkle in his eye.</p>
            <p>Wheeler leans back in his chair, swirling a brandy snifter. He 
              exhales cigar smoke with a great deal of pleasure.</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              It's good to be King, hey Charles?</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent 
              tyrant.<br>
              (prompting Andrew)<br>
              It's an anti-trust action.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies 
              all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're 
              allowed to<br>
              sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, 
              the legal principle, involved is<br>
              copyright infringement.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of<br>
              MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side 
              of this mess would you desire to be<br>
              on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with 
              Bill to influence your answer in<br>
              any way.</p>
            <p>Andrew knows this is a test. And he loves it.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Sorry, Charles, but...</p>
            <p>Andrew is distracted -- BY A LIGHT FALLING ACROSS HIS FACE.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              I'd like to see Kronos win.</p>
            <p>Walter Kenton has shifted a lamp, so that its LIGHT FALLS ACROSS 
              ANDREW'S FACE, REVEALING: a faint purple blotch about the size of 
              a quarter, much like the blotches we saw on the HISPANIC PATIENT 
              in Andrew's doctor's office.</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              Why, Beckett?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Because they deserve to, Walter.</p>
            <p>Andrew lifts his hand, finding that his hair has been pushed back, 
              revealing the blotch.</p>
            <p>He stands, nonchalantly running a hand through his hair to cover 
              the blotch.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, 
              five thousand Americans will be<br>
              out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were 
              enacted to prevent exactly the<br>
              kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Bailey, Brackman.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Get with the program, Andy. As of this evening, about 8:05 this 
              evening, right after the soup<br>
              course... Kronos Incorporated is represented by Wyant Wheeler Hellerman 
              Tetlow and Brown. Or,<br>
              more specifically, senior associate Andrew Beckett.</p>
            <p>A moment before it sinks in, then: Andrew clenches his fist in 
              a victory salute.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Yes!</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute 
              of limitations.</p>
            <p>An ASSOCIATE LAWYER in shirtsleeves taps on the office door.ASSOCIATE 
              LAWYER Tokyo on four, Bob.</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              Great. Excuse me, fellas.<br>
              (picking up a phone, speaking Japanese)<br>
              Connichiwa. Itsumo osewa ni nari mashita. Arigato gozaimasu.</p>
            <p>Andrew offers his hand to Walter Kenton.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Thanks, Walter.</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              What's that on your forehead, pal?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Whacked with a racquetball.<br>
              (taking Wheeler's hand)<br>
              I appreciate your faith in my abilities.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Faith, Andy, is the belief in something for which we have no evidence. 
              It doesn't apply to this situation.<br>
              (slapping his shoulder)<br>
              Go home. I mean, get back to work.</p>
            <p>Andrew and Wheeler are eye-to-eye, an intimate moment.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (warmly, softly)<br>
              Thanks, Charles.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              (with a father's affection)<br>
              No sweat, buddy.</p>
            <p>Smiling, Andrew exits the office.</p>
            <p>CLOSE ON WALTER KENTON, THINKING...</p>
            <p> CONTINUOUS CUT TO:</p>
            <p>ANDREW STEPPING INTO THE EMPTY CORRIDOR, TAKING A FEW STEPS away 
              from Wheeler's office (INT./NIGHT), then...... DOING a JOYFUL END 
              ZONE DANCE, running in place the way football players do when then 
              score a touch down, saying &quot;Yes! Yes! Yes!&quot; to himself, 
              soundlessly.</p>
            <p>The SOUND OF CLANGING METAL interrupts Andrew: HELENA, a maintenance 
              worker is emptying a trash can. She's seen his little dance and 
              starts to laugh.</p>
            <p>Smiling, Andrew puts the unlit cigar into his mouth, WINKS at Helena 
              and says:</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (in a funny, kind of medieval way)<br>
              It's good to be King.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>ESTABLISHING: ANDREW'S LOFT BUILDING (EXT. DAY)</p>
            <p>TITLE: &quot;Ten days later.&quot;</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>CLOSE ON ANDREW'S FACE MARKED WITH FOUR BLOTCHES (WE'RE IN Andrew's 
              loft -- INT./DAY) </p>
            <p>It's a mirror image. The BLOTCHES vary from the size of a dime, 
              to the size of a half-dollar. He looks awful.</p>
            <p>A YOUNG, BLACK WOMAN'S FINGER applies makeup to Andrew's face, 
              trying to cover the blotches. This is his friend CHANDRA.</p>
            <p> CHANDRA (O.S.)<br>
              You want to apply the foundation as evenly as you can, Andy. You 
              don't want to look like you've<br>
              thrown it on with a spoon.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (O.S.)<br>
              Uh huh.</p>
            <p>CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING Andrew sitting at a table in his loft, 
              a towel around his neck, protecting his shirt from makeup. Chandra 
              applies the makeup gently, supervised by another friend<br>
              named ALAN. (Andrew's loft has been turned into a lawyer's command 
              post: stacks of books, documents, etc.). A third friend, BRUNO, 
              sits in the corner, flipping through channels on the TV.</p>
            <p> CHANDRA<br>
              Okay. You try.</p>
            <p>Andrew tries applying makeup to his face.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Chandra? Don't you think this color's a little... orange for me?</p>
            <p> CHANDRA<br>
              Tahitian Bronze works best on lesions.</p>
            <p> ALAN<br>
              Think of it as the &quot;I just back from Aruba&quot; look.</p>
            <p>IN THE BACKGROUND: Andrew's fax machine receives a fax in Andrew's 
              &quot;work area&quot;: desk, personal computer, etc.).</p>
            <p> BRUNO<br>
              I got it.</p>
            <p>Bruno removes the fax from the machine, walking it over to Andrew, 
              handing Andrew the fax, while munching an apple.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (giving the fax a quick scan)<br>
              Thanks, Bruno.<br>
              (to Alan and Chandra)<br>
              I've been out of the office four days. I don't want them to think 
              I've been to the beach.<br>
              (searching for something)<br>
              Okay. Check this out.</p>
            <p>Andrew puts on a pair of big glasses with tortoise shell frames, 
              meant to help conceal the blotches.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              Hides everything, right? What do you think?</p>
            <p> CHANDRA<br>
              You know who you look like, Andy? That actor, in that movie. Not 
              the one where he was autistic, the one where he dressed up like 
              a lady on a soap<br>
              opera...</p>
            <p> ALAN<br>
              Dustin Hoffman.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (horrified)<br>
              Tootsie!</p>
            <p> BRUNO<br>
              Right.</p>
            <p> CHANDRA<br>
              You want to try Light Egyptian?</p>
            <p>Suddenly, Andrew winces, gripping his gut.</p>
            <p> CHANDRA (CONT.)<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (clearly in pain)<br>
              Excuse me a sec...</p>
            <p>Andrew starts out of the room -- suddenly HAVING TO RUN.</p>
            <p> CHANDRA<br>
              Just like my cousin Fredo.</p>
            <p>CAMERA HOLDS ON Chandra, Alan and Bruno. SOUND OF BATHROOM DOOR 
              slamming shut.</p>
            <p>Bruno saunters across the room and knocks on the bathroom door.</p>
            <p> BRUNO<br>
              You okay, Andy?</p>

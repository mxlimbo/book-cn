              &quot;Angela, we're standing in Philadelphia, the City of<br>
              Brotherly Love, the birthplace of freedom, where our Founding Fathers 
              authored the Declaration of Independence. And I don't remember that 
              glorious document saying &quot;All straight men are created equal.&quot; 
              I could have sworn it says, &quot;All men are created equal.&quot;</p>

            <p>ON THE TV SCREEN: The REPORTER wraps up her story.</p>
            <p> REPORTER MEDINA<br>
              &quot;This case is sending a cold chill through the legal community. 
              One of Wyant Wheeler's key clients, the<br>
              Grace Foster Foundation, which supports several AIDS charities, 
              has taken its business to another firm until this matter is resolved...&quot;</p>
            <p>As the TV DRONES ON, CHARLIE THE COP, OTHERS GLARE at Joe.</p>
            <p> FILKO<br>
              (chuckles)<br>
              Hey, Joe.<br>
              (a wink to the COP)<br>
              You're not starting to get a little... light on your feet here on 
              us, are you?</p>
            <p>Joe does not laugh.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Yeah, Filko. I am.<br>
              (stepping toward Filko)<br>
              I'm on the prowl, Filko. I need a man. Not just any man. I need 
              a hunk. A hunk like you. How about it, Filko? Want to play sailor? 
              This time, I'll be first<br>
              mate and you can be Columbus.</p>
            <p> FILKO<br>
              Chill out, Joe.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              (angry)<br>
              Those people make me sick, Filko! But a law's been<br>
              broken, okay? The law. Remember the law?</p>
            <p>CHARLIE THE COP has relaxed a bit.</p>
            <p> CHARLIE THE COP<br>
              At least we agree on one thing, Joe... They make me sick too.</p>
            <p>HOLD ON JOE, but WE HEAR THE TV REPORTER in the BACKGROUND:</p>
            <p> TV REPORTER MEDINA<br>
              &quot;... now the public knows that your son has AIDS and he's gay. 
              How does that make you feel?&quot;</p>
            <p>All eyes turn to the TV: SARAH BECKETT IN CLOSE UP.</p>
            <p> SARAH<br>
              &quot;This is a world full of war, famine, poverty, homelessness... 
              and people make a fuss because<br>
              two men or two women want to live together, or make love. Seems 
              kind of silly, doesn't it?&quot;</p>
            <p>The bar ERUPTS with a CHORUS OF BOOS AND CATCALLS.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>JOE ADDRESSING A WITNESS IN COURT (INT./DAY) ...</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              And Walter Kenton knew the lesions on your face and arms were caused 
              by AIDS?</p>
            <p>The witness: MARIA TORRES, Hispanic, 35, healthy-looking.</p>
            <p> MARIA<br>
              Definitely. People were going around, whispering things. I figured 
              I didn't have anything<br>
              to lose, so I told all the partners.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              How did Walter Kenton treat you, after you told him you had AIDS?</p>
            <p>CLOSE ON KENTON, looking confident.</p>
            <p> MARIA<br>
              Every time he came into contact with me, he'd get this look on his 
              face. I called it, the &quot;Oh God&quot; expression. As in &quot;Oh 
              God, here comes that woman with AIDS.&quot;</p>
            <p>Andrew LAUGHS.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Ms. Torres? Have your employers fired you for having AIDS?</p>
            <p> MARIA<br>
              No. When I need time off, for medical reasons, we work it out.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Thank you. No more questions.</p>
            <p>Jerome Green rises.</p>
            <p> JEROME GREEN<br>
              Miss Torres. How did you contract the AIDS virus?</p>
            <p> MARIA<br>
              During a transfusion. I lost a lot of blood giving birth to my second 
              child.</p>
            <p> JEROME GREEN<br>
              In other words, in your case you happen to be an innocent victim 
              of the AIDS tragedy.</p>
            <p> MARIA<br>
              Look. I'm no different from everyone else who has this disease: 
              I'm not guilty, I'm not innocent. I'm just trying to survive.</p>
            <p> QUICK CUT TO:</p>
            <p>JOE, APPROACHING A WITNESS (INT./DAY) ...</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Beyond noticing the marks on his face, were there other things about 
              his appearance that made you suspect he had AIDS?</p>
            <p>THE WITNESS: Paralegal Anthea Burton.</p>
            <p> ANTHEA<br>
              He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he 
              was working so hard... Still, I<br>
              felt something was wrong.<br>
              (looking at Wheeler)<br>
              And I can't believe they're saying they didn't notice anything.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Objection.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              Just answer the question.</p>
            <p> ANTHEA<br>
              Sorry.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Ms. Burton. You're black.</p>
            <p> ANTHEA<br>
              Is that a question?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?</p>
            <p> ANTHEA<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p>Wheeler shakes his head, disgusted. Kenton fumes, outraged. Seidman 
              looks surprised.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              In what way?</p>
            <p> ANTHEA<br>
              Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler 
              had a problem with my earrings.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Your earrings?</p>
            <p>Anthea is wearing large, dangling African-style earrings.</p>
            <p> ANTHEA<br>
              Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... &quot;ethnic&quot; 
              is the word she used. She said he<br>
              would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more 
              &quot;American.&quot;</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What did you say?</p>
            <p> ANTHEA<br>
              I said my earrings are American. They're African-American.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Thank you. No more questions.</p>
            <p>Belinda Conine approaches Anthea.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?</p>
            <p> ANTHEA<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Were you recently promoted?</p>
            <p> ANTHEA<br>
              Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Thank you.</p>

              Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone

            <p> TO:</p>
            <p>TWO STORY HIGH CORRIDORS THAT REEK OF HISTORY (INT-DAY).</p>
            <p>Young lawyer JAMEY COLLINS darts through the crowd, carrying an 
              accordion file under his arm like a football.</p>
            <p>Jamey elbows his way through a JAPANESE TOUR GROUP.</p>
            <p>Jamey trots up a marble staircase, two steps at a time</p>
            <p> TO:</p>
            <p>JAMEY RUNS LIKE HELL DOWN A THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR, FOOTSTEPS<br>
              making a racket...</p>
            <p>Jamey rushes toward a door marked &quot;JUDGE TATE.&quot;</p>
            <p>RAISED VOICES from inside Judge Tate's chambers:</p>
            <p> JOSEPH MILLER (OS)<br>
              This construction site is causing mortal and irreparable harm to 
              an unsuspecting public!</p>
            <p> ANDREW BECKETT (OS)<br>
              My client has one of the finest and most respected safety records 
              in the business, Your Honor!</p>
            <p>Jamey shoves open the door, REVEALING TWO LAWYERS (BACKS TO CAMERA) 
              STANDING BEFORE JUDGE EUNICE TATE: ANDREW BECKETT (in conservative 
              gray) and JOSEPH MILLER (in pinstripes).</p>
            <p> JUDGE TATE<br>
              One at a time. Mr. Miller?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding 
              residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, 
              germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe 
              known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily 
              basis to add their<br>
              voices of outrage!</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began 
              knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor 
              refers to,<br>
              has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined 
              and the results...</p>
            <p>Behind his back, Andrew wiggles his fingers. Jamey stuffs a document 
              into Andrew's hand.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              Limestone. Messy, but innocuous.</p>
            <p>Andrew submits the report to the Judge.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Innocuous?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Defined by Webster's as harmless.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how the children in this 
              neighborhood have been<br>
              made to feel. The pounding of construction ringing in their ears 
              as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting 
              an ominous<br>
              shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are 
              surrounded in a black, toxic<br>
              fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! And Counselor 
              calls it harmless?!</p>
            <p>His back turned momentarily to the JUDGE, Andrew mouths to Jamey: 
              &quot;Not bad.&quot; But he whips around, serious again:</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Your Honor, Counselor is attempting to portray my client as a hideous 
              manifestation of evil and corruption. But nothing could be further 
              from<br>
              the truth. Rockwell has generously contributed ten<br>
              thousand dollars to this neighborhood's schools, clinics and youth 
              centers! Granting a<br>
              restraining order on the construction site will throw hundreds of 
              Philadelphians out of work, and will lend validation to this contemptible 
              and groundless nuisance suit, which speaks directly to the kind 
              of greed and treachery that today is threatening the very fabric 
              of our society.</p>
            <p>Judge Tate looks skeptically at both lawyers.</p>
            <p> JUDGE TATE<br>
              Let's not go off the deep end, gentlemen. I thought we were talking 
              about some dust.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>A MAN ON CRUTCHES HOBBLES INTO A COURTHOUSE ELEVATOR AND IS joined 
              by Andrew and Joe, crowding inside (INT./DAY) ...</p>
            <p>As soon as the doors close, Andrew whips out a micro- cassette 
              recorder, making notes, and Joe, in the opposite corner of the elevator, 
              does exactly the same thing.</p>

              authorization... relief...</p>
            <p>There's a PERSISTENT BEEPING, Andrew and Joe pull out their portable 
              telephones at the same time.</p>
            <p>They look at each other: which phone is ringing?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              You.</p>
            <p>Andrew resumes his telephone conversation.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Right.<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Miller.</p>
            <p>The ELEVATOR OPENS: Andrew breezes past the MAN ON<br>
              CRUTCHES, saying to Joe:</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Client of yours?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Funny.</p>
            <p>Andrew hurries down the corridor. Joe waits a moment... then pursues 
              the MAN ON CRUTCHES.</p>
            <p> JOE (CONT.)<br>
              Excuse me..? Sir? Yo!</p>

            <p>THE CAB PULLS UP TO A BROWNSTONE ON A RESIDENTIAL STREET, Andrew 
              hopping out, stuffing papers into his briefcase<br>
              (EXT./DAY) ...</p>
            <p>RUSHING to the door marked &quot;Dr. Roberta Gillman, Internal 
              Medicine.&quot;</p>
            <p>Coming out is a YOUNG ASIAN MAN with a cotton ball taped to the 
              inside of his elbow.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>CLASSICAL MUSIC (INT./DAY) ... AS CAMERA PANS PATIENTS (MOSTLY 
              YOUNG MEN) in a cheerful room... some, like a UPS DELIVERY MAN, 
              are attached to IV's, some sit with arms extended, waiting to be 
              hooked to an IV by TYRONE, a BLACK PHYSICIAN'S AID.</p>
            <p>CAMERA FINDS ANDREW sitting quietly, with an IV drip running into 
              his arm. Andrew is wearing a Walkman, the source of the CLASSICAL 
              MUSIC, and he's reading a legal brief. Most of the people in the 
              room look SICKER than Andrew.</p>
            <p>DIALOGUE CAN BE HEARD under the CLASSICAL MUSIC (although MUSIC 
              dominates the SOUNDTRACK).</p>
            <p> TYRONE<br>
              (slapping a thin PATIENT'S wrist)<br>
              Gonna have to start looking for veins in your feet, sweetheart.</p>
            <p>DR. ROBERTA GILLMAN, passes through, speaking to Andrew:</p>
            <p> DR. GILLMAN<br>
              Andy. Can you stop at my office on your way out?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Sure.</p>
            <p>Andrew is distracted by A HISPANIC MAN across the room, rolling 
              up his sleeve for an IV -- his bare arms, hands, face and neck are 
              marked with PURPLE BLOTCHES.</p>
            <p>Andrew closes his eyes, concentrating for a moment on the CLASSICAL 
              MUSIC... then goes back to work.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>ANDREW HURRIES OUT OF THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE, HAILING A CAB<br>

              (EXT./DAY) ...</p>
            <p>Andrew pushes through glass doors into the plush &quot;Wheeler

            <p>Andrew BLASTS out of the elevator, flashing Anthea a four- star 
              smile. They stride down the corridor together.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Just the dazzling paralegal I wanted to see.</p>
            <p> ANTHEA<br>

              Ninety-eight?! Ninety-eight!</p>
            <p>Andrew reaches the secretaries' station. A cheerful<br>

              Conference call's up. They just started the roll call. Here's the

            <p> HARGREAVE<br>
              Present.</p>
            <p>As the OPERATOR continues the roll call, the SCREEN<br>
              CONTINUES TO SPLIT and HARGREAVE is replaced by a SERIES OF LAWYERS 
              in offices around the country, (MOSTLY WHITE MALES) saying &quot;Present&quot; 
              while in Andrew's section of the screen...</p>
            <p>... Andrew dials a number on another telephone line,</p>

              Present.</p>
            <p>The MULTI-IMAGE SCREEN is now joined by SARAH BECKETT, a suburban, 
              60ish American MOM, in her backyard garden, answering a portable 
              phone.</p>
            <p> SARAH<br>
              Hello?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Hi, Mom. It's me.</p>
            <p>The LAWYERS are into the conference, in their portions of the screen, 
              (their VOICES HEARD underneath Andrew's conversation with his mother).</p>
            <p> SARAH<br>
              Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I'm fine.</p>
            <p> SARAH<br>
              What's Dr. Gillman say?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Hold on, Mom.<br>
              (punching into the conference call)<br>
              There's no way my client will go along with that.</p>
            <p> HARGREAVE<br>
              Who's this?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Andrew Beckett. Hi, Karen. I'm sorry I interrupted...</p>
            <p>He punches out of the conference, back to his Mom (glancing over 
              his shoulder to make sure the door is shut).</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. 
              Just a sec ...<br>
              (conference call)<br>
              Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns.<br>
              (back to Mom)<br>
              My platelets look good too.</p>
            <p> SARAH<br>
              Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me 
              on hold.</p>

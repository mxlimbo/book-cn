            <p>A JUDGE'S CHAMBERS, with couches, soft chairs scattered in a loose 
              circle, like a casual living room.</p>
            <p>Joe and Andrew whisper to each other. The Wyant Wheeler team takes 
              up several chairs. Belinda Conine and Jerome Green sit next to Wheeler 
              and Kenton. Some of their ASSISTANTS stand.</p>
            <p>Wheeler is looking across the room at...</p>
            <p>Andrew, who catches Wheeler's stare.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              You're looking better, Andy. How do you feel?</p>
            <p>SILENCE. Everyone watches Andrew for his reaction.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Fine, thanks, Charles.</p>
            <p>JUDGE LUCAS GARNETT enters his chambers (not wearing a Judge's 
              robe). He shakes hands with Wheeler and Kenton.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              Charles, Walter...</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Congratulations on the new grandson.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              Thank you. We're very happy.</p>
            <p>The Judge brushes by Joe and Andrew without a word. The room becomes 
              SILENT as the Judge takes a seat.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              Attorney for the plaintiff?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              I've seen your television commercials. &quot;If you or anyone you 
              know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, 
              &quot;through the negligence of others.&quot;</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              On behalf of the defendants?</p>
            <p> BELINDA CONINE<br>
              Belinda Conine. Of Petersen, Lehigh, Monroe and Smith.</p>
            <p> JEROME GREEN<br>
              And Jerome Green.</p>
            <p>And a WASPISH lawyer wearing round glasses:</p>
            <p> DEXTER SMITH<br>
              Dexter Smith.</p>
            <p>A white-haired lawyer next to Belinda:</p>
            <p> RALPH PETERSEN<br>
              Ralph Petersen.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              (to Joe)<br>
              You're outnumbered four to one.<br>
              (to the others)<br>
              Whom do I address? I can't talk to four lawyers at<br>
              once.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              I'm chief litigator, Your Honor.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              Fine. I've asked the litigants to be present for this conference, 
              in the hope we can settle this matter today, among ourselves... 
              There is nothing I hate more, than to see lawyers suing each other. 
              If you look at the opinion polls, when Mr. John Q. Citizen is asked 
              to rank professions according to the respect he holds for them... 
              Where are the lawyers? Somewhere below personal fitness trainers 
              and only slightly above child pornographers.<br>
              If we keep suing each other, if we fail to settle the smallest difference 
              among ourselves with<br>
              mutual respect, if we continue to scrap like bucks in heat, we'll 
              fall lower on that list. And when<br>
              people lose respect for lawyers, they lose respect for the law. 
              And when this society loses all respect<br>
              for the law, we'll be murdered in our beds, my friends, our cherished 
              institutions will be burned to the ground and our children and our 
              grandchildren will live like savages.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              If it please Your Honor, we hope to settle this matter.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              By God you will settle it! If you force this case to trial, young 
              man, you'll regret it for the rest of<br>
              your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to 
              settle this matter today?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment 
              and...</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              Hold it, Joe.<br>
              (to Wheeler)<br>
              He wants to come back to work,<br>
              Chuck.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              That's impossible, Your Honor.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              That's impossible, Joe.</p>
            <p> BELINDA CONINE<br>
              If it please Your Honor, we're prepared to offer a cash settlement 
              of twenty-five thousand dollars.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Your generosity overwhelms me, Belinda, considering my client was 
              earning over a hundred thou when he was terminated almost six months 
              ago.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              Give me a break, Joe. Let's cut through these false attitudes. Give 
              them a figure. How much do<br>
              you want?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I want to go back to work, Your Honor.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              You're here at my indulgence, young man. I'm waiting for a figure, 
              Joe.</p>
            <p>Andrew and Joe confer with each other.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, 
              including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost 
              of medical<br>
              care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We 
              would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five 
              hundred thousand dollars.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one 
              million, five. I...</p>
            <p>Andrew WHISPERS to Joe, who interrupts the Judge:</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              One more thing, Your Honor...</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (jumping in)<br>
              Any settlement agreement must include, and this is critical, a letter 
              of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with 
              the quality of my work.</p>
            <p>Charles Wheeler WHISPERS to Belinda Conine.</p>
            <p> BELINDA CONINE<br>
              Your Honor, Mr. Beckett's incompetence nearly sabotaged a 350 million 
              dollar suit.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I was the one who was sabotaged.</p>
            <p> BELINDA CONINE<br>
              We have complaints about Mr. Beckett's lack of preparation, his 
              disorganization, his arrogant, defensive attitude... The list goes 
              on.</p>
            <p> JEROME GREEN<br>
              We have letters.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Why haven't you produced these letters?</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              Take it easy.<br>
              (to Wheeler)<br>
              What's the big deal, Chuck? The boy wants a letter, to show to his 
              mother, for her to keep after<br>
              he's gone. Why are you being hard- assed about this?</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              I wish I could exonerate you, Andy. But I'd have to lie to do it.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (very calm)<br>
              You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under 
              oath, in front of a judge and<br>
              a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.<br>
              (rises)<br>
              Gentlemen.<br>
              (to Belinda)<br>
              Counselor.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Don't do this, Andy.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Whoa, whoa...<br>
              (to Andrew)<br>
              What do you expect them to say,<br>
              you're Alan Dershowitz?</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              A trial takes time, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I think I catch your subtle drift, Walter.</p>
            <p>Andrew saunters out.</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              You'll be sorry, Beckett.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Andy, you don't want this.</p>
            <p>Joe scans the room, all eyes are on him. His frown turns into a 
              grin. He faces the Judge.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              With all due respect, Your Honor, my client chooses to pursue his 
              constitutionally guaranteed right to a trial.</p>
            <p>Joe exits.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>HAND HELD CAMERA SHOT OF: THE FRONT YARD OF A TWO-STORY Colonial 
              house in Downington, Pennsylvania (EXT./DAY) ...</p>
            <p>Andrew walks toward the house, TALKING DIRECTLY TO CAMERA.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              This is the house where I grew up. In Downington, Pennsylvania. 
              (pointing to the ground)<br>
              See this... ?</p>
            <p>The CAMERA POINTS to SEVERAL PAIRS OF CHILD'S HAND PRINTS in the 
              sidewalk, then, BACK TO ANDREW IN CLOSE UP, SMILING.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              Those are my cute little hand prints. And my brother's and my sister's.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL'S VOICE<br>
              (BEHIND CAMERA)<br>
              And today is... ?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Today is my parents' fortieth wedding anniversary.</p>
            <p>Andrew goes inside, speaking to the CAMERA:</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              This is the front door. I caught a finger in this door, once...<br>
              (holds it up)<br>
              This one. Broke it.<br>
              (stepping inside)<br>
              This is the hallway, my mother calls it a foyer...</p>
            <p>INSIDE THE HOUSE (INT./DAY):</p>
            <p>CHILDREN are running through the house, while WOMEN sporting corsages 
              confer in the kitchen. A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL jumps into Andrew's arms.</p>
            <p> ALEXIS<br>
              Uncle Andrew!</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>

              You heard it here first, folks.<br>
              News as it happens.</p>
            <p>Andrew's older and very down to earth sister JILL, puts her arms 
              around Andrew, squeezing tight.</p>
            <p> JILL<br>
              Hello, darlin'.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              This is my sister, Jill, the most fertile woman on the planet. She's 
              married to Reverend Jim.</p>
            <p> JILL<br>
              You feel thin.<br>
              (over Andrew's shoulder)<br>
              Hello, Miguel.</p>
            <p>As Jill leaves Andrew's arms, the CAMERA IS TRADED OFF TO ANDREW, 
              who SHOOTS JILL GIVING MIGUEL A HUG.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              Hey, Jill. Nice to see you, sweetheart.</p>

              Do we?</p>
            <p>CAMERA MOVES DOWN THE CORRIDOR...</p>
            <p> ANDREW (OS)<br>
              And what will we find in... da duh da duh da duh... the KITCHEN!</p>
            <p>A GROUP OF LADIES SCREAM when CAMERA ENTERS KITCHEN.</p>
            <p> LADIES<br>
              There he is! Hi, Andrew! Don't point that thing at me! etc...</p>
            <p>Andrew's mother Sarah wears an unpretentious flowery dress.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?</p>
            <p> SARAH<br>
              Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me 
              a hug.<br>
              (he keeps it pointed at her)<br>
              Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.</p>

              Where's Dad?</p>
            <p> SARAH<br>
              He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.</p>

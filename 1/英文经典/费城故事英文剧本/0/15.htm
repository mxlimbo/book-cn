          <td> CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM CHARLES WHEELER -- ON THE STAND... 
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Why did you recruit Andrew Beckett<br>
              to your firm?</p>
            <p>Andrew uses all his strength to concentrate.</p>
            <p>Charles Wheeler speaks with great sincerity.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              If you're the owner of a major league ball club, you recruit the 
              hot rookie. And Andy was tremendously<br>
              promising as a young attorney. That's why we went after him, that's 
              why we hired him, and that's why we stuck with him, year after year... 
              waiting for<br>
              the promise to be fulfilled. But it never was.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              You kept giving him another chance?</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Of course we did. When you've groomed someone they way we groomed 
              Andy, nurturing him, lavishing all<br>
              kinds of special treatment on him... you've made quite an investment. 
              We were waiting for his promise to kick in, and deliver. But, ultimately, 
              we could no longer ignore the gap between the promise<br>
              and the reality... This is one of the saddest times in my life. 
              To sit in this court, testifying to<br>
              Andy's ultimate failure to make the grade. To discover that he is 
              one of those people who wants to<br>
              benefit by the system, but doesn't want to play by the system's 
              rules. To think you know someone,<br>
              only to find out... you don't know them at all. It's heartbreaking.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Thank you. That's all for now, Your Honor.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              Mr. Miller?</p>
            <p>Joe rises. Adjusts his jacket. Wheeler waits.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              (very gentle)<br>
              Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like 
              I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what 
              you're saying? Not about your understandable, if unfounded, fear<br>
              of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? 
              You're saying, this trial is about<br>
              Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability 
              to do a great job.</p>
            <p>Andrew looks away -- face shiny with sweat, breathing difficult. 
              He takes in the rest of the court, while Wheeler's words THROB THROUGH 
              THE AIR...</p>
            <p> WHEELER (CONT.)<br>
              Andy worked when he wanted to work, telling us what he thought we 
              needed to know about his lifestyle...</p>
            <p>ANDREW'S POV -- ON RACHEL, sitting among the spectators. Rachel 
              begins speaking, her WORDS OVERLAPPING Wheeler's (we should get 
              the feeling she's giving her testimony).</p>
            <p> RACHEL<br>
              I didn't mind covering for Andy, but I did wonder... when was he 
              planning to deal with his problem?</p>
            <p>Andrew blinks... what's going on?</p>
            <p>Looking back to the court: Joe presses in on Wheeler.</p>
            <p>Everything seems normal.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Sometimes it seems like society is run by these kinds of people.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What kind of people?</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              People who want to bend the rules...</p>
            <p>ANDREW'S POV -- KENNETH KILLCOYNE at the defense table:</p>
            <p> KILLCOYNE<br>
              If you want to be a leader in this society, you have to make certain 
              sacrifices.</p>
            <p>Wheeler keeps speaking:</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              ... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live 
              with it.</p>
            <p>ANDREW'S POV -- WALTER KENTON:</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Who makes the rules, Mr. Wheeler? You?</p>
            <p>ANDREW'S POV -- BOB SEIDMAN:</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              Yes, I did see the lesions. I suspected he was sick...</p>
            <p>CLOSE ON ANDREW: closing his eyes.</p>
            <p>THE VOICES GET LOUDER, FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER:</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              The everyday, common person with decent values...</p>
            <p> RACHEL<br>
              It seems like he wasn't willing to face the reality of his situation...</p>
            <p>Andrew slowly rises, the VOICES GETTING LOUDER:</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              ... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              ... But we shouldn't have fired him...</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              ... It's time to get this society back on track!</p>
            <p>Andrew OPENS HIS EYES... WE SWITCH TO HIS POV:</p>
            <p>The Judge, the Jury -- everyone silent, looking concerned.</p>
            <p>ANDREW'S POV of the courtroom floor.</p>
            <p>Andrew falls into his own POV SHOT. In slow motion.</p>
            <p>He lies on the floor, looking up.</p>
            <p>ANDREW'S POV -- Joe steps over him.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Could you call an ambulance, please?</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>A CRISIS IN A HOSPITAL ROOM (INT./DAY) ... MEDICAL STAFF working 
              frenetically, trying to intubate Andrew, who IS HAVING SERIOUS TROUBLE 
              BREATHING, his body HEAVING. The tube they're trying to put in place 
              seems to be making matters worse.</p>
            <p>Miguel stands to the side, furious:</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              It's making it worse. Take it out. Take it out!</p>
            <p>Dr. Gillman RUSHES into the room, in street clothes,<br>
              obviously having answered an emergency call. She tries assessing 
              the situation, just as the tube is removed and Andrew GASPS for 
              breath. A NURSE places an oxygen mask over Andrew's face and he 
              drinks in the air. His eyes are wide open with fear, sweat covering 
              his face.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>

            <p> LESBIAN JUROR (VO)<br>
              If he was &quot;mediocre,&quot; why did they gave him this major 
              assignment three weeks before they fired him?</p>
            <p> POSTAL WORKER JUROR (VO)<br>
              They were testing him.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>JURORS SITTING AROUND A LONG TABLE IN A ROOM WITH TALL, grimy windows 
              (INT./DAY) ...</p>

            <p> WAITRESS JUROR<br>
              They wanted to see if he'd rise to the challenge.</p>
            <p>An American flag hangs on the wall.</p>
            <p> SCHOOLTEACHER JUROR<br>
              They wanted to give him a final chance.</p>
            <p> POSTAL WORKER JUROR<br>
              Makes sense.</p>
            <p> BUSINESSMAN JUROR<br>
              I'd still love to know what happened to that missing file.</p>
            <p> HOMEMAKER JUROR<br>
              Wouldn't we all?</p>

            <p> COLLEGE STUDENT JUROR<br>
              They say he wasn't competent. But, you heard him on the stand.</p>
            <p> ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR<br>
              He sounded pretty smart to me.</p>
            <p> BUSINESSMAN JUROR<br>
              Why would they fire him? Why not a medical leave, or...</p>
            <p> COLLEGE STUDENT JUROR<br>
              They freaked out over the AIDS.</p>
            <p> SCHOOLTEACHER JUROR<br>
              They hate homosexuals.</p>
            <p> BUSINESSMAN JUROR<br>
              It's not against the law to disapprove of homosexuals.</p>
            <p> LESBIAN JUROR<br>
              It is against the law to fire someone for having AIDS. That's why 
              we're here.</p>
            <p> BUSINESSMAN JUROR<br>
              You're the foreman. You haven't said anything. What do you think?</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON -- THE MARINE, sitting at the head of the table.</p>
            <p>CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY ON HIM:</p>
            <p> MARINE JUROR<br>
              They're saying he wasn't a good lawyer. He was mediocre. And the 
              fact that they gave him the most<br>
              important lawsuit they'd ever had, for one of their most important 
              clients... they say that doesn't<br>
              prove anything, because that was just a test. What did they call 
              it? A carrot. To see if he'd rise<br>
              to the occasion... Okay... Say I've got to send a pilot into enemy 
              territory, and he's gonna<br>
              be flying a plane that cost 350 million dollars...<br>
              Who am I going to put into that plane? A rookie who can't cut the 
              grade, because I want to see if<br>
              he'll rise to the challenge? Or am I going to give that assignment 
              to my best pilot, my most experienced, my sharpest, my top gun... 
              The very<br>
              best I've got?</p>
            <p>CLOSE ON THE MARINE:</p>
            <p> MARINE JUROR (CONT.)<br>
              Could somebody please explain that to me... like I'm a six year 
              old?</p>
            <p>HOLD ON THE MARINE, AS THE JUDGE'S VOICE FADES IN:</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT (VO)<br>
              Members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?</p>
            <p> AND CUT TO:</p>
            <p>THE COURTROOM -- NO ONE STIRRING (INT./DAY).</p>
            <p>Joe is utterly cool. Sitting beside Andrew's empty chair.</p>
            <p>Among the spectators, Andrew's siblings, Jill, Matt, Randy, and 
              his parents, Bud and Sarah... Rachel, Anthea and Miguel's sister 
              Maria.</p>
            <p>The Marine rises to his feet.</p>
            <p> MARINE<br>
              We have, Your Honor...</p>
            <p>Charles Wheeler looks the Marine in the eye.</p>
            <p> MARINE (CONT.)<br>
              We find for the plaintiff,<br>
              Andrew Beckett.</p>
            <p>Joe smiles, just barely, remaining calm.</p>
            <p>Charles Wheeler whispers to Belinda Conine.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              Have you awarded any damages?</p>
            <p> MARINE<br>
              Yes, we have, Your Honor.<br>
              (referring to a list)<br>
              For back pay and loss of benefits ... one hundred fortythree thousand 
              dollars.</p>
            <p>Joe shakes his head, disappointed, writing down the amount.</p>
            <p>Wheeler and his crew SMILE -- THIS IS THEIR VICTORY.</p>
            <p> MARINE JUROR (CONT.)<br>
              For damages related to mental anguish and humiliation... we give 
              no award.</p>
            <p>Joe is extremely disappointed.</p>
            <p> MARINE JUROR (CONT.)<br>
              And punitive damages we award... Four million, eight hundred and 
              eighty two thousand dollars.</p>
            <p>Joe throws his pen over his shoulder.</p>
            <p>COURTROOM BURSTS INTO AN UPROAR.</p>
            <p>Andrew's supporters, Joe's colleagues from his office rush forward, 
              pounding him on the back. Andrew's family members hug each other...</p>
            <p>CAMERA CRANES AWAY FROM THIS GROUP, RISING TOWARD THE CEILING AS 
              THE SOUNDS OF THE CROWD FADE...</p>
            <p>OPERA MUSIC FADES IN, TAKING US TO...</p>
            <p>ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING... JOE STEPPING INTO THE CORRIDOR OF a hospital 
              (INT./NIGHT), carrying two shopping bags from the Famous 4th Street 
              deli...</p>
            <p>Joe moves down the corridor, looking for a particular room.</p>
            <p>Dr. Gillman stands outside a hospital room, talking in a low voice 
              to Bud and Sarah Beckett. As Joe passes them, entering Andrew's 
              room, he hears:</p>
            <p> DR. GILLMAN<br>
              ... if he comes out of the hospital this time, you mustn't expect 
              him to be like he was<br>
              before...</p>
            <p>Joe steps into...</p>
            <p>ANDREW'S HOSPITAL ROOM (INT./NIGHT) ...</p>
            <p>A hand-painted banner is strung over Andrew's bed:<br>
              &quot;Victory.&quot;</p>
            <p>OPERA MUSIC plays on a portable CD player. ANDREW lies in a hospital 
              bed, with a pressurized oxygen mask on his face.</p>
            <p>JILL sits on the edge of Andrew's bed, holding his hand, smiling, 
              speaking to Andrew in low tones. With his free hand, Andrew gently 
              strokes Jill's forearm. (Andrew has an amazing assortment of tubes 
              and IVs running into various parts of his body.)</p>
            <p>Andrew's brothers MATT and RANDY are sipping beers with REV. JIM, 
              MIGUEL, Miguel's sister MARIA, Bruno and Chandra, while Matt does 
              a dramatic re-creation of the Marine Juror rendering the judgment. 
              Matt's audience is loving it.</p>
            <p>As Joe comes into the room, Jill rises to take the shopping bags 
              from him. Joe exchanges nods and greetings with the others.</p>
            <p>People KEEP THEIR VOICES LOW, but there's a certain energy, and 
              happiness evident in the room.</p>
            <p>ON ANDREW: Watching his friends and relatives with sparkling eyes 
              and a weak, but grateful and peaceful smile.</p>
            <p>ON JOE: Glancing across the room, catching Andrew's look.</p>
            <p>Andrew smiles at Joe and pats his hospital bed, indicating he wants 
              Joe to sit there.</p>
            <p>Joe crosses the room, sits on the edge of the bed.</p>
            <p>With some difficulty, Andrew removes his oxygen mask. His voice 
              is raspy, weak:</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom 
              of the ocean?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              A good start.</p>
            <p>Joe smiles.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.<br>
              (sees the oxygen mask)<br>
              Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?</p>
            <p>Andrew begins fitting the mask back in place, but his hands are 
              weak. Joe helps adjust the straps behind Andrew's ears.</p>
            <p> JOE (CONT.)<br>
              I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (muffled by the mask)<br>
              Sure thing.</p>
            <p>Joe stands.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I'll see you, Beckett.</p>
            <p>Andrew nods, weakly. But he's still smiling and his eyes are dancing.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (through mask)<br>
              Thanks for coming by.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You bet. We'll see you later.</p>
            <p>Joe heads for the door, meeting Miguel there.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              (to Miguel)<br>
              He's looking good. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets out of here 
              soon.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              We just want to get him home. Thanks for stopping by, Joe.</p>
            <p>Miguel puts his arms around Joe and hugs him. Joe slaps Miguel's 
              back.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Night.</p>
            <p>Joe leaves.</p>
            <p>Miguel begins circulating among the &quot;guests,&quot; saying:</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              He's tired. He ought to sleep.</p>
            <p> CONTINUOUS CUT TO:</p>
            <p>JOE STEPPING INTO THE HOSPITAL ELEVATOR (INT./NIGHT), AND saying 
              to a GROUP OF DOCTORS and NURSES:</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom 
              of the ocean?</p>
            <p>The elevator doors close.</p>
            <p> CONTINUOUS CUT TO:</p>
            <p>ANDREW'S HOSPITAL ROOM...</p>
            <p>Matt gives Andrew's hand a squeeze, before leaving.</p>
            <p> MATT<br>
              Night, Andy. See you tomorrow, buddy.</p>
            <p>Rev. Jim pats Andrew's shoulder.</p>
            <p> REV. JIM<br>
              God bless you, Andy.</p>
            <p>Bud Beckett kisses Andrew on the cheek.</p>
            <p> BUD<br>
              Goodnight, son.<br>
              Get some rest, okay?</p>
            <p>Sarah Beckett is strong, kissing Andrew on the forehead.</p>
            <p> SARAH<br>
              Goodnight angel, my sweet boy...</p>
            <p>Randy Beckett loses control of his emotions as he bends to hug 
              his brother. He begins to sob.</p>
            <p> RANDY<br>
              Andy.</p>
            <p>Andrew puts his weak arms, with the IV lines connected, around 
              his brother Randy, to comfort him.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (through mask)<br>
              I'm okay, bro. I'll see you tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Jill hugs Andrew, giving Miguel a kiss as she leaves the room. 
              Maria waves goodnight from the doorway, closing the door.</p>
            <p>Miguel sits on the edge of the bed, kicking off his shoes.</p>
            <p>Miguel stretches onto the bed next to Andrew, picks up the remote 
              control, and TURNS ON THE TV.</p>
            <p>Andrew pulls aside the oxygen mask, to say:</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I'm ready...</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              Ready for what, baby?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Whatever.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              I hope you're ready for &quot;Studs,&quot; because that's what's 
              on.</p>
            <p>Andrew replaces the oxygen mask.</p>
            <p>They lie next to each other, watching television.</p>
            <p> FADE OUT/FADE IN:</p>
            <p>EXTERIOR: JOE'S HOUSE AT NIGHT, ESTABLISHING...</p>
            <p>From inside the house: the phone rings.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>JOE AND LISA'S DARK BEDROOM, QUIET (INT./NIGHT) ...</p>
            <p>Lisa is sitting up in bed, having answered the phone.</p>
            <p>Joe is just waking up.</p>
            <p> LISA<br>
              (to Joe)<br>
              It's Miguel.</p>
            <p>Joe sits bolt upright.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Miguel?</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>EXTERIOR: ANDREW AND MIGUEL'S LOFT BUILDING, DAY.</p>
            <p>A TAXI ARRIVES and an elegant, well-dressed older COUPLE step out.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>RACHEL OPENS THE DOOR OF THE LOFT, FINDING MIGUEL'S FAMILY on the 
              other side: very dignified, handsome people who have just arrived 
              from Spain. They enter the apartment, where...</p>
            <p>A wake is in progress. Lots of food. People sharing stories about 
              Andrew. Some people laughing. one or two softly crying as they hug 
              each other.</p>
            <p>Someone has set up a &quot;memento&quot; table, with pictures of 
              Andrew at various stages of his life, and things that meant something 
              to him, like programs from the opera, a ballcap, photos of his favorite 
              cat, etc.</p>
            <p>THEME MUSIC PLAYS, but we hear BITS OF DIALOGUE under the music 
              (&quot;You're Miguel's parents?&quot; &quot;Do you remember when 
              Andy...&quot; &quot;I went to college with Andy...&quot; etc.)</p>
            <p>Bud Beckett sits alone, very quiet.</p>
            <p>Miguel leads his parents over to Bud. Bud looks up, rises, extending 
              his hand to MIGUEL'S DAD. Miguel's father shakes his head in sadness, 
              reaches for Bud and pulls him into his arms for an embrace.</p>
            <p>CAMERA MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD, SEEMING TO SEARCH FOR SOMETHING...</p>
            <p>CAMERA ZEROS IN ON THE TV SET, across the room, where BLACK AND 
              WHITE IMAGES ARE FLICKERING, ignored by everyone...</p>
            <p>AS CAMERA GETS CLOSER TO THE TV, it becomes apparent that the images 
              are BLACK AND WHITE HOME MOVIES, converted to video...</p>

            <p>AS CAMERA TRACKS INTO THE TV, PARTY SOUNDS AND THEME MUSIC FADES... 
              People are still talking, still laughing, still crying, but we CAN'T 
              HEAR THEM ANY LONGER. Instead...</p>
            <p>We hear only the SOUNDTRACK from the HOME MOVIES...</p>

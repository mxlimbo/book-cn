              Explain this to me like I'm a six year old, okay? The entire street 
              is clear except for one small area under construction, with a huge 
              hole that is clearly<br>
              marked and blocked off, and you decide you must cross the street 
              at this spot. You fall into the<br>
              hole and you want to sue the city for negligence? ...</p>
            <p> MRS. FINLEY<br>
              Yeah. Do I have a case?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, 
              Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.<br>
              (as they're leaving)<br>

            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I have AIDS.</p>

              Uh, yeah.</p>
            <p>Andrew hesitates. Joe doesn't sound sure.</p>

              Go ahead.</p>
            <p>Andrew sits, Joe returns to his desk. (Joe finds himself acutely

              What can I do for you?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination 
              suit against Charles<br>
              Wheeler and his partners.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Correct. I'm seeking representation.</p>

              I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. 
              I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was 
              doing so well<br>
              on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.</p>

              First on my leg. Then my forearm, my back. Then... my face. For

              The next morning, I was called to the office for a meeting with

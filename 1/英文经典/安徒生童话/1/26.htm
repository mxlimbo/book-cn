              <p class="h" align="center"> OUR AUNT</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> You ought to have known our aunt; she was charming! That is 
                to<br>
                say, she was not charming at all as the word is usually understood;<br>
                but she was good and kind, amusing in her way, and was just as 
                any one ought to be whom people are to talk about and to laugh 
                at. She might have been put into a play, and wholly and solely 
                on account of the fact that she only lived for the theatre and 
                for what was done<br>
                there. She was an honorable matron; but Agent Fabs, whom she used 
                to call &quot;Flabs,&quot; declared that our aunt was stage-struck.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The theatre is my school,&quot; said she, &quot;the source 
                of my knowledge.<br>
                From thence I have resuscitated Biblical history. Now, 'Moses' 
                and<br>
                'Joseph in Egypt'- there are operas for you! I get my universal<br>
                history from the theatre, my geography, and my knowledge of men. 
                Out of the French pieces I get to know life in Paris- slippery, 
                but<br>
                exceedingly interesting. How I have cried over &quot;La Famille<br>
                Roquebourg'- that the man must drink himself to death, so that 
                she may marry the young fellow! Yes, how many tears I have wept 
                in the fifty years I have subscribed to the theatre!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Our aunt knew every acting play, every bit of scenery, every<br>
                character, every one who appeared or had appeared. She seemed 
                really only to live during the nine months the theatre was open. 
                Summertime without a summer theatre seemed to be only a time that 
                made her old; while, on the other hand, a theatrical evening that 
                lasted till midnight was a lengthening of her life. She did not 
                say, as other<br>
                people do, &quot;Now we shall have spring, the stork is here,&quot; 
                or, </p>
              <p>&quot;They've advertised the first strawberries in the papers.&quot; 
                She, on the<br>
                contrary, used to announce the coming of autumn, with &quot;Have 
                you<br>
                heard they're selling boxes for the theatre? now the performances 
                will<br>
                begin.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>She used to value a lodging entirely according to its proximity 
                to<br>
                the theatre. It was a real sorrow to her when she had to leave 
                the<br>
                little lane behind the playhouse, and move into the great street<br>
                that lay a little farther off, and live there in a house where 
                she had<br>
                no opposite neighbors.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;At home,&quot; said she, &quot;my windows must be my opera-box. 
                One<br>
                cannot sit and look into one's self till one's tired; one must 
                see<br>
                people. But now I live just as if I'd go into the country. If 
                I want<br>
                to see human beings, I must go into my kitchen, and sit down on 
                the<br>
                sink, for there only I have opposite neighbors. No; when I lived 
                in my<br>
                dear little lane, I could look straight down into the ironmonger's<br>
                shop, and had only three hundred paces to the theatre; and now 
                I've<br>
                three thousand paces to go, military measurement.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Our aunt was sometimes ill, but however unwell she might feel, 
                she<br>
                never missed the play. The doctor prescribed one day that she 
                should<br>
                put her feet in a bran bath, and she followed his advice; but 
                she<br>
                drove to the theatre all the same, and sat with her feet in bran<br>
                there. If she had died there, she would have been very glad.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Thorwaldsen died in the theatre, and she called that a happy 
                death.<br>
                She could not imagine but that in heaven there must be a theatre<br>
                too. It had not, indeed, been promised us, but we might very well<br>
                imagine it. The many distinguished actors and actresses who had 
                passed away must surely have a field for their talent.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Our aunt had an electric wire from the theatre to her room. A<br>
                telegram used to be dispatched to her at coffee-time, and it used 
                to<br>
                consist of the words, &quot;Herr Sivertsen is at the machinery;&quot; 
                for it was<br>
                he who gave the signal for drawing the curtain up and down and 
                for<br>
                changing the scenes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>From him she used to receive a short and concise description 
                of<br>
                every piece. His opinion of Shakspeare's &quot;Tempest,&quot; 
                was, &quot;Mad<br>
                nonsense! There's so much to put up, and the first scene begins 
                with<br>
                'Water to the front of the wings.'&quot; That is to say, the water 
                had to<br>
                come forward so far. But when, on the other hand, the same interior<br>
                scene remained through five acts, he used to pronounce it a<br>
                sensible, well-written play, a resting play, which performed itself,<br>
                without putting up scenes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In earlier times, by which name our aunt used to designate<br>
                thirty years ago, she and the before-mentioned Herr Sivertsen 
                had been younger. At that time he had already been connected with 
                the<br>
                machinery, and was, as she said, her benefactor. It used to be 
                the<br>
                custom in those days that in the evening performances in the only<br>
                theatre the town possessed, spectators were admitted to the part<br>
                called the &quot;flies,&quot; over the stage, and every machinist 
                had one or two<br>
                places to give away. Often the flies were quite full of good<br>
                company; it was said that generals' wives and privy councillors' 
                wives<br>
                had been up there. It was quite interesting to look down behind 
                the<br>
                scenes, and to see how the people walked to and fro on the stage<br>
                when the curtain was down.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Our aunt had been there several times, as well when there was 
                a<br>
                tragedy as when there was a ballet; for the pieces in which there 
                were<br>
                the greatest number of characters on the stage were the most<br>
                interesting to see from the flies. One sat pretty much in the 
                dark<br>
                up there, and most people took their supper up with them. Once 
                three<br>
                apples and a great piece of bread and butter and sausage fell 
                down<br>
                right into the dungeon of Ugolino, where that unhappy man was 
                to be<br>
                starved to death; and there was great laughter among the audience. 
              </p>
              <p>The sausage was one of the weightiest reasons why the worthy 
                management refused in future to have any spectators up in the 
                flies.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But I was there seven-and-thirty times,&quot; said our 
                aunt, &quot;and I<br>
                shall always remember Mr. Sivertsen for that.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>On the very last evening when the flies were still open to the<br>
                public, the &quot;Judgment of Solomon&quot; was performed, as 
                our aunt<br>
                remembered very well. She had, through the influence of her<br>
                benefactor, Herr Sivertsen, procured a free admission for the 
                Agent<br>
                Fabs, although he did not deserve it in the least, for he was 
                always<br>
                cutting his jokes about the theatre and teasing our aunt; but 
                she<br>
                had procured him a free admission to the flies, for all that. 
                He<br>
                wanted to look at this player-stuff from the other side.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Those were his own words, and they were just like him,&quot; 
                said<br>
                our aunt.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He looked down from above on the 'Judgment of Solomon,&quot; 
                and fell<br>
                asleep over it. One would have thought that he had come from a<br>
                dinner where many toasts had been given. He went to sleep, and 
                was<br>
                locked in. And there he sat through the dark night in the flies, 
                and<br>
                when he woke, he told a story, but our aunt would not believe 
                it.<br>
                &quot;The 'Judgment of Solomon' was over,&quot; he said, &quot;and 
                all the people<br>
                had gone away, up stairs and down stairs; but now the real play 
                began, the after-piece, which was the best of all,&quot; said 
                the agent. &quot;Then life came into the affair. It was not the 
                'Judgment of Solomon' that was performed; no, a real court of 
                judgment was held upon the<br>
                stage.&quot; And Agent Fabs had the impudence to try and make 
                our aunt<br>
                believe all this. That was the thanks she got for having got him 
                a<br>
                place in the flies.<br>
              </p>
              <p>What did the agent say? Why, it was curious enough to hear, but<br>
                there was malice and satire in it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It looked dark enough up there,&quot; said the agent; &quot;but 
                then the<br>
                magic business began- a great performance, 'The Judgment in the<br>
                Theatre.' The box-keepers were at their posts, and every spectator 
                had to show his ghostly pass-book, that it might be decided if 
                he was to be admitted with hands loose or bound, and with or without 
                a muzzle.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Grand people who came too late, when the performance had begun, 
                and young people, who could not always watch the time, were tied 
                up<br>
                outside, and had list slippers put on their feet, with which they 
                were<br>
                allowed to go in before the beginning of the next act, and they 
                had<br>
                muzzles too. And then the 'Judgment on the Stage' began.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;All malice, and not a bit of truth in it,&quot; said our 
                aunt.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The painter, who wanted to get to Paradise, had to go up a<br>
                staircase which he had himself painted, but which no man could<br>
                mount. That was to expiate his sins against perspective. All the<br>
                plants and buildings, which the property-man had placed, with 
                infinite<br>
                pains, in countries to which they did not belong, the poor fellow<br>
                was obliged to put in their right places before cockcrow, if he 
                wanted<br>
                to get into Paradise. Let Herr Fabs see how he would get in himself;<br>
                but what he said of the performers, tragedians and comedians,<br>
                singers and dancers, that was the most rascally of all. Mr. Fabs,<br>
                indeed!- Flabs! He did not deserve to be admitted at all, and 
                our aunt<br>
                would not soil her lips with what he said. And he said, did Flabs,<br>
                that the whole was written down, and it should be printed when 
                he<br>
                was dead and buried, but not before, for he would not risk having<br>
                his arms and legs broken.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Once our aunt had been in fear and trembling in her temple of<br>
                happiness, the theatre. It was on a winter day, one of those days 
                in<br>
                which one has a couple of hours of daylight, with a gray sky. 
                It was<br>
                terribly cold and snowy, but aunt must go to the theatre. A little<br>
                opera and a great ballet were performed, and a prologue and an<br>
                epilogue into the bargain; and that would last till late at night. 
                Our<br>
                aunt must needs go; so she borrowed a pair of fur boots of her 
                lodger- boots with fur inside and out, and which reached far up 
                her legs.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She got to the theatre, and to her box; the boots were warm, 
                and<br>
                she kept them on. Suddenly there was a cry of &quot;Fire!&quot; 
                Smoke was coming from one of the side scenes, and streamed down 
                from the flies, and there was a terrible panic. The people came 
                rushing out, and our aunt was the last in the box, &quot;on the 
                second tier, left-hand side, for from there the scenery looks 
                best,&quot; she used to say. &quot;The scenes are always arranged 
                that they look best from the King's side.&quot; Aunt wanted to 
                come out, but the people before her, in their fright and<br>
                heedlessness, slammed the door of the box; and there sat our aunt, 
                and couldn't get out, and couldn't get in; that is to say, she 
                couldn't<br>
                get into the next box, for the partition was too high for her. 
                She<br>
                called out, and no one heard her; she looked down into the tier 
                of<br>
                boxes below her, and it was empty, and low, and looked quite near, 
                and aunt in her terror felt quite young and light. She thought 
                of<br>
                jumping down, and had got one leg over the partition, the other<br>
                resting on the bench. There she sat astride, as if on horseback,<br>
                well wrapped up in her flowered cloak with one leg hanging out- 
                a<br>
                leg in a tremendous fur boot. That was a sight to behold; and 
                when<br>
                it was beheld, our aunt was heard too, and was saved from burning, 
                for the theatre was not burned down.<br>
              </p>
              <p>That was the most memorable evening of her life, and she was<br>
                glad that she could not see herself, for she would have died with<br>
                confusion.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Her benefactor in the machinery department, Herr Sivertsen,<br>
                visited her every Sunday, but it was a long time from Sunday to<br>
                Sunday. In the latter time, therefore, she used to have in a little<br>
                child &quot;for the scraps;&quot; that is to say, to eat up the 
                remains of the<br>
                dinner. It was a child employed in the ballet, one that certainly<br>
                wanted feeding. The little one used to appear, sometimes as an 
                elf,<br>
                sometimes as a page; the most difficult part she had to play was 
                the<br>
                lion's hind leg in the &quot;Magic Flute;&quot; but as she grew 
                larger she could<br>
                represent the fore-feet of the lion. She certainly only got half 
                a<br>
                guilder for that, whereas the hind legs were paid for with a whole<br>
                guilder; but then she had to walk bent, and to do without fresh 
                air.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That was all very interesting to hear,&quot; said our aunt.<br>
                She deserved to live as long as the theatre stood, but she could<br>
                not last so long; and she did not die in the theatre, but respectably 
                in her bed. Her last words were, moreover, not without meaning. 
                She asked,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What will the play be to-morrow?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>At her death she left about five hundred dollars. We presume<br>
                this from the interest, which came to twenty dollars. This our 
                aunt<br>
                had destined as a legacy for a worthy old spinster who had no 
                friends; it was to be devoted to a yearly subscription for a place 
                in the<br>
                second tier, on the left side, for the Saturday evening, &quot;for 
                on<br>
                that evening two pieces were always given,&quot; it said in the 
                will; and<br>
                the only condition laid upon the person who enjoyed the legacy 
                was,<br>
                that she should think, every Saturday evening, of our aunt, who 
                was<br>
                lying in her grave.<br>
              </p>
              <p>This was our aunt's religion.</p>

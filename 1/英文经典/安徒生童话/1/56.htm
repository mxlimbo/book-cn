              <p class="h" align="center"> THE GIRL WHO TROD ON THE LOAF</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THERE was once a girl who trod on a loaf to avoid soiling her<br>
                shoes, and the misfortunes that happened to her in consequence 
                are<br>
                well known. Her name was Inge; she was a poor child, but proud 
                and<br>
                presuming, and with a bad and cruel disposition. When quite a 
                little<br>
                child she would delight in catching flies, and tearing off their<br>
                wings, so as to make creeping things of them. When older, she 
                would<br>
                take cockchafers and beetles, and stick pins through them. Then 
                she<br>
                pushed a green leaf, or a little scrap of paper towards their 
                feet,<br>
                and when the poor creatures would seize it and hold it fast, and<br>
                turn over and over in their struggles to get free from the pin, 
                she<br>
                would say, &quot;The cockchafer is reading; see how he turns over 
                the<br>
                leaf.&quot; She grew worse instead of better with years, and,<br>
                unfortunately, she was pretty, which caused her to be excused, 
                when<br>
                she should have been sharply reproved.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Your headstrong will requires severity to conquer it,&quot; 
                her mother<br>
                often said to her. &quot;As a little child you used to trample 
                on my apron,<br>
                but one day I fear you will trample on my heart.&quot; And, alas! 
                this fear<br>
                was realized.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Inge was taken to the house of some rich people, who lived at 
                a<br>
                distance, and who treated her as their own child, and dressed 
                her so<br>
                fine that her pride and arrogance increased.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When she had been there about a year, her patroness said to her,<br>
                &quot;You ought to go, for once, and see your parents, Inge.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So Inge started to go and visit her parents; but she only wanted<br>
                to show herself in her native place, that the people might see 
                how<br>
                fine she was. She reached the entrance of the village, and saw 
                the<br>
                young laboring men and maidens standing together chatting, and 
                her own mother amongst them. Inge's mother was sitting on a stone 
                to rest, with a fagot of sticks lying before her, which she had 
                picked up in the wood. Then Inge turned back; she who was so finely 
                dressed she felt ashamed of her mother, a poorly clad woman, who 
                picked up wood in the forest. She did not turn back out of pity 
                for her mother's<br>
                poverty, but from pride.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Another half-year went by, and her mistress said, &quot;you ought 
                to go<br>
                home again, and visit your parents, Inge, and I will give you 
                a<br>
                large wheaten loaf to take to them, they will be glad to see you, 
                I am<br>
                sure.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So Inge put on her best clothes, and her new shoes, drew her 
                dress<br>
                up around her, and set out, stepping very carefully, that she 
                might be<br>
                clean and neat about the feet, and there was nothing wrong in 
                doing<br>
                so. But when she came to the place where the footpath led across 
                the<br>
                moor, she found small pools of water, and a great deal of mud, 
                so<br>
                she threw the loaf into the mud, and trod upon it, that she might 
                pass<br>
                without wetting her feet. But as she stood with one foot on the 
                loaf<br>
                and the other lifted up to step forward, the loaf began to sink<br>
                under her, lower and lower, till she disappeared altogether, and<br>
                only a few bubbles on the surface of the muddy pool remained to 
                show where she had sunk. And this is the story.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But where did Inge go? She sank into the ground, and went down<br>
                to the Marsh Woman, who is always brewing there.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Marsh Woman is related to the elf maidens, who are well-known,<br>
                for songs are sung and pictures painted about them. But of the 
                Marsh<br>
                Woman nothing is known, excepting that when a mist arises from 
                the<br>
                meadows, in summer time, it is because she is brewing beneath 
                them. </p>
              <p>To the Marsh Woman's brewery Inge sunk down to a place which 
                no one can endure for long. A heap of mud is a palace compared 
                with the Marsh Woman's brewery; and as Inge fell she shuddered 
                in every limb, and soon became cold and stiff as marble. Her foot 
                was still fastened to the loaf, which bowed her down as a golden 
                ear of corn bends the stem.<br>
              </p>
              <p>An evil spirit soon took possession of Inge, and carried her 
                to<br>
                a still worse place, in which she saw crowds of unhappy people,<br>
                waiting in a state of agony for the gates of mercy to be opened 
                to<br>
                them, and in every heart was a miserable and eternal feeling of<br>
                unrest. It would take too much time to describe the various tortures<br>
                these people suffered, but Inge's punishment consisted in standing<br>
                there as a statue, with her foot fastened to the loaf. She could<br>
                move her eyes about, and see all the misery around her, but she<br>
                could not turn her head; and when she saw the people looking at 
                her<br>
                she thought they were admiring her pretty face and fine clothes, 
                for<br>
                she was still vain and proud. But she had forgotten how soiled 
                her<br>
                clothes had become while in the Marsh Woman's brewery, and that 
                they were covered with mud; a snake had also fastened itself in 
                her hair, and hung down her back, while from each fold in her 
                dress a great toad peeped out and croaked like an asthmatic poodle. 
                Worse than all was the terrible hunger that tormented her, and 
                she could not stoop to break off a piece of the loaf on which 
                she stood. No; her back was too stiff, and her whole body like 
                a pillar of stone. And then came creeping over her face and eyes 
                flies without wings; she winked and blinked, but they could not 
                fly away, for their wings had been<br>
                pulled off; this, added to the hunger she felt, was horrible torture.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;If this lasts much longer,&quot; she said, &quot;I shall 
                not be able to<br>
                bear it.&quot; But it did last, and she had to bear it, without 
                being<br>
                able to help herself.<br>
              </p>
              <p>A tear, followed by many scalding tears, fell upon her head, 
                and<br>
                rolled over her face and neck, down to the loaf on which she stood.<br>
                Who could be weeping for Inge? She had a mother in the world still,<br>
                and the tears of sorrow which a mother sheds for her child will 
                always find their way to the child's heart, but they often increase 
                the<br>
                torment instead of being a relief. And Inge could hear all that 
                was<br>
                said about her in the world she had left, and every one seemed 
                cruel<br>
                to her. The sin she had committed in treading on the loaf was 
                known on earth, for she had been seen by the cowherd from the 
                hill, when she was crossing the marsh and had disappeared.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When her mother wept and exclaimed, &quot;Ah, Inge! what grief 
                thou<br>
                hast caused thy mother&quot; she would say, &quot;Oh that I had 
                never been born!<br>
              </p>
              <p>My mother's tears are useless now.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And then the words of the kind people who had adopted her came<br>
                to her ears, when they said, &quot;Inge was a sinful girl, who 
                did not<br>
                value the gifts of God, but trampled them under her feet.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah,&quot; thought Inge, &quot;they should have punished 
                me, and driven<br>
                all my naughty tempers out of me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>A song was made about &quot;The girl who trod on a loaf to keep 
                her<br>
                shoes from being soiled,&quot; and this song was sung everywhere. 
                The story of her sin was also told to the little children, and 
                they called her<br>
                &quot;wicked Inge,&quot; and said she was so naughty that she 
                ought to be<br>
                punished. Inge heard all this, and her heart became hardened and<br>
                full of bitterness.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But one day, while hunger and grief were gnawing in her hollow<br>
                frame, she heard a little, innocent child, while listening to 
                the tale<br>
                of the vain, haughty Inge, burst into tears and exclaim, &quot;But 
                will she<br>
                never come up again?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And she heard the reply, &quot;No, she will never come up again.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But if she were to say she was sorry, and ask pardon, and 
                promise<br>
                never to do so again?&quot; asked the little one.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, then she might come; but she will not beg pardon,&quot; 
                was the<br>
                answer.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, I wish she would!&quot; said the child, who was quite 
                unhappy<br>
                about it. &quot;I should be so glad. I would give up my doll and 
                all my<br>
                playthings, if she could only come here again. Poor Inge! it is 
                so<br>
                dreadful for her.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>These pitying words penetrated to Inge's inmost heart, and<br>
                seemed to do her good. It was the first time any one had said, 
                &quot;Poor<br>
                Inge!&quot; without saying something about her faults. A little 
                innocent<br>
                child was weeping, and praying for mercy for her. It made her 
                feel<br>
                quite strange, and she would gladly have wept herself, and it 
                added to<br>
                her torment to find she could not do so. And while she thus suffered<br>
                in a place where nothing changed, years passed away on earth, 
                and<br>
                she heard her name less frequently mentioned. But one day a sigh<br>
                reached her ear, and the words, &quot;Inge! Inge! what a grief 
                thou hast<br>
                been to me! I said it would be so.&quot; It was the last sigh 
                of her<br>
                dying mother.<br>
              </p>
              <p>After this, Inge heard her kind mistress say, &quot;Ah, poor 
                Inge!<br>
                shall I ever see thee again? Perhaps I may, for we know not what 
                may<br>
                happen in the future.&quot; But Inge knew right well that her 
                mistress<br>
                would never come to that dreadful place.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Time-passed- a long bitter time- then Inge heard her name<br>
                pronounced once more, and saw what seemed two bright stars shining 
                above her. They were two gentle eyes closing on earth. Many years 
                had passed since the little girl had lamented and wept about &quot;poor 
                Inge.&quot; That child was now an old woman, whom God was taking 
                to Himself. In the last hour of existence the events of a whole 
                life often appear before us; and this hour the old woman remembered 
                how, when a child, she had shed tears over the story of Inge, 
                and she<br>
                prayed for her now. As the eyes of the old woman closed to earth,<br>
                the eyes of the soul opened upon the hidden things of eternity, 
                and<br>
                then she, in whose last thoughts Inge had been so vividly present, 
                saw<br>
                how deeply the poor girl had sunk. She burst into tears at the<br>
                sight, and in heaven, as she had done when a little child on earth,<br>
                she wept and prayed for poor Inge. Her tears and her prayers echoed<br>
                through the dark void that surrounded the tormented captive soul,<br>
                and the unexpected mercy was obtained for it through an angel's 
                tears.<br>
              </p>
              <p>As in thought Inge seemed to act over again every sin she had<br>
                committed on earth, she trembled, and tears she had never yet 
                been<br>
                able to weep rushed to her eyes. It seemed impossible that the 
                gates<br>
                of mercy could ever be opened to her; but while she acknowledged<br>
                this in deep penitence, a beam of radiant light shot suddenly 
                into the<br>
                depths upon her. More powerful than the sunbeam that dissolves 
                the man of snow which the children have raised, more quickly than 
                the<br>
                snowflake melts and becomes a drop of water on the warm lips of 
                a<br>
                child, was the stony form of Inge changed, and as a little bird 
                she<br>
                soared, with the speed of lightning, upward to the world of mortals. 
                A<br>
                bird that felt timid and shy to all things around it, that seemed 
                to<br>
                shrink with shame from meeting any living creature, and hurriedly<br>
                sought to conceal itself in a dark corner of an old ruined wall; 
                there<br>
                it sat cowering and unable to utter a sound, for it was voiceless. 
                Yet<br>
                how quickly the little bird discovered the beauty of everything 
                around<br>
                it. The sweet, fresh air; the soft radiance of the moon, as its<br>
                light spread over the earth; the fragrance which exhaled from 
                bush and tree, made it feel happy as it sat there clothed in its 
                fresh,<br>
                bright plumage. All creation seemed to speak of beneficence and<br>
                love. The bird wanted to give utterance to thoughts that stirred 
                in<br>
                his breast, as the cuckoo and the nightingale in the spring, but 
                it<br>
                could not. Yet in heaven can be heard the song of praise, even 
                from<br>
                a worm; and the notes trembling in the breast of the bird were 
                as<br>
                audible to Heaven even as the psalms of David before they had<br>
                fashioned themselves into words and song.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Christmas-time drew near, and a peasant who dwelt close by the 
                old<br>
                wall stuck up a pole with some ears of corn fastened to the top,<br>
                that the birds of heaven might have feast, and rejoice in the 
                happy,<br>
                blessed time. And on Christmas morning the sun arose and shone 
                upon the ears of corn, which were quickly surrounded by a number 
                of twittering birds. Then, from a hole in the wall, gushed forth 
                in<br>
                song the swelling thoughts of the bird as he issued from his hiding<br>
                place to perform his first good deed on earth,- and in heaven 
                it was<br>
                well known who that bird was.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The winter was very hard; the ponds were covered with ice, and<br>
                there was very little food for either the beasts of the field 
                or the<br>
                birds of the air. Our little bird flew away into the public roads, 
                and<br>
                found here and there, in the ruts of the sledges, a grain of corn, 
                and<br>
                at the halting places some crumbs. Of these he ate only a few, 
                but<br>
                he called around him the other birds and the hungry sparrows, 
                that<br>
                they too might have food. He flew into the towns, and looked about,<br>
                and wherever a kind hand had strewed bread on the window-sill 
                for<br>
                the birds, he only ate a single crumb himself, and gave all the 
                rest<br>
                to the rest of the other birds. In the course of the winter the 
                bird<br>
                had in this way collected many crumbs and given them to other 
                birds,<br>
                till they equalled the weight of the loaf on which Inge had trod 
                to<br>
                keep her shoes clean; and when the last bread-crumb had been found 
                and given, the gray wings of the bird became white, and spread<br>
                themselves out for flight.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;See, yonder is a sea-gull!&quot; cried the children, when 
                they saw the<br>
                white bird, as it dived into the sea, and rose again into the 
                clear<br>
                sunlight, white and glittering. But no one could tell whither 
                it<br>
                went then although some declared it flew straight to the sun.</p>

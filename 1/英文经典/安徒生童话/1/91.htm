              <p class="h" align="center"> THE SAUCY BOY</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> ONCE upon a time there was an old poet, one of those right good<br>
                old poets.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One evening, as he was sitting at home, there was a terrible 
                storm<br>
                going on outside; the rain was pouring down, but the old poet 
                sat<br>
                comfortably in his chimney-corner, where the fire was burning 
                and<br>
                the apples were roasting.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There will not be a dry thread left on the poor people 
                who are<br>
                out in this weather,&quot; he said.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, open the door! I am so cold and wet through,&quot; 
                called a little<br>
                child outside. It was crying and knocking at the door, whilst 
                the rain<br>
                was pouring down and the wind was rattling all the windows.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Poor creature!&quot; said the poet, and got up and opened 
                the door.<br>
                Before him stood a little boy; he was naked, and the water flowed 
                from his long fair locks. He was shivering with cold; if he had 
                not been let in, he would certainly have perished in the storm.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Poor little thing!&quot; said the poet, and took him by 
                the hand.<br>
                &quot;Come to me; I will soon warm you. You shall have some wine 
                and n<br>
                apple, for you are such a pretty boy.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And he was, too. His eyes sparkled like two bright stars, and<br>
                although the water flowed down from his fair locks, they still<br>
                curled quite beautifully.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He looked like a little angel, but was pale with cold, and<br>
                trembling all over. In his hand he held a splendid bow, but it 
                had<br>
                been entirely spoilt by the rain, and the colours of the pretty 
                arrows<br>
                had run into one another by getting wet.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The old man sat down by the fire, and taking the little boy on 
                his<br>
                knee, wrung the water out of his locks and warmed his hands in 
                his<br>
                own.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He then made him some hot spiced wine, which quickly revived<br>
                him; so that with reddening cheeks, he sprang upon the floor and<br>
                danced around the old man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are a merry boy,&quot; said the latter. &quot;What 
                is your name?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;My name is Cupid,&quot; he answered. &quot;Don't you know 
                me? There lies my bow. I shoot with that, you know. Look, the 
                weather is getting fine again- the moon is shining.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But your bow is spoilt,&quot; said the old poet.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That would be unfortunate,&quot; said the little boy, taking 
                it up and<br>
                looking at it. &quot;Oh, it's quite dry and isn't damaged at all. 
                The<br>
                string is quite tight; I'll try it.&quot; So, drawing it back, 
                he took an<br>
                arrow, aimed, and shot the good old poet right in the heart. &quot;Do 
                you<br>
                see now that my bow was not spoilt?&quot; he said, and, loudly 
                laughing,<br>
                ran away. What a naughty boy to shoot the old poet like that, 
                who<br>
                had taken him into his warm room, had been so good to him, and 
                had<br>
                given him the nicest wine and the best apple!<br>
              </p>
              <p>The good old man lay upon the floor crying; he was really shot<br>
                in the heart. &quot;Oh!&quot; he cried, &quot;what a naughty boy 
                this Cupid is! I<br>
                shall tell all the good children about this, so that they take 
                care<br>
                never to play with him, lest he hurt them.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And all good children, both girls and boys, whom he told about<br>
                this, were on their guard against wicked Cupid; but he deceives 
                them<br>
                all the same, for he is very deep. When the students come out 
                of<br>
                class, he walks beside them with a book under his arm, and wearing 
                a<br>
                black coat. They cannot recognize him. And then, if they take 
                him by<br>
                the arm, believing him to be a student too, he sticks an arrow 
                into<br>
                their chest. And when the girls go to church to be confirmed, 
                he is<br>
                amongst them too. In fact, he is always after people. He sits 
                in the<br>
                large chandelier in the theatre and blazes away, so that people<br>
                think it is a lamp; but they soon find out their mistake. He walks<br>
                about in the castle garden and on the promenades. Yes, once he 
                shot<br>
                your father and your mother in the heart too. Just ask them, and 
                you<br>
                will hear what they say. Oh! he is a bad boy, this Cupid, and 
                you must never have anything to do with him, for he is after every 
                one. Just think, he even shot an arrow at old grandmother; but 
                that was a long time ago. The wound has long been healed, but 
                such things are never forgotten.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now you know what a bad boy this wicked Cupid is.</p>

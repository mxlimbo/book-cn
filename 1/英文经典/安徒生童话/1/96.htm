              <p class="h" align="center"> THE SNAIL AND THE ROSE-TREE</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> ROUND about the garden ran a hedge of hazel-bushes; beyond the<br>
                hedge were fields and meadows with cows and sheep; but in the 
                middle of the garden stood a Rose-tree in bloom, under which sat 
                a Snail, whose shell contained a great deal- that is, himself.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Only wait till my time comes,&quot; he said; &quot;I shall 
                do more than<br>
                grow roses, bear nuts, or give milk, like the hazel-bush, the 
                cows and<br>
                the sheep.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I expect a great deal from you,&quot; said the rose-tree. 
                &quot;May I ask<br>
                when it will appear?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I take my time,&quot; said the snail. &quot;You're always 
                in such a<br>
                hurry. That does not excite expectation.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The following year the snail lay in almost the same spot, in 
                the<br>
                sunshine under the rose-tree, which was again budding and bearing<br>
                roses as fresh and beautiful as ever. The snail crept half out 
                of<br>
                his shell, stretched out his horns, and drew them in again.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Everything is just as it was last year! No progress at 
                all; the<br>
                rose-tree sticks to its roses and gets no farther.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The summer and the autumn passed; the rose-tree bore roses and<br>
                buds till the snow fell and the weather became raw and wet; then 
                it<br>
                bent down its head, and the snail crept into the ground.<br>
              </p>
              <p>A new year began; the roses made their appearance, and the snail<br>
                made his too.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are an old rose-tree now,&quot; said the snail. &quot;You 
                must make<br>
                haste and die. You have given the world all that you had in you;<br>
                whether it was of much importance is a question that I have not 
                had<br>
                time to think about. But this much is clear and plain, that you 
                have<br>
                not done the least for your inner development, or you would have<br>
                produced something else. Have you anything to say in defence? 
                You will now soon be nothing but a stick. Do you understand what 
                I say?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You frighten me,&quot; said the rose- tree. &quot;I have 
                never thought of<br>
                that.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, you have never taken the trouble to think at all. Have 
                you<br>
                ever given yourself an account why you bloomed, and how your<br>
                blooming comes about- why just in that way and in no other?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No,&quot; said the rose-tree. &quot;I bloom in gladness, 
                because I cannot<br>
                do otherwise. The sun shone and warmed me, and the air refreshed 
                me; I drank the clear dew and the invigorating rain. I breathed 
                and I lived!<br>
              </p>
              <p>Out of the earth there arose a power within me, whilst from above 
                I<br>
                also received strength; I felt an ever-renewed and ever-increasing<br>
                happiness, and therefore I was obliged to go on blooming. That 
                was<br>
                my life; I could not do otherwise.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You have led a very easy life,&quot; remarked the snail.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Certainly. Everything was given me,&quot; said the rose-tree. 
                &quot;But<br>
                still more was given to you. Yours is one of those deep-thinking<br>
                natures, one of those highly gifted minds that astonishes the 
                world.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I have not the slightest intention of doing so,&quot; said 
                the<br>
                snail. &quot;The world is nothing to me. What have I to do with 
                the<br>
                world? I have enough to do with myself, and enough in myself&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But must we not all here on earth give up our best parts 
                to<br>
                others, and offer as much as lies in our power? It is true, I 
                have<br>
                only given roses. But you- you who are so richly endowed- what 
                have<br>
                you given to the world? What will you give it?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What have I given? What am I going to give? I spit at it; 
                it's<br>
                good for nothing, and does not concern me. For my part, you ma 
                go<br>
                on bearing roses; you cannot do anything else. Let the hazel bush 
                bear nuts, and the cows and sheep give milk; they have each their 
                public. I have mine in myself. I retire within myself and there 
                I stop. The world is nothing to me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>With this the snail withdrew into his house and blocked up the<br>
                entrance.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That's very sad,&quot; said the rose tree. &quot;I cannot 
                creep into<br>
                myself, however much I might wish to do so; I have to go on bearing<br>
                roses. Then they drop their leaves, which are blown away by the<br>
                wind. But I once saw how a rose was laid in the mistress's<br>
                hymn-book, and how one of my roses found a place in the bosom 
                of a young beautiful girl, and how another was kissed by the lips 
                of a<br>
                child in the glad joy of life. That did me good; it was a real<br>
                blessing. Those are my recollections, my life.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the rose tree went on blooming in innocence, while the snail<br>
                lay idling in his house- the world was nothing to him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Years passed by.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The snail had turned to earth in the earth, and the rose tree 
                too.<br>
                Even the souvenir rose in the hymn-book was faded, but in the 
                garden<br>
                there were other rose trees and other snails. The latter crept 
                into<br>
                their houses and spat at the world, for it did not concern them.<br>
                Shall we read the story all over again? It will be just the same.</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> THE EMPEROR'S NEW SUIT</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> MANY, many years ago lived an emperor, who thought so much of<br>
                new clothes that he spent all his money in order to obtain them; 
                his<br>
                only ambition was to be always well dressed. He did not care for 
                his<br>
                soldiers, and the theatre did not amuse him; the only thing, in<br>
                fact, he thought anything of was to drive out and show a new suit 
                of<br>
                clothes. He had a coat for every hour of the day; and as one would 
                say of a king &quot;He is in his cabinet,&quot; so one could say 
                of him, &quot;The<br>
                emperor is in his dressing-room.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The great city where he resided was very gay; every day many<br>
                strangers from all parts of the globe arrived. One day two swindlers<br>
                came to this city; they made people believe that they were weavers,<br>
                and declared they could manufacture the finest cloth to be imagined.<br>
                Their colours and patterns, they said, were not only exceptionally<br>
                beautiful, but the clothes made of their material possessed the<br>
                wonderful quality of being invisible to any man who was unfit 
                for<br>
                his office or unpardonably stupid.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That must be wonderful cloth,&quot; thought the emperor. 
                &quot;If I were to<br>
                be dressed in a suit made of this cloth I should be able to find 
                out<br>
                which men in my empire were unfit for their places, and I could<br>
                distinguish the clever from the stupid. I must have this cloth 
                woven<br>
                for me without delay.&quot; And he gave a large sum of money to 
                the<br>
                swindlers, in advance, that they should set to work without any 
                loss<br>
                of time. They set up two looms, and pretended to be very hard 
                at work, but they did nothing whatever on the looms. They asked 
                for the<br>
                finest silk and the most precious gold-cloth; all they got they 
                did<br>
                away with, and worked at the empty looms till late at night.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I should very much like to know how they are getting on 
                with<br>
                the cloth,&quot; thought the emperor. But he felt rather uneasy 
                when he<br>
                remembered that he who was not fit for his office could not see 
                it.<br>
                Personally, he was of opinion that he had nothing to fear, yet 
                he<br>
                thought it advisable to send somebody else first to see how matters<br>
                stood. Everybody in the town knew what a remarkable quality the<br>
                stuff possessed, and all were anxious to see how bad or stupid 
                their<br>
                neighbours were.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I shall send my honest old minister to the weavers,&quot; 
                thought<br>
                the emperor. &quot;He can judge best how the stuff looks, for 
                he is<br>
                intelligent, and nobody understands his office better than he.&quot;<br>
                The good old minister went into the room where the swindlers sat<br>
                before the empty looms. &quot;Heaven preserve us!&quot; he thought, 
                and opened his eyes wide, &quot;I cannot see anything at all,&quot; 
                but he did not say so. Both swindlers requested him to come near, 
                and asked him if he did not admire the exquisite pattern and the 
                beautiful colours, pointing to the empty looms. The poor old minister 
                tried his very best, but he could see nothing, for there was nothing 
                to be seen. &quot;Oh dear,&quot; he thought, &quot;can I be so 
                stupid? I should never have thought so, and nobody must know it! 
                Is it possible that I am not fit for my office?<br>
              </p>
              <p>No, no, I cannot say that I was unable to see the cloth.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now, have you got nothing to say?&quot; said one of the 
                swindlers,<br>
                while he pretended to be busily weaving.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, it is very pretty, exceedingly beautiful,&quot; replied 
                the old<br>
                minister looking through his glasses. &quot;What a beautiful pattern,<br>
                what brilliant colours! I shall tell the emperor that I like the 
                cloth<br>
                very much.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We are pleased to hear that,&quot; said the two weavers, 
                and described<br>
                to him the colours and explained the curious pattern. The old 
                minister<br>
                listened attentively, that he might relate to the emperor what 
                they<br>
                said; and so he did.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now the swindlers asked for more money, silk and gold-cloth, 
                which<br>
                they required for weaving. They kept everything for themselves, 
                and<br>
                not a thread came near the loom, but they continued, as hitherto, 
                to<br>
                work at the empty looms.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Soon afterwards the emperor sent another honest courtier to the<br>
                weavers to see how they were getting on, and if the cloth was 
                nearly<br>
                finished. Like the old minister, he looked and looked but could 
                see<br>
                nothing, as there was nothing to be seen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Is it not a beautiful piece of cloth?&quot; asked the two 
                swindlers,<br>
                showing and explaining the magnificent pattern, which, however, 
                did<br>
                not exist.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I am not stupid,&quot; said the man. &quot;It is therefore 
                my good<br>
                appointment for which I am not fit. It is very strange, but I 
                must not<br>
                let any one know it;&quot; and he praised the cloth, which he 
                did not<br>
                see, and expressed his joy at the beautiful colours and the fine<br>
                pattern. &quot;It is very excellent,&quot; he said to the emperor.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Everybody in the whole town talked about the precious cloth. 
                At<br>
                last the emperor wished to see it himself, while it was still 
                on the<br>
                loom. With a number of courtiers, including the two who had already<br>
                been there, he went to the two clever swindlers, who now worked 
                as<br>
                hard as they could, but without using any thread.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Is it not magnificent?&quot; said the two old statesmen 
                who had been<br>
                there before. &quot;Your Majesty must admire the colours and the<br>
                pattern.&quot; And then they pointed to the empty looms, for they<br>
                imagined the others could see the cloth.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What is this?&quot; thought the emperor, &quot;I do not 
                see anything at<br>
                all. That is terrible! Am I stupid? Am I unfit to be emperor? 
                That<br>
                would indeed be the most dreadful thing that could happen to me.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Really,&quot; he said, turning to the weavers, &quot;your 
                cloth has our<br>
                most gracious approval;&quot; and nodding contentedly he looked 
                at the<br>
                empty loom, for he did not like to say that he saw nothing. All 
                his<br>
                attendants, who were with him, looked and looked, and although 
                they<br>
                could not see anything more than the others, they said, like the<br>
                emperor, &quot;It is very beautiful.&quot; And all advised him 
                to wear the new<br>
                magnificent clothes at a great procession which was soon to take<br>
                place. &quot;It is magnificent, beautiful, excellent,&quot; one 
                heard them<br>
                say; everybody seemed to be delighted, and the emperor appointed 
                the two swindlers &quot;Imperial Court weavers.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The whole night previous to the day on which the procession was 
                to<br>
                take place, the swindlers pretended to work, and burned more than<br>
                sixteen candles. People should see that they were busy to finish 
                the<br>
                emperor's new suit. They pretended to take the cloth from the 
                loom,<br>
                and worked about in the air with big scissors, and sewed with<br>
                needles without thread, and said at last: &quot;The emperor's 
                new suit is<br>
                ready now.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The emperor and all his barons then came to the hall; the<br>
                swindlers held their arms up as if they held something in their<br>
                hands and said: &quot;These are the trousers!&quot; &quot;This 
                is the coat!&quot; and<br>
                &quot;Here is the cloak!&quot; and so on. &quot;They are all as 
                light as a cobweb,<br>
                and one must feel as if one had nothing at all upon the body; 
                but that<br>
                is just the beauty of them.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Indeed!&quot; said all the courtiers; but they could not 
                see anything,<br>
                for there was nothing to be seen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Does it please your Majesty now to graciously undress,&quot; 
                said<br>
                the swindlers, &quot;that we may assist your Majesty in putting 
                on the<br>
                new suit before the large looking-glass?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The emperor undressed, and the swindlers pretended to put the<br>
                new suit upon him, one piece after another; and the emperor looked<br>
                at himself in the glass from every side.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How well they look! How well they fit!&quot; said all. 
                &quot;What a<br>
                beautiful pattern! What fine colours! That is a magnificent suit 
                of<br>
                clothes!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The master of the ceremonies announced that the bearers of the<br>
                canopy, which was to be carried in the procession, were ready.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I am ready,&quot; said the emperor. &quot;Does not my suit 
                fit me<br>
                marvellously?&quot; Then he turned once more to the looking-glass, 
                that<br>
                people should think he admired his garments.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The chamberlains, who were to carry the train, stretched their<br>
                hands to the ground as if they lifted up a train, and pretended 
                to<br>
                hold something in their hands; they did not like people to know 
                that<br>
                they could not see anything.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The emperor marched in the procession under the beautiful<br>
                canopy, and all who saw him in the street and out of the windows<br>
                exclaimed: &quot;Indeed, the emperor's new suit is incomparable! 
                What a<br>
                long train he has! How well it fits him!&quot; Nobody wished to 
                let<br>
                others know he saw nothing, for then he would have been unfit 
                for<br>
                his office or too stupid. Never emperor's clothes were more admired.<br>
                &quot;But he has nothing on at all,&quot; said a little child 
                at last. &quot;Good<br>
                heavens! listen to the voice of an innocent child,&quot; said 
                the father,<br>
                and one whispered to the other what the child had said. &quot;But 
                he has<br>
                nothing on at all,&quot; cried at last the whole people. That 
                made a deep<br>
                impression upon the emperor, for it seemed to him that they were<br>
                right; but he thought to himself, &quot;Now I must bear up to 
                the end.&quot; And the chamberlains walked with still greater 
                dignity, as if they carried the train which did not exist.</p>

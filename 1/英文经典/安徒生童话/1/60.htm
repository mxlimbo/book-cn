              <p class="h" align="center"> THE HAPPY FAMILY</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THE largest green leaf in this country is certainly the burdock-leaf. 
                If you hold it in front of you, it is large enough for an apron; 
                and if you hold it over your head, it is almost as good as an 
                umbrella, it is so wonderfully large. A burdock never grows alone; 
                where it grows, there are many more, and it is a splendid sight; 
                and all this splendor is good for snails. The great white snails, 
                which grand people in olden times used to have made into fricassees; 
                and when they had eaten them, they would say, &quot;O, what a 
                delicious dish!&quot; for these people really thought them good; 
                and these snails lived on burdock-leaves, and for them the burdock 
                was planted.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There was once an old estate where no one now lived to require<br>
                snails; indeed, the owners had all died out, but the burdock still<br>
                flourished; it grew over all the beds and walks of the garden- 
                its<br>
                growth had no check- till it became at last quite a forest of<br>
                burdocks. Here and there stood an apple or a plum-tree; but for<br>
                this, nobody would have thought the place had ever been a garden. 
                It<br>
                was burdock from one end to the other; and here lived the last 
                two<br>
                surviving snails. They knew not themselves how old they were; 
                but they could remember the time when there were a great many 
                more of them, and that they were descended from a family which 
                came from foreign lands, and that the whole forest had been planted 
                for them and theirs.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They had never been away from the garden; but they knew that 
                another place once existed in the world, called the Duke's Palace 
                Castle, in which some of their relations had been boiled till 
                they became black, and were then laid on a silver dish; but what 
                was done<br>
                afterwards they did not know. Besides, they could not imagine<br>
                exactly how it felt to be boiled and placed on a silver dish; 
                but no<br>
                doubt it was something very fine and highly genteel. Neither the<br>
                cockchafer, nor the toad, nor the earth-worm, whom they questioned<br>
                about it, would give them the least information; for none of their<br>
                relations had ever been cooked or served on a silver dish. The 
                old<br>
                white snails were the most aristocratic race in the world,- they<br>
                knew that. The forest had been planted for them, and the nobleman's<br>
                castle had been built entirely that they might be cooked and laid 
                on<br>
                silver dishes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They lived quite retired and very happily; and as they had no<br>
                children of their own, they had adopted a little common snail, 
                which<br>
                they brought up as their own child. The little one would not grow, 
                for<br>
                he was only a common snail; but the old people, particularly the<br>
                mother-snail, declared that she could easily see how he grew; 
                and when the father said he could not perceive it, she begged 
                him to feel the little snail's shell, and he did so, and found 
                that the mother was<br>
                right.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One day it rained very fast. &quot;Listen, what a drumming there 
                is<br>
                on the burdock-leaves; turn, turn, turn; turn, turn, turn,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                father-snail.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There come the drops,&quot; said the mother; &quot;they 
                are trickling<br>
                down the stalks. We shall have it very wet here presently. I am 
                very<br>
                glad we have such good houses, and that the little one has one 
                of<br>
                his own. There has been really more done for us than for any other<br>
                creature; it is quite plain that we are the most noble people 
                in the<br>
                world. We have houses from our birth, and the burdock forest has<br>
                been planted for us. I should very much like to know how far it<br>
                extends, and what lies beyond it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There can be nothing better than we have here,&quot; said 
                the<br>
                father-snail; &quot;I wish for nothing more.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, but I do,&quot; said the mother; &quot;I should like 
                to be taken to<br>
                the palace, and boiled, and laid upon a silver dish, as was done 
                to<br>
                all our ancestors; and you may be sure it must be something very<br>
                uncommon.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The nobleman's castle, perhaps, has fallen to decay,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                snail-father, or the burdock wood may have grown out. You need 
                not<br>
                be in a hurry; you are always so impatient, and the youngster 
                is<br>
                getting just the same. He has been three days creeping to the 
                top of<br>
                that stalk. I feel quite giddy when I look at him.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You must not scold him,&quot; said the mother-snail; &quot;he 
                creeps so<br>
                very carefully. He will be the joy of our home; and we old folks<br>
                have nothing else to live for. But have you ever thought where 
                we<br>
                are to get a wife for him? Do you think that farther out in the 
                wood<br>
                there may be others of our race?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There may be black snails, no doubt,&quot; said the old 
                snail;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;black snails without houses; but they are so vulgar and 
                conceited<br>
                too. But we can give the ants a commission; they run here and 
                there,<br>
                as if they all had so much business to get through. They, most 
                likely,<br>
                will know of a wife for our youngster.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I certainly know a most beautiful bride,&quot; said one 
                of the ants;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;but I fear it would not do, for she is a queen.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That does not matter,&quot; said the old snail; &quot;has 
                she a house?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;She has a palace,&quot; replied the ant,- &quot;a most 
                beautiful ant-palace<br>
                with seven hundred passages.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thank-you,&quot; said the mother-snail; &quot;but our boy 
                shall not go to<br>
                live in an ant-hill. If you know of nothing better, we will give 
                the<br>
                commission to the white gnats; they fly about in rain and sunshine;<br>
                they know the burdock wood from one end to the other.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We have a wife for him,&quot; said the gnats; &quot;a hundred 
                man-steps<br>
                from here there is a little snail with a house, sitting on a<br>
                gooseberry-bush; she is quite alone, and old enough to be married.<br>
                It is only a hundred man-steps from here.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Then let her come to him,&quot; said the old people. &quot;He 
                has the whole<br>
                burdock forest; she has only a bush.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So they brought the little lady-snail. She took eight days to<br>
                perform the journey; but that was just as it ought to be; for 
                it<br>
                showed her to be one of the right breeding. And then they had 
                a<br>
                wedding. Six glow-worms gave as much light as they could; but 
                in other respects it was all very quiet; for the old snails could 
                not bear<br>
                festivities or a crowd. But a beautiful speech was made by the<br>
                mother-snail. The father could not speak; he was too much overcome.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then they gave the whole burdock forest to the young snails as 
                an<br>
                inheritance, and repeated what they had so often said, that it 
                was the<br>
                finest place in the world, and that if they led upright and<br>
                honorable lives, and their family increased, they and their children<br>
                might some day be taken to the nobleman's palace, to be boiled<br>
                black, and laid on a silver dish. And when they had finished speaking,<br>
                the old couple crept into their houses, and came out no more; 
                for they slept.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The young snail pair now ruled in the forest, and had a numerous<br>
                progeny. But as the young ones were never boiled or laid in silver<br>
                dishes, they concluded that the castle had fallen into decay, 
                and that<br>
                all the people in the world were dead; and as nobody contradicted<br>
                them, they thought they must be right. And the rain fell upon 
                the<br>
                burdock-leaves, to play the drum for them, and the sun shone to<br>
                paint colors on the burdock forest for them, and they were very 
                happy; the whole family were entirely and perfectly happy.</p>

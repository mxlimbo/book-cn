              <p class="h" align="center"> THE ELF OF THE ROSE</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IN the midst of a garden grew a rose-tree, in full blossom, 
                and in<br>
                the prettiest of all the roses lived an elf. He was such a little<br>
                wee thing, that no human eye could see him. Behind each leaf of 
                the<br>
                rose he had a sleeping chamber. He was as well formed and as beautiful 
                as a little child could be, and had wings that reached from his 
                shoulders to his feet. Oh, what sweet fragrance there was in his<br>
                chambers! and how clean and beautiful were the walls! for they 
                were<br>
                the blushing leaves of the rose.<br>
              </p>
              <p>During the whole day he enjoyed himself in the warm sunshine, 
                flew<br>
                from flower to flower, and danced on the wings of the flying<br>
                butterflies. Then he took it into his head to measure how many 
                steps<br>
                he would have to go through the roads and cross-roads that are 
                on<br>
                the leaf of a linden-tree. What we call the veins on a leaf, he 
                took<br>
                for roads; ay, and very long roads they were for him; for before 
                he<br>
                had half finished his task, the sun went down: he had commenced 
                his<br>
                work too late. It became very cold, the dew fell, and the wind 
                blew;<br>
                so he thought the best thing he could do would be to return home. 
                He<br>
                hurried himself as much as he could; but he found the roses all 
                closed<br>
                up, and he could not get in; not a single rose stood open. The 
                poor<br>
                little elf was very much frightened. He had never before been 
                out at<br>
                night, but had always slumbered secretly behind the warm<br>
                rose-leaves. Oh, this would certainly be his death. At the other 
                end<br>
                of the garden, he knew there was an arbor, overgrown with beautiful<br>
                honey-suckles. The blossoms looked like large painted horns; and 
                he<br>
                thought to himself, he would go and sleep in one of these till 
                the<br>
                morning. He flew thither; but &quot;hush!&quot; two people were 
                in the arbor,- a<br>
                handsome young man and a beautiful lady. They sat side by side, 
                and<br>
                wished that they might never be obliged to part. They loved each 
                other much more than the best child can love its father and mother.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But we must part,&quot; said the young man; &quot;your 
                brother does not<br>
                like our engagement, and therefore he sends me so far away on<br>
                business, over mountains and seas. Farewell, my sweet bride; for 
                so<br>
                you are to me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And then they kissed each other, and the girl wept, and gave 
                him a<br>
                rose; but before she did so, she pressed a kiss upon it so fervently<br>
                that the flower opened. Then the little elf flew in, and leaned 
                his<br>
                head on the delicate, fragrant walls. Here he could plainly hear<br>
                them say, &quot;Farewell, farewell;&quot; and he felt that the 
                rose had been<br>
                placed on the young man's breast. Oh, how his heart did beat! 
                The<br>
                little elf could not go to sleep, it thumped so loudly. The young<br>
                man took it out as he walked through the dark wood alone, and 
                kissed the flower so often and so violently, that the little elf 
                was almost crushed. He could feel through the leaf how hot the 
                lips of the<br>
                young man were, and the rose had opened, as if from the heat of 
                the<br>
                noonday sun.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There came another man, who looked gloomy and wicked. He was 
                the wicked brother of the beautiful maiden. He drew out a sharp 
                knife, and while the other was kissing the rose, the wicked man 
                stabbed him to death; then he cut off his head, and buried it 
                with the body in the<br>
                soft earth under the linden-tree.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now he is gone, and will soon be forgotten,&quot; thought 
                the wicked<br>
                brother; &quot;he will never come back again. He was going on 
                a long<br>
                journey over mountains and seas; it is easy for a man to lose 
                his life<br>
                in such a journey. My sister will suppose he is dead; for he cannot<br>
                come back, and she will not dare to question me about him.&quot;<br>
                Then he scattered the dry leaves over the light earth with his<br>
                foot, and went home through the darkness; but he went not alone, 
                as he thought,- the little elf accompanied him. He sat in a dry 
                rolled-up<br>
                linden-leaf, which had fallen from the tree on to the wicked man's<br>
                head, as he was digging the grave. The hat was on the head now,<br>
                which made it very dark, and the little elf shuddered with fright<br>
                and indignation at the wicked deed.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was the dawn of morning before the wicked man reached home;<br>
                he took off his hat, and went into his sister's room. There lay 
                the<br>
                beautiful, blooming girl, dreaming of him whom she loved so, and 
                who was now, she supposed, travelling far away over mountain and 
                sea.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Her wicked brother stopped over her, and laughed hideously, as<br>
                fiends only can laugh. The dry leaf fell out of his hair upon 
                the<br>
                counterpane; but he did not notice it, and went to get a little<br>
                sleep during the early morning hours. But the elf slipped out 
                of the<br>
                withered leaf, placed himself by the ear of the sleeping girl, 
                and<br>
                told her, as in a dream, of the horrid murder; described the place<br>
                where her brother had slain her lover, and buried his body; and 
                told<br>
                her of the linden-tree, in full blossom, that stood close by.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That you may not think this is only a dream that I have 
                told<br>
                you,&quot; he said, &quot;you will find on your bed a withered 
                leaf.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then she awoke, and found it there. Oh, what bitter tears she<br>
                shed! and she could not open her heart to any one for relief.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The window stood open the whole day, and the little elf could<br>
                easily have reached the roses, or any of the flowers; but he could 
                not<br>
                find it in his heart to leave one so afflicted. In the window 
                stood<br>
                a bush bearing monthly roses. He seated himself in one of the 
                flowers, and gazed on the poor girl. Her brother often came into 
                the room, and would be quite cheerful, in spite of his base conduct; 
                so she dare not say a word to him of her heart's grief.<br>
              </p>
              <p>As soon as night came on, she slipped out of the house, and went<br>
                into the wood, to the spot where the linden-tree stood; and after<br>
                removing the leaves from the earth, she turned it up, and there<br>
                found him who had been murdered. Oh, how she wept and prayed that 
                she also might die! Gladly would she have taken the body home 
                with her; but that was impossible; so she took up the poor head 
                with the closed eyes, kissed the cold lips, and shook the mould 
                out of the<br>
                beautiful hair.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I will keep this,&quot; said she; and as soon as she had 
                covered the<br>
                body again with the earth and leaves, she took the head and a 
                little<br>
                sprig of jasmine that bloomed in the wood, near the spot where 
                he<br>
                was buried, and carried them home with her. As soon as she was 
                in<br>
                her room, she took the largest flower-pot she could find, and 
                in<br>
                this she placed the head of the dead man, covered it up with earth,<br>
                and planted the twig of jasmine in it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Farewell, farewell,&quot; whispered the little elf. He 
                could not any<br>
                longer endure to witness all this agony of grief, he therefore 
                flew<br>
                away to his own rose in the garden. But the rose was faded; only 
                a few dry leaves still clung to the green hedge behind it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Alas! how soon all that is good and beautiful passes away,&quot;<br>
                sighed the elf.<br>
              </p>
              <p>After a while he found another rose, which became his home, for<br>
                among its delicate fragrant leaves he could dwell in safety. Every<br>
                morning he flew to the window of the poor girl, and always found 
                her<br>
                weeping by the flower pot. The bitter tears fell upon the jasmine<br>
                twig, and each day, as she became paler and paler, the sprig<br>
                appeared to grow greener and fresher. One shoot after another 
                sprouted forth, and little white buds blossomed, which the poor 
                girl fondly kissed. But her wicked brother scolded her, and asked 
                her if she was going mad. He could not imagine why she was weeping 
                over that flower-pot, and it annoyed him. He did not know whose 
                closed eyes were there, nor what red lips were fading beneath 
                the earth. And one day she sat and leaned her head against the 
                flower-pot, and the little elf of the rose found her asleep. Then 
                he seated himself by her ear, talked to her of that evening in 
                the arbor, of the sweet perfume of<br>
                the rose, and the loves of the elves. Sweetly she dreamed, and 
                while<br>
                she dreamt, her life passed away calmly and gently, and her spirit 
                was<br>
                with him whom she loved, in heaven. And the jasmine opened its 
                large<br>
                white bells, and spread forth its sweet fragrance; it had no other 
                way<br>
                of showing its grief for the dead. But the wicked brother considered<br>
                the beautiful blooming plant as his own property, left to him 
                by his<br>
                sister, and he placed it in his sleeping room, close by his bed, 
                for<br>
                it was very lovely in appearance, and the fragrance sweet and<br>
                delightful. The little elf of the rose followed it, and flew from<br>
                flower to flower, telling each little spirit that dwelt in them 
                the<br>
                story of the murdered young man, whose head now formed part of 
                the earth beneath them, and of the wicked brother and the poor 
                sister. &quot;We know it,&quot; said each little spirit in the 
                flowers, &quot;we know it, for<br>
                have we not sprung from the eyes and lips of the murdered one. 
                We know it, we know it,&quot; and the flowers nodded with their 
                heads in a peculiar manner. The elf of the rose could not understand 
                how they could rest so quietly in the matter, so he flew to the 
                bees, who were gathering honey, and told them of the wicked brother. 
                And the bees told it to their queen, who commanded that the next 
                morning they should go and kill the murderer. But during the night, 
                the first after the<br>
                sister's death, while the brother was sleeping in his bed, close 
                to<br>
                where he had placed the fragrant jasmine, every flower cup opened, 
                and invisibly the little spirits stole out, armed with poisonous 
                spears.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They placed themselves by the ear of the sleeper, told him dreadful<br>
                dreams and then flew across his lips, and pricked his tongue with<br>
                their poisoned spears. &quot;Now have we revenged the dead,&quot; 
                said they, and flew back into the white bells of the jasmine flowers. 
                When the<br>
                morning came, and as soon as the window was opened, the rose elf, 
                with the queen bee, and the whole swarm of bees, rushed in to 
                kill him. But he was already dead. People were standing round 
                the bed, and saying that the scent of the jasmine had killed him. 
                Then the elf of the rose understood the revenge of the flowers, 
                and explained it to the queen bee, and she, with the whole swarm, 
                buzzed about the flower-pot. The bees could not be driven away. 
                Then a man took it up to remove it, and one of the bees stung 
                him in the hand, so that he let the flower-pot fall, and it was 
                broken to pieces. Then every one saw the whitened skull, and they 
                knew the dead man in the bed was a murderer. And the queen bee 
                hummed in the air, and sang of the revenge of the flowers, and 
                of the elf of the rose and said that behind the smallest leaf 
                dwells One, who can discover evil deeds, and punish them also.</p>

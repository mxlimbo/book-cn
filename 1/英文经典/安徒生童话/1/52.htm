              <p class="h" align="center"> THE FIR TREE</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> FAR down in the forest, where the warm sun and the fresh air<br>
                made a sweet resting-place, grew a pretty little fir-tree; and 
                yet<br>
                it was not happy, it wished so much to be tall like its companions-<br>
                the pines and firs which grew around it. The sun shone, and the 
                soft<br>
                air fluttered its leaves, and the little peasant children passed 
                by,<br>
                prattling merrily, but the fir-tree heeded them not. Sometimes 
                the<br>
                children would bring a large basket of raspberries or strawberries,<br>
                wreathed on a straw, and seat themselves near the fir-tree, and 
                say,<br>
                &quot;Is it not a pretty little tree?&quot; which made it feel 
                more unhappy than<br>
                before. And yet all this while the tree grew a notch or joint 
                taller<br>
                every year; for by the number of joints in the stem of a fir-tree 
                we<br>
                can discover its age. Still, as it grew, it complained, &quot;Oh! 
                how I<br>
                wish I were as tall as the other trees, then I would spread out 
                my<br>
                branches on every side, and my top would over-look the wide world. 
              </p>
              <p>I should have the birds building their nests on my boughs, and 
                when<br>
                the wind blew, I should bow with stately dignity like my tall 
                companions.&quot; The tree was so discontented, that it took no 
                pleasure in the warm sunshine, the birds, or the rosy clouds that 
                floated over<br>
                it morning and evening. Sometimes, in winter, when the snow lay<br>
                white and glittering on the ground, a hare would come springing 
                along, and jump right over the little tree; and then how mortified 
                it would feel! Two winters passed, and when the third arrived, 
                the tree had grown so tall that the hare was obliged to run round 
                it. Yet it<br>
                remained unsatisfied, and would exclaim, &quot;Oh, if I could 
                but keep on<br>
                growing tall and old! There is nothing else worth caring for in 
                the<br>
                world!&quot; In the autumn, as usual, the wood-cutters came and 
                cut down<br>
                several of the tallest trees, and the young fir-tree, which was 
                now<br>
                grown to its full height, shuddered as the noble trees fell to 
                the<br>
                earth with a crash. After the branches were lopped off, the trunks<br>
                looked so slender and bare, that they could scarcely be recognized.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then they were placed upon wagons, and drawn by horses out of 
                the<br>
                forest. &quot;Where were they going? What would become of them?&quot; 
                The<br>
                young fir-tree wished very much to know; so in the spring, when 
                the<br>
                swallows and the storks came, it asked, &quot;Do you know where 
                those trees were taken? Did you meet them?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The swallows knew nothing, but the stork, after a little<br>
                reflection, nodded his head, and said, &quot;Yes, I think I do. 
                I met<br>
                several new ships when I flew from Egypt, and they had fine masts 
                that smelt like fir. I think these must have been the trees; I 
                assure you<br>
                they were stately, very stately.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, how I wish I were tall enough to go on the sea,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                fir-tree. &quot;What is the sea, and what does it look like?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It would take too much time to explain,&quot; said the 
                stork, flying<br>
                quickly away.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Rejoice in thy youth,&quot; said the sunbeam; &quot;rejoice 
                in thy fresh<br>
                growth, and the young life that is in thee.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the wind kissed the tree, and the dew watered it with tears;<br>
                but the fir-tree regarded them not.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Christmas-time drew near, and many young trees were cut down, 
                some even smaller and younger than the fir-tree who enjoyed neither 
                rest nor peace with longing to leave its forest home. These young 
                trees, which were chosen for their beauty, kept their branches, 
                and were also laid on wagons and drawn by horses out of the forest.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Where are they going?&quot; asked the fir-tree. &quot;They 
                are not taller<br>
                than I am: indeed, one is much less; and why are the branches 
                not<br>
                cut off? Where are they going?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We know, we know,&quot; sang the sparrows; &quot;we have 
                looked in at the<br>
                windows of the houses in the town, and we know what is done with 
                them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They are dressed up in the most splendid manner. We have seen 
                them<br>
                standing in the middle of a warm room, and adorned with all sorts 
                of<br>
                beautiful things,- honey cakes, gilded apples, playthings, and 
                many<br>
                hundreds of wax tapers.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And then,&quot; asked the fir-tree, trembling through all 
                its<br>
                branches, &quot;and then what happens?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We did not see any more,&quot; said the sparrows; &quot;but 
                this was enough<br>
                for us.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I wonder whether anything so brilliant will ever happen 
                to me,&quot;<br>
                thought the fir-tree. &quot;It would be much better than crossing 
                the<br>
                sea. I long for it almost with pain. Oh! when will Christmas be<br>
                here? I am now as tall and well grown as those which were taken 
                away last year. Oh! that I were now laid on the wagon, or standing 
                in the warm room, with all that brightness and splendor around 
                me!<br>
                Something better and more beautiful is to come after, or the trees<br>
                would not be so decked out. Yes, what follows will be grander 
                and more splendid. What can it be? I am weary with longing. I 
                scarcely know how I feel.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Rejoice with us,&quot; said the air and the sunlight. &quot;Enjoy 
                thine own<br>
                bright life in the fresh air.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the tree would not rejoice, though it grew taller every day;<br>
                and, winter and summer, its dark-green foliage might be seen in 
                the<br>
                forest, while passers by would say, &quot;What a beautiful tree!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>A short time before Christmas, the discontented fir-tree was 
                the<br>
                first to fall. As the axe cut through the stem, and divided the<br>
                pith, the tree fell with a groan to the earth, conscious of pain 
                and<br>
                faintness, and forgetting all its anticipations of happiness, 
                in<br>
                sorrow at leaving its home in the forest. It knew that it should 
                never<br>
                again see its dear old companions, the trees, nor the little bushes<br>
                and many-colored flowers that had grown by its side; perhaps not<br>
                even the birds. Neither was the journey at all pleasant. The tree<br>
                first recovered itself while being unpacked in the courtyard of 
                a<br>
                house, with several other trees; and it heard a man say, &quot;We 
                only want one, and this is the prettiest.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then came two servants in grand livery, and carried the fir-tree<br>
                into a large and beautiful apartment. On the walls hung pictures,<br>
                and near the great stove stood great china vases, with lions on 
                the<br>
                lids. There were rocking chairs, silken sofas, large tables, covered<br>
                with pictures, books, and playthings, worth a great deal of money,- 
                at<br>
                least, the children said so. Then the fir-tree was placed in a 
                large<br>
                tub, full of sand; but green baize hung all around it, so that 
                no<br>
                one could see it was a tub, and it stood on a very handsome carpet.<br>
                How the fir-tree trembled! &quot;What was going to happen to him 
                now?&quot; Some young ladies came, and the servants helped them 
                to adorn the tree.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On one branch they hung little bags cut out of colored paper, 
                and each bag was filled with sweetmeats; from other branches hung 
                gilded apples and walnuts, as if they had grown there; and above, 
                and all round, were hundreds of red, blue, and white tapers, which 
                were fastened on the branches. Dolls, exactly like real babies, 
                were placed under the green leaves,- the tree had never seen such 
                things before,- and at the very top was fastened a glittering 
                star, made of tinsel. Oh, it was very beautiful!<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This evening,&quot; they all exclaimed, &quot;how bright 
                it will be!&quot;<br>
                &quot;Oh, that the evening were come,&quot; thought the tree, 
                &quot;and the tapers<br>
                lighted! then I shall know what else is going to happen. Will 
                the<br>
                trees of the forest come to see me? I wonder if the sparrows will 
                peep<br>
                in at the windows as they fly? shall I grow faster here, and keep 
                on<br>
                all these ornaments summer and winter?&quot; But guessing was 
                of very<br>
                little use; it made his bark ache, and this pain is as bad for 
                a<br>
                slender fir-tree, as headache is for us. At last the tapers were<br>
                lighted, and then what a glistening blaze of light the tree presented!<br>
                It trembled so with joy in all its branches, that one of the candles<br>
                fell among the green leaves and burnt some of them. &quot;Help! 
                help!&quot;<br>
                exclaimed the young ladies, but there was no danger, for they<br>
                quickly extinguished the fire. After this, the tree tried not 
                to<br>
                tremble at all, though the fire frightened him; he was so anxious<br>
                not to hurt any of the beautiful ornaments, even while their<br>
                brilliancy dazzled him. And now the folding doors were thrown 
                open,<br>
                and a troop of children rushed in as if they intended to upset 
                the<br>
                tree; they were followed more silently by their elders. For a 
                moment<br>
                the little ones stood silent with astonishment, and then they<br>
                shouted for joy, till the room rang, and they danced merrily round 
                the<br>
                tree, while one present after another was taken from it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What are they doing? What will happen next?&quot; thought 
                the fir.<br>
                At last the candles burnt down to the branches and were put out.<br>
                Then the children received permission to plunder the tree.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Oh, how they rushed upon it, till the branches cracked, and had 
                it<br>
                not been fastened with the glistening star to the ceiling, it 
                must<br>
                have been thrown down. The children then danced about with their<br>
                pretty toys, and no one noticed the tree, except the children's 
                maid<br>
                who came and peeped among the branches to see if an apple or a 
                fig had been forgotten.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;A story, a story,&quot; cried the children, pulling a little 
                fat man<br>
                towards the tree.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now we shall be in the green shade,&quot; said the man, 
                as he seated<br>
                himself under it, &quot;and the tree will have the pleasure of 
                hearing<br>
                also, but I shall only relate one story; what shall it be?<br>
              </p>
              <p>Ivede-Avede, or Humpty Dumpty, who fell down stairs, but soon 
                got up again, and at last married a princess.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ivede-Avede,&quot; cried some. &quot;Humpty Dumpty,&quot; 
                cried others, and<br>
                there was a fine shouting and crying out. But the fir-tree remained<br>
                quite still, and thought to himself, &quot;Shall I have anything 
                to do with<br>
                all this?&quot; but he had already amused them as much as they 
                wished. </p>
              <p>Then the old man told them the story of Humpty Dumpty, how he 
                fell down stairs, and was raised up again, and married a princess. 
                And the<br>
                children clapped their hands and cried, &quot;Tell another, tell 
                another,&quot; for they wanted to hear the story of &quot;Ivede-Avede;&quot; 
                but they only had &quot;Humpty Dumpty.&quot; After this the fir-tree 
                became quite silent and thoughtful; never had the birds in the 
                forest told such tales as &quot;Humpty Dumpty,&quot; who fell 
                down stairs, and yet married a<br>
                princess.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah! yes, so it happens in the world,&quot; thought the 
                fir-tree; he<br>
                believed it all, because it was related by such a nice man. &quot;Ah!<br>
                well,&quot; he thought, &quot;who knows? perhaps I may fall down 
                too, and<br>
                marry a princess;&quot; and he looked forward joyfully to the 
                next evening,<br>
                expecting to be again decked out with lights and playthings, gold<br>
                and fruit. &quot;To-morrow I will not tremble,&quot; thought he; 
                &quot;I will enjoy<br>
                all my splendor, and I shall hear the story of Humpty Dumpty again,<br>
                and perhaps Ivede-Avede.&quot; And the tree remained quiet and 
                thoughtful all night. In the morning the servants and the housemaid 
                came in. &quot;Now,&quot; thought the fir, &quot;all my splendor 
                is going to begin again.&quot; But they dragged him out of the 
                room and up stairs to the garret, and threw him on the floor, 
                in a dark corner, where no daylight shone, and there they left 
                him. &quot;What does this mean?&quot; thought the tree, &quot;what 
                am I to do here? I can hear nothing in a place like this,&quot; 
                and he had time enough to think, for days and nights passed and 
                no one came near him, and when at last somebody did come, it was 
                only to put away large boxes in a corner. So the tree was completely 
                hidden from sight as if it had never existed. &quot;It is winter 
                now,&quot; thought the tree, &quot;the ground is hard and covered 
                with snow, so that people cannot plant me. I shall be sheltered 
                here, I dare say, until spring comes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>How thoughtful and kind everybody is to me! Still I wish this 
                place<br>
                were not so dark, as well as lonely, with not even a little hare 
                to<br>
                look at. How pleasant it was out in the forest while the snow 
                lay on<br>
                the ground, when the hare would run by, yes, and jump over me 
                too,<br>
                although I did not like it then. Oh! it is terrible lonely here.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Squeak, squeak,&quot; said a little mouse, creeping cautiously 
                towards<br>
                the tree; then came another; and they both sniffed at the fir-tree 
                and<br>
                crept between the branches.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, it is very cold,&quot; said the little mouse, &quot;or 
                else we should<br>
                be so comfortable here, shouldn't we, you old fir-tree?&quot;<br>
                &quot;I am not old,&quot; said the fir-tree, &quot;there are many 
                who are older<br>
                than I am.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Where do you come from? and what do you know?&quot; asked 
                the mice,who were full of curiosity. &quot;Have you seen the most 
                beautiful places in the world, and can you tell us all about them? 
                and have you been in the storeroom, where cheeses lie on the shelf, 
                and hams hang from the ceiling? One can run about on tallow candles 
                there, and go in thin and come out fat.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I know nothing of that place,&quot; said the fir-tree, 
                &quot;but I know the<br>
                wood where the sun shines and the birds sing.&quot; And then the 
                tree<br>
                told the little mice all about its youth. They had never heard 
                such an<br>
                account in their lives; and after they had listened to it attentively,<br>
                they said, &quot;What a number of things you have seen? you must 
                have<br>
                been very happy.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Happy!&quot; exclaimed the fir-tree, and then as he reflected 
                upon<br>
                what he had been telling them, he said, &quot;Ah, yes! after all 
                those were<br>
                happy days.&quot; But when he went on and related all about<br>
                Christmas-eve, and how he had been dressed up with cakes and lights,the 
                mice said, &quot;How happy you must have been, you old fir-tree.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I am not old at all,&quot; replied the tree, &quot;I only 
                came from the<br>
                forest this winter, I am now checked in my growth.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What splendid stories you can relate,&quot; said the little 
                mice.<br>
                And the next night four other mice came with them to hear what 
                the<br>
                tree had to tell. The more he talked the more he remembered, and<br>
                then he thought to himself, &quot;Those were happy days, but they 
                may<br>
                come again. Humpty Dumpty fell down stairs, and yet he married 
                the<br>
                princess; perhaps I may marry a princess too.&quot; And the fir-tree<br>
                thought of the pretty little birch-tree that grew in the forest, 
                which<br>
                was to him a real beautiful princess.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Who is Humpty Dumpty?&quot; asked the little mice. And 
                then the tree<br>
                related the whole story; he could remember every single word, 
                and<br>
                the little mice was so delighted with it, that they were ready 
                to jump<br>
                to the top of the tree. The next night a great many more mice 
                made<br>
                their appearance, and on Sunday two rats came with them; but they<br>
                said, it was not a pretty story at all, and the little mice were<br>
                very sorry, for it made them also think less of it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Do you know only one story?&quot; asked the rats.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Only one,&quot; replied the fir-tree; &quot;I heard it 
                on the happiest<br>
                evening of my life; but I did not know I was so happy at the time.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We think it is a very miserable story,&quot; said the rats. 
                &quot;Don't you<br>
                know any story about bacon, or tallow in the storeroom.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No,&quot; replied the tree.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Many thanks to you then,&quot; replied the rats, and they 
                marched off.<br>
                The little mice also kept away after this, and the tree sighed,<br>
                and said, &quot;It was very pleasant when the merry little mice 
                sat round<br>
                me and listened while I talked. Now that is all passed too. However, 
                I<br>
                shall consider myself happy when some one comes to take me out 
                of this place.&quot; But would this ever happen? Yes; one morning 
                people came to clear out the garret, the boxes were packed away, 
                and the tree was pulled out of the corner, and thrown roughly 
                on the garret floor; then the servant dragged it out upon the 
                staircase where the daylight shone. &quot;Now life is beginning 
                again,&quot; said the tree, rejoicing in the sunshine and fresh 
                air. Then it was carried down stairs and<br>
                taken into the courtyard so quickly, that it forgot to think of<br>
                itself, and could only look about, there was so much to be seen. 
                The<br>
                court was close to a garden, where everything looked blooming. 
                Fresh and fragrant roses hung over the little palings. The linden-trees 
                were in blossom; while the swallows flew here and there, crying, 
                &quot;Twit, twit, twit, my mate is coming,&quot;- but it was not 
                the fir-tree they<br>
                meant. &quot;Now I shall live,&quot; cried the tree, joyfully 
                spreading out<br>
                its branches; but alas! they were all withered and yellow, and 
                it<br>
                lay in a corner amongst weeds and nettles. The star of gold paper<br>
                still stuck in the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine. 
                In<br>
                the same courtyard two of the merry children were playing who 
                had<br>
                danced round the tree at Christmas, and had been so happy. The<br>
                youngest saw the gilded star, and ran and pulled it off the tree.<br>
                &quot;Look what is sticking to the ugly old fir-tree,&quot; said 
                the child,<br>
                treading on the branches till they crackled under his boots. And 
                the<br>
                tree saw all the fresh bright flowers in the garden, and then 
                looked<br>
                at itself, and wished it had remained in the dark corner of the<br>
                garret. It thought of its fresh youth in the forest, of the merry<br>
                Christmas evening, and of the little mice who had listened to 
                the<br>
                story of &quot;Humpty Dumpty.&quot; &quot;Past! past!&quot; said 
                the old tree; &quot;Oh, had<br>
                I but enjoyed myself while I could have done so! but now it is 
                too<br>
                late.&quot; Then a lad came and chopped the tree into small pieces, 
                till<br>
                a large bundle lay in a heap on the ground. The pieces were placed<br>
                in a fire under the copper, and they quickly blazed up brightly, 
                while<br>
                the tree sighed so deeply that each sigh was like a pistol-shot.<br>
                Then the children, who were at play, came and seated themselves 
                in<br>
                front of the fire, and looked at it and cried, &quot;Pop, pop.&quot; 
                But at each<br>
                &quot;pop,&quot; which was a deep sigh, the tree was thinking 
                of a summer day in the forest; and of Christmas evening, and of 
                &quot;Humpty Dumpty,&quot; the only story it had ever heard or 
                knew how to relate, till at last it was<br>
                consumed. The boys still played in the garden, and the youngest 
                wore<br>
                the golden star on his breast, with which the tree had been adorned<br>
                during the happiest evening of its existence. Now all was past; 
                the<br>
                tree's life was past, and the story also,- for all stories must 
                come<br>
                to an end at last.</p>

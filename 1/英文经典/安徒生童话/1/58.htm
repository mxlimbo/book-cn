              <p  align="center"> FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</p>
              <p class="h" align="center"> THE GOLDEN TREASURE</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THE drummer's wife went into the church. She saw the new altar<br>
                with the painted pictures and the carved angels. Those upon the 
                canvas and in the glory over the altar were just as beautiful 
                as the carved ones; and they were painted and gilt into the bargain. 
                Their hair gleamed golden in the sunshine, lovely to behold; but 
                the real<br>
                sunshine was more beautiful still. It shone redder, clearer through<br>
                the dark trees, when the sun went down. It was lovely thus to 
                look<br>
                at the sunshine of heaven. And she looked at the red sun, and 
                she<br>
                thought about it so deeply, and thought of the little one whom 
                the<br>
                stork was to bring, and the wife of the drummer was very cheerful, 
                and looked and looked, and wished that the child might have a 
                gleam of sunshine given to it, so that it might at least become 
                like one of the<br>
                shining angels over the altar.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And when she really had the little child in her arms, and held<br>
                it up to its father, then it was like one of the angels in the<br>
                church to behold, with hair like gold- the gleam of the setting 
                sun<br>
                was upon it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;My golden treasure, my riches, my sunshine!&quot; said 
                the mother; and<br>
                she kissed the shining locks, and it sounded like music and song 
                in<br>
                the room of the drummer; and there was joy, and life, and movement.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The drummer beat a roll- a roll of joy. And the Drum said- the<br>
                Fire-drum, that was beaten when there was a fire in the town:<br>
                &quot;Red hair! the little fellow has red hair! Believe the drum, 
                and<br>
                not what your mother says! Rub-a dub, rub-a dub!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the town repeated what the Fire-drum had said.<br>
                The boy was taken to church, the boy was christened. There was<br>
                nothing much to be said about his name; he was called Peter. The 
                whole town, and the Drum too, called him Peter the drummer's boy 
                with the red hair; but his mother kissed his red hair, and called 
                him her<br>
                golden treasure.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the hollow way in the clayey bank, many had scratched their<br>
                names as a remembrance.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Celebrity is always something!&quot; said the drummer; 
                and so he<br>
                scratched his own name there, and his little son's name likewise.<br>
                And the swallows came. They had, on their long journey, seen<br>
                more durable characters engraven on rocks, and on the walls of 
                the<br>
                temples in Hindostan, mighty deeds of great kings, immortal names,<br>
                so old that no one now could read or speak them. Remarkable celebrity!<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the clayey bank the martens built their nest. They bored<br>
                holes in the deep declivity, and the splashing rain and the thin<br>
                mist came and crumbled and washed the names away, and the drummer's 
                name also, and that of his little son.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Peter's name will last a full year and a half longer!&quot; 
                said the<br>
                father.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Fool!&quot; thought the Fire-drum; but it only said, &quot;Dub, 
                dub, dub,<br>
                rub-a-dub!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>He was a boy full of life and gladness, this drummer's son with<br>
                the red hair. He had a lovely voice. He could sing, and he sang 
                like a<br>
                bird in the woodland. There was melody, and yet no melody.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He must become a chorister boy,&quot; said his mother. 
                &quot;He shall<br>
                sing in the church, and stand among the beautiful gilded angels 
                who<br>
                are like him!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Fiery cat!&quot; said some of the witty ones of the town.<br>
                The Drum heard that from the neighbors' wives.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Don't go home, Peter,&quot; cried the street boys. &quot;If 
                you sleep in<br>
                the garret, there'll be a fire in the house, and the fire-drum 
                will<br>
                have to be beaten.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Look out for the drumsticks,&quot; replied Peter; and, 
                small as he<br>
                was, he ran up boldly, and gave the foremost such a punch in the<br>
                body with his fist, that the fellow lost his legs and tumbled 
                over,<br>
                and the others took their legs off with themselves very rapidly.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The town musician was very genteel and fine. He was the son of 
                the<br>
                royal plate-washer. He was very fond of Peter, and would sometimes<br>
                take him to his home; and he gave him a violin, and taught him 
                to play<br>
                it. It seemed as if the whole art lay in the boy's fingers; and 
                he<br>
                wanted to be more than a drummer- he wanted to become musician 
                to<br>
                the town.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I'll be a soldier,&quot; said Peter; for he was still quite 
                a little<br>
                lad, and it seemed to him the finest thing in the world to carry 
                a<br>
                gun, and to be able to march one, two- one, two, and to wear a 
                uniform and a sword.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah, you learn to long for the drum-skin, drum, dum, dum!&quot; 
                said<br>
                the Drum.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, if he could only march his way up to be a general!&quot; 
                observed<br>
                his father; &quot;but before he can do that, there must be war.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Heaven forbid!&quot; said his mother.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We have nothing to lose,&quot; remarked the father.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, we have my boy,&quot; she retorted.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But suppose he came back a general!&quot; said the father.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Without arms and legs!&quot; cried the mother. &quot;No, 
                I would rather<br>
                keep my golden treasure with me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Drum, dum, dum!&quot; The Fire-drum and all the other drums 
                were<br>
                beating, for war had come. The soldiers all set out, and the son 
                of<br>
                the drummer followed them. &quot;Red-head. Golden treasure!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The mother wept; the father in fancy saw him &quot;famous;&quot; 
                the town<br>
                musician was of opinion that he ought not to go to war, but should<br>
                stay at home and learn music.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Red-head,&quot; said the soldiers, and little Peter laughed; 
                but<br>
                when one of them sometimes said to another, &quot;Foxey,&quot; 
                he would bite his teeth together and look another way- into the 
                wide world. He did not care for the nickname.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The boy was active, pleasant of speech, and good-humored; that<br>
                is the best canteen, said his old comrades.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And many a night he had to sleep under the open sky, wet through<br>
                with the driving rain or the falling mist; but his good humor 
                never<br>
                forsook him. The drum-sticks sounded, &quot;Rub-a-dub, all up, 
                all up!&quot;<br>
                Yes, he was certainly born to be a drummer.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The day of battle dawned. The sun had not yet risen, but the<br>
                morning was come. The air was cold, the battle was hot; there 
                was mist in the air, but still more gunpowder-smoke. The bullets 
                and shells<br>
                flew over the soldiers' heads, and into their heads- into their 
                bodies<br>
                and limbs; but still they pressed forward. Here or there one or<br>
                other of them would sink on his knees, with bleeding temples and 
                a<br>
                face as white as chalk. The little drummer still kept his healthy<br>
                color; he had suffered no damage; he looked cheerfully at the 
                dog of<br>
                the regiment, which was jumping along as merrily as if the whole 
                thing<br>
                had been got up for his amusement, and as if the bullets were 
                only<br>
                flying about that he might have a game of play with them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;March! Forward! March!&quot; This, was the word of command 
                for the<br>
                drum. The word had not yet been given to fall back, though they<br>
                might have done so, and perhaps there would have been much sense 
                in it; and now at last the word &quot;Retire&quot; was given; 
                but our little<br>
                drummer beat &quot;Forward! march!&quot; for he had understood 
                the command thus, and the soldiers obeyed the sound of the drum. 
                That was a good roll, and proved the summons to victory for the 
                men, who had already begun to give way.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Life and limb were lost in the battle. Bombshells tore away the<br>
                flesh in red strips; bombshells lit up into a terrible glow the<br>
                strawheaps to which the wounded had dragged themselves, to lie<br>
                untended for many hours, perhaps for all the hours they had to 
                live.<br>
                It's no use thinking of it; and yet one cannot help thinking of<br>
                it, even far away in the peaceful town. The drummer and his wife<br>
                also thought of it, for Peter was at the war.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now, I'm tired of these complaints,&quot; said the Fire-drum.<br>
                Again the day of battle dawned; the sun had not yet risen, but<br>
                it was morning. The drummer and his wife were asleep. They had 
                been talking about their son, as, indeed, they did almost every 
                night,<br>
                for he was out yonder in God's hand. And the father dreamt that 
                the<br>
                war was over, that the soldiers had returned home, and that Peter 
                wore a silver cross on his breast. But the mother dreamt that 
                she had<br>
                gone into the church, and had seen the painted pictures and the 
                carved angels with the gilded hair, and her own dear boy, the 
                golden treasure of her heart, who was standing among the angels 
                in white robes, singing so sweetly, as surely only the angels 
                can sing; and that he had soared up with them into the sunshine, 
                and nodded so kindly at his mother.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;My golden treasure!&quot; she cried out; and she awoke. 
                &quot;Now the<br>
                good God has taken him to Himself!&quot; She folded her hands, 
                and hid<br>
                her face in the cotton curtains of the bed, and wept. &quot;Where 
                does he<br>
                rest now? among the many in the big grave that they have dug for 
                the<br>
                dead? Perhaps he's in the water in the marsh! Nobody knows his<br>
                grave; no holy words have been read over it!&quot; And the Lord's 
                Prayer<br>
                went inaudibly over her lips; she bowed her head, and was so weary<br>
                that she went to sleep.</p>
              <p> And the days went by, in life as in dreams!<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was evening. Over the battle-field a rainbow spread, which<br>
                touched the forest and the deep marsh.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It has been said, and is preserved in popular belief, that where<br>
                the rainbow touches the earth a treasure lies buried, a golden<br>
                treasure; and here there was one. No one but his mother thought 
                of the little drummer, and therefore she dreamt of him.</p>
              <p> And the days went by, in life as in dreams!<br>
                Not a hair of his head had been hurt, not a golden hair.<br>
                &quot;Drum-ma-rum! drum-ma-rum! there he is!&quot; the Drum might 
                have said, and his mother might have sung, if she had seen or 
                dreamt it.<br>
                With hurrah and song, adorned with green wreaths of victory,<br>
                they came home, as the war was at an end, and peace had been signed.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The dog of the regiment sprang on in front with large bounds, 
                and made the way three times as long for himself as it really 
                was.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And days and weeks went by, and Peter came into his parents' 
                room.<br>
                He was as brown as a wild man, and his eyes were bright, and his<br>
                face beamed like sunshine. And his mother held him in her arms; 
                she<br>
                kissed his lips, his forehead, and his red hair. She had her boy<br>
                back again; he had not a silver cross on his breast, as his father 
                had<br>
                dreamt, but he had sound limbs, a thing the mother had not dreamt. 
              </p>
              <p>And what a rejoicing was there! They laughed and they wept; and 
                Peter embraced the old Fire-drum.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There stands the old skeleton still!&quot; he said.<br>
                And the father beat a roll upon it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;One would think that a great fire had broken out here,&quot; 
                said<br>
                the Fire-drum. &quot;Bright day! fire in the heart! golden treasure! 
                skrat!<br>
                skr-r-at! skr-r-r-r-at!&quot;</p>
              <p> And what then? What then!- Ask the town musician.<br>
                &quot;Peter's far outgrowing the drum,&quot; he said. &quot;Peter 
                will be greater<br>
                than I.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And yet he was the son of a royal plate-washer; but all that 
                he<br>
                had learned in half a lifetime, Peter learned in half a year.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There was something so merry about him, something so truly<br>
                kind-hearted. His eyes gleamed, and his hair gleamed too- there 
                was no denying that!<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He ought to have his hair dyed,&quot; said the neighbor's 
                wife.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That answered capitally with the policeman's daughter, 
                and she got<br>
                a husband.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But her hair turned as green as duckweed, and was always 
                having<br>
                to be colored up.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;She knows how to manage for herself,&quot; said the neighbors, 
                &quot;and so<br>
                can Peter. He comes to the most genteel houses, even to the<br>
                burgomaster's where he gives Miss Charlotte piano-forte lessons.&quot;<br>
                He could play! He could play, fresh out of his heart, the most<br>
                charming pieces, that had never been put upon music-paper. He 
                played in the bright nights, and in the dark nights, too. The 
                neighbors<br>
                declared it was unbearable, and the Fire-drum was of the same 
                opinion.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He played until his thoughts soared up, and burst forth in great<br>
                plans for the future:<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;To be famous!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And burgomaster's Charlotte sat at the piano. Her delicate fingers<br>
                danced over the keys, and made them ring into Peter's heart. It 
                seemed too much for him to bear; and this happened not once, but 
                many times; and at last one day he seized the delicate fingers 
                and the<br>
                white hand, and kissed it, and looked into her great brown eyes.<br>
                Heaven knows what he said; but we may be allowed to guess at it.<br>
                Charlotte blushed to guess at it. She reddened from brow to neck,<br>
                and answered not a single word; and then strangers came into the 
                room, and one of them was the state councillor's son. He had a 
                lofty white forehead, and carried it so high that it seemed to 
                go back into his neck. And Peter sat by her a long time, and she 
                looked at him with<br>
                gentle eyes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>At home that evening he spoke of travel in the wide world, and<br>
                of the golden treasure that lay hidden for him in his violin.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;To be famous!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Tum-me-lum, tum-me-lum, tum-me-lum!&quot; said the Fire-drum. 
                &quot;Peter<br>
                has gone clear out of his wits. I think there must be a fire in 
                the<br>
                house.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Next day the mother went to market.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Shall I tell you news, Peter?&quot; she asked when she 
                came home. &quot;A<br>
                capital piece of news. Burgomaster's Charlotte has engaged herself<br>
                to the state councillor's son; the betrothal took place yesterday<br>
                evening.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No!&quot; cried Peter, and he sprang up from his chair. 
                But his mother<br>
                persisted in saying &quot;Yes.&quot; She had heard it from the 
                baker's wife,<br>
                whose husband had it from the burgomaster's own mouth<br>
                And Peter became as pale as death, and sat down again.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Good Heaven! what's the matter with you?&quot; asked his 
                mother.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Nothing, nothing; only leave me to myself,&quot; he answered 
                but the<br>
                tears were running down his cheeks.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;My sweet child, my golden treasure!&quot; cried the mother, 
                and she<br>
                wept; but the Fire-drum sang, not out loud, but inwardly.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Charlotte's gone! Charlotte's gone! and now the song is 
                done.&quot;<br>
                But the song was not done; there were many more verses in it, 
                long<br>
                verses, the most beautiful verses, the golden treasures of a life.</p>
              <p> &quot;She behaves like a mad woman,&quot; said the neighbor's 
                wife. &quot;All the<br>
                world is to see the letters she gets from her golden treasure, 
                and<br>
                to read the words that are written in the papers about his violin<br>
                playing. And he sends her money too, and that's very useful to 
                her<br>
                since she has been a widow.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He plays before emperors and kings,&quot; said the town 
                musician. &quot;I<br>
                never had that fortune, but he's my pupil, and he does not forget<br>
                his old master.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And his mother said,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;His father dreamt that Peter came home from the war with 
                a silver<br>
                cross. He did not gain one in the war, but it is still more<br>
                difficult to gain one in this way. Now he has the cross of honor. 
                If<br>
                his father had only lived to see it!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He's grown famous!&quot; said the Fire-drum, and all his 
                native town<br>
                said the same thing, for the drummer's son, Peter with the red 
                hair-<br>
                Peter whom they had known as a little boy, running about in wooden<br>
                shoes, and then as a drummer, playing for the dancers- was become<br>
                famous!<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He played at our house before he played in the presence 
                of<br>
                kings,&quot; said the burgomaster's wife. &quot;At that time he 
                was quite<br>
                smitten with Charlotte. He was always of an aspiring turn. At 
                that<br>
                time he was saucy and an enthusiast. My husband laughed when he<br>
                heard of the foolish affair, and now our Charlotte is a state<br>
                councillor's wife.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>A golden treasure had been hidden in the heart and soul of the<br>
                poor child, who had beaten the roll as a drummer- a roll of victory<br>
                for those who had been ready to retreat. There was a golden treasure<br>
                in his bosom, the power of sound; it burst forth on his violin 
                as if<br>
                the instrument had been a complete organ, and as if all the elves 
                of a<br>
                midsummer night were dancing across the strings. In its sounds 
                were<br>
                heard the piping of the thrush and the full clear note of the 
                human<br>
                voice; therefore the sound brought rapture to every heart, and 
                carried<br>
                his name triumphant through the land. That was a great firebrand-<br>
                the firebrand of inspiration.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And then he looks so splendid!&quot; said the young ladies 
                and the old<br>
                ladies too; and the oldest of all procured an album for famous 
                locks<br>
                of hair, wholly and solely that she might beg a lock of his rich<br>
                splendid hair, that treasure, that golden treasure.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the son came into the poor room of the drummer, elegant as 
                a<br>
                prince, happier than a king. His eyes were as clear and his face 
                was<br>
                as radiant as sunshine; and he held his mother in his arms, and 
                she<br>
                kissed his mouth, and wept as blissfully as any one can weep for<br>
                joy; and he nodded at every old piece of furniture in the room, 
                at the<br>
                cupboard with the tea-cups, and at the flower-vase. He nodded 
                at the<br>
                sleeping-bench, where he had slept as a little boy; but the old<br>
                Fire-drum he brought out, and dragged it into the middle of the<br>
                room, and said to it and to his mother:<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;My father would have beaten a famous roll this evening. 
                Now I<br>
                must do it!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And he beat a thundering roll-call on the instrument, and the 
                Drum<br>
                felt so highly honored that the parchment burst with exultation.<br>
                <br>
                &quot;He has a splendid touch!&quot; said the Drum. &quot;I've 
                a remembrance of<br>
                him now that will last. I expect that the same thing will happen 
                to<br>
                his mother, from pure joy over her golden treasure.&quot;<br>
                And this is the story of the Golden Treasure.</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> IN A THOUSAND YEARS</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> YES, in a thousand years people will fly on the wings of steam<br>
                through the air, over the ocean! The young inhabitants of America 
                will<br>
                become visitors of old Europe. They will come over to see the<br>
                monuments and the great cities, which will then be in ruins, just 
                as<br>
                we in our time make pilgrimages to the tottering splendors of 
                Southern Asia. In a thousand years they will come!<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Thames, the Danube, and the Rhine still roll their course,<br>
                Mont Blanc stands firm with its snow-capped summit, and the Northern 
                Lights gleam over the land of the North; but generation after<br>
                generation has become dust, whole rows of the mighty of the moment 
                are forgotten, like those who already slumber under the hill on 
                which<br>
                the rich trader, whose ground it is, has built a bench, on which 
                he<br>
                can sit and look out across his waving corn fields.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;To Europe!&quot; cry the young sons of America; &quot;to 
                the land of our<br>
                ancestors, the glorious land of monuments and fancy- to Europe!&quot;<br>
                The ship of the air comes. It is crowded with passengers, for<br>
                the transit is quicker than by sea. The electro-magnetic wire 
                under<br>
                the ocean has already telegraphed the number of the aerial caravan.<br>
                Europe is in sight. It is the coast of Ireland that they see, 
                but<br>
                the passengers are still asleep; they will not be called till 
                they are<br>
                exactly over England. There they will first step on European shore, 
                in<br>
                the land of Shakespeare, as the educated call it; in the land 
                of<br>
                politics, the land of machines, as it is called by others.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Here they stay a whole day. That is all the time the busy race 
                can<br>
                devote to the whole of England and Scotland. Then the journey 
                is<br>
                continued through the tunnel under the English Channel, to France, 
                the land of Charlemagne and Napoleon. Moliere is named, the learned 
                men talk of the classic school of remote antiquity. There is rejoicing 
                and shouting for the names of heroes, poets, and men of science, 
                whom our time does not know, but who will be born after our time 
                in<br>
                Paris, the centre of Europe, and elsewhere.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The air steamboat flies over the country whence Columbus went<br>
                forth, where Cortez was born, and where Calderon sang dramas in<br>
                sounding verse. Beautiful black-eyed women live still in the<br>
                blooming valleys, and the oldest songs speak of the Cid and the<br>
                Alhambra.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then through the air, over the sea, to Italy, where once lay<br>
                old, everlasting Rome. It has vanished! The Campagna lies desert. 
                A<br>
                single ruined wall is shown as the remains of St. Peter's, but 
                there<br>
                is a doubt if this ruin be genuine.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Next to Greece, to sleep a night in the grand hotel at the top<br>
                of Mount Olympus, to say that they have been there; and the journey 
                is continued to the Bosphorus, to rest there a few hours, and 
                see the<br>
                place where Byzantium lay; and where the legend tells that the 
                harem<br>
                stood in the time of the Turks, poor fishermen are now spreading 
                their nets.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Over the remains of mighty cities on the broad Danube, cities<br>
                which we in our time know not, the travellers pass; but here and<br>
                there, on the rich sites of those that time shall bring forth, 
                the<br>
                caravan sometimes descends, and departs thence again.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Down below lies Germany, that was once covered with a close net 
                of<br>
                railway and canals, the region where Luther spoke, where Goethe<br>
                sang, and Mozart once held the sceptre of harmony. Great names 
                shine there, in science and in art, names that are unknown to 
                us. One day devoted to seeing Germany, and one for the North, 
                the country of Oersted and Linnaeus, and for Norway, the land 
                of the old heroes and the young Normans. Iceland is visited on 
                the journey home. The geysers burn no more, Hecla is an extinct 
                volcano, but the rocky island is still fixed in the midst of the 
                foaming sea, a continual monument of legend and poetry.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There is really a great deal to be seen in Europe,&quot; 
                says the<br>
                young American, &quot;and we have seen it in a week, according 
                to the<br>
                directions of the great traveller&quot; (and here he mentions 
                the name of<br>
                one of his contemporaries) &quot;in his celebrated work, 'How 
                to See All<br>
                Europe in a Week.'&quot;</p>

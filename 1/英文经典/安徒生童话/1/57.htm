              <p class="h" align="center"> THE GOBLIN AND THE HUCKSTER</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THERE was once a regular student, who lived in a garret, and 
                had<br>
                no possessions. And there was also a regular huckster, to whom 
                the<br>
                house belonged, and who occupied the ground floor. A goblin lived 
                with the huckster, because at Christmas he always had a large 
                dish full<br>
                of jam, with a great piece of butter in the middle. The huckster 
                could<br>
                afford this; and therefore the goblin remained with the huckster,<br>
                which was very cunning of him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One evening the student came into the shop through the back door<br>
                to buy candles and cheese for himself, he had no one to send, 
                and<br>
                therefore he came himself; he obtained what he wished, and then 
                the<br>
                huckster and his wife nodded good evening to him, and she was 
                a<br>
                woman who could do more than merely nod, for she had usually plenty 
                to say for herself. The student nodded in return as he turned 
                to leave, then suddenly stopped, and began reading the piece of 
                paper in which the cheese was wrapped. It was a leaf torn out 
                of an old book, a book that ought not to have been torn up, for 
                it was full of poetry.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yonder lies some more of the same sort,&quot; said the 
                huckster: &quot;I<br>
                gave an old woman a few coffee berries for it; you shall have 
                the rest<br>
                for sixpence, if you will.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Indeed I will,&quot; said the student; &quot;give me the 
                book instead of<br>
                the cheese; I can eat my bread and butter without cheese. It would<br>
                be a sin to tear up a book like this. You are a clever man; and 
                a<br>
                practical man; but you understand no more about poetry than that<br>
                cask yonder.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>This was a very rude speech, especially against the cask; but<br>
                the huckster and the student both laughed, for it was only said 
                in<br>
                fun. But the goblin felt very angry that any man should venture 
                to say<br>
                such things to a huckster who was a householder and sold the best<br>
                butter. As soon as it was night, and the shop closed, and every 
                one in<br>
                bed except the student, the goblin stepped softly into the bedroom<br>
                where the huckster's wife slept, and took away her tongue, which 
                of<br>
                course, she did not then want. Whatever object in the room he 
                placed<br>
                his tongue upon immediately received voice and speech, and was 
                able to express its thoughts and feelings as readily as the lady 
                herself could do. It could only be used by one object at a time, 
                which was a good thing, as a number speaking at once would have 
                caused great confusion.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The goblin laid the tongue upon the cask, in which lay a quantity 
                of<br>
                old newspapers.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Is it really true,&quot; he asked, that you do not know 
                what poetry<br>
                is?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Of course I know,&quot; replied the cask: &quot;poetry 
                is something that<br>
                always stand in the corner of a newspaper, and is sometimes cut 
                out;<br>
                and I may venture to affirm that I have more of it in me than 
                the<br>
                student has, and I am only a poor tub of the huckster's.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the goblin placed the tongue on the coffee mill; and how 
                it<br>
                did go to be sure! Then he put it on the butter tub and the cash<br>
                box, and they all expressed the same opinion as the waste-paper 
                tub;<br>
                and a majority must always be respected.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now I shall go and tell the student,&quot; said the goblin; 
                and with<br>
                these words he went quietly up the back stairs to the garret where 
                the<br>
                student lived. He had a candle burning still, and the goblin peeped<br>
                through the keyhole and saw that he was reading in the torn book,<br>
                which he had brought out of the shop. But how light the room was! 
                From the book shot forth a ray of light which grew broad and full, 
                like the stem of a tree, from which bright rays spread upward 
                and over the student's head. Each leaf was fresh, and each flower 
                was like a beautiful female head; some with dark and sparkling 
                eyes, and others with eyes that were wonderfully blue and clear. 
                The fruit gleamed like stars, and the room was filled with sounds 
                of beautiful music. The little goblin had never imagined, much 
                less seen or heard of, any sight so glorious as this. He stood 
                still on tiptoe, peeping in,<br>
                till the light went out in the garret. The student no doubt had<br>
                blown out his candle and gone to bed; but the little goblin remained<br>
                standing there nevertheless, and listening to the music which 
                still<br>
                sounded on, soft and beautiful, a sweet cradle-song for the student,<br>
                who had lain down to rest.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This is a wonderful place,&quot; said the goblin; &quot;I 
                never expected<br>
                such a thing. I should like to stay here with the student;&quot; 
                and the<br>
                little man thought it over, for he was a sensible little spirit. 
                At<br>
                last he sighed, &quot;but the student has no jam!&quot; So he 
                went down stairs<br>
                again into the huckster's shop, and it was a good thing he got 
                back<br>
                when he did, for the cask had almost worn out the lady's tongue; 
                he<br>
                had given a description of all that he contained on one side, 
                and<br>
                was just about to turn himself over to the other side to describe 
                what<br>
                was there, when the goblin entered and restored the tongue to 
                the<br>
                lady. But from that time forward, the whole shop, from the cash 
                box<br>
                down to the pinewood logs, formed their opinions from that of 
                the<br>
                cask; and they all had such confidence in him, and treated him 
                with so<br>
                much respect, that when the huckster read the criticisms on<br>
                theatricals and art of an evening, they fancied it must all come<br>
                from the cask.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But after what he had seen, the goblin could no longer sit and<br>
                listen quietly to the wisdom and understanding down stairs; so, 
                as<br>
                soon as the evening light glimmered in the garret, he took courage,<br>
                for it seemed to him as if the rays of light were strong cables,<br>
                drawing him up, and obliging him to go and peep through the keyhole; 
                and, while there, a feeling of vastness came over him such as 
                we experience by the ever-moving sea, when the storm breaks forth; 
                and it brought tears into his eyes. He did not himself know why 
                he wept, yet a kind of pleasant feeling mingled with his tears. 
                &quot;How<br>
                wonderfully glorious it would be to sit with the student under 
                such<br>
                a tree;&quot; but that was out of the question, he must be content 
                to<br>
                look through the keyhole, and be thankful for even that.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There he stood on the old landing, with the autumn wind blowing<br>
                down upon him through the trap-door. It was very cold; but the<br>
                little creature did not really feel it, till the light in the 
                garret<br>
                went out, and the tones of music died away. Then how he shivered,<br>
                and crept down stairs again to his warm corner, where it felt<br>
                home-like and comfortable. And when Christmas came again, and<br>
                brought the dish of jam and the great lump of butter, he liked 
                the<br>
                huckster best of all.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Soon after, in the middle of the night, the goblin was awoke 
                by<br>
                a terrible noise and knocking against the window shutters and 
                the<br>
                house doors, and by the sound of the watchman's horn; for a great 
                fire had broken out, and the whole street appeared full of flames. 
                Was it in their house, or a neighbor's? No one could tell, for 
                terror had<br>
                seized upon all. The huckster's wife was so bewildered that she 
                took<br>
                her gold ear-rings out of her ears and put them in her pocket, 
                that<br>
                she might save something at least. The huckster ran to get his<br>
                business papers, and the servant resolved to save her blue silk<br>
                mantle, which she had managed to buy. Each wished to keep the 
                best<br>
                things they had. The goblin had the same wish; for, with one spring,<br>
                he was up stairs and in the student's room, whom he found standing<br>
                by the open window, and looking quite calmly at the fire, which 
                was<br>
                raging at the house of a neighbor opposite. The goblin caught 
                up the<br>
                wonderful book which lay on the table, and popped it into his 
                red cap, which he held tightly with both hands. The greatest treasure 
                in the house was saved; and he ran away with it to the roof, and 
                seated<br>
                himself on the chimney. The flames of the burning house opposite<br>
                illuminated him as he sat, both hands pressed tightly over his 
                cap, in<br>
                which the treasure lay; and then he found out what feelings really<br>
                reigned in his heart, and knew exactly which way they tended. 
                And yet, when the fire was extinguished, and the goblin again 
                began to reflect, he hesitated, and said at last, &quot;I must 
                divide myself between the two; I cannot quite give up the huckster, 
                because of the jam.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And this is a representation of human nature. We are like the<br>
                goblin; we all go to visit the huckster &quot;because of the jam.&quot;</p>

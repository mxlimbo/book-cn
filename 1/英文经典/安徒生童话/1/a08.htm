              <p class="h" align="center"> THE SWINEHERD</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> ONCE upon a time lived a poor prince; his kingdom was very<br>
                small, but it was large enough to enable him to marry, and marry 
                he<br>
                would. It was rather bold of him that he went and asked the<br>
                emperor's daughter: &quot;Will you marry me?&quot; but he ventured 
                to do so, for his name was known far and wide, and there were 
                hundreds of princesses who would have gladly accepted him, but 
                would she do so? Now we shall see.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On the grave of the prince's father grew a rose-tree, the most<br>
                beautiful of its kind. It bloomed only once in five years, and 
                then it<br>
                had only one single rose upon it, but what a rose! It had such 
                a sweet<br>
                scent that one instantly forgot all sorrow and grief when one 
                smelt<br>
                it. He had also a nightingale, which could sing as if every sweet<br>
                melody was in its throat. This rose and the nightingale he wished 
                to<br>
                give to the princess; and therefore both were put into big silver<br>
                cases and sent to her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The emperor ordered them to be carried into the great hall where<br>
                the princess was just playing &quot;Visitors are coming&quot; 
                with her<br>
                ladies-in-waiting; when she saw the large cases with the presents<br>
                therein, she clapped her hands for joy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I wish it were a little pussy cat,&quot; she said. But 
                then the<br>
                rose-tree with the beautiful rose was unpacked.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, how nicely it is made,&quot; exclaimed the ladies.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is more than nice,&quot; said the emperor, &quot;it 
                is charming.&quot;<br>
                The princess touched it and nearly began to cry.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;For shame, pa,&quot; she said, &quot;it is not artificial, 
                it is natural!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;For shame, it is natural&quot; repeated all her ladies.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Let us first see what the other case contains before we 
                are<br>
                angry,&quot; said the emperor; then the nightingale was taken 
                out, and it<br>
                sang so beautifully that no one could possibly say anything unkind<br>
                about it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Superbe, charmant,&quot; said the ladies of the court, 
                for they all<br>
                prattled French, one worse than the other.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How much the bird reminds me of the musical box of the 
                late<br>
                lamented empress,&quot; said an old courtier, &quot;it has exactly 
                the same<br>
                tone, the same execution.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are right,&quot; said the emperor, and began to cry 
                like a<br>
                little child.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I hope it is not natural,&quot; said the princess.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, certainly it is natural,&quot; replied those who had 
                brought<br>
                the presents.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Then let it fly,&quot; said the princess, and refused to 
                see the<br>
                prince.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the prince was not discouraged. He painted his face, put 
                on<br>
                common clothes, pulled his cap over his forehead, and came back.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Good day, emperor,&quot; he said, &quot;could you not give 
                me some<br>
                employment at the court?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There are so many,&quot; replied the emperor, &quot;who 
                apply for places,<br>
                that for the present I have no vacancy, but I will remember you. 
                But<br>
                wait a moment; it just comes into my mind, I require somebody 
                to<br>
                look after my pigs, for I have a great many.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Thus the prince was appointed imperial swineherd, and as such 
                he<br>
                lived in a wretchedly small room near the pigsty; there he worked<br>
                all day long, and when it was night he had made a pretty little 
                pot.<br>
                There were little bells round the rim, and when the water began 
                to<br>
                boil in it, the bells began to play the old tune:</p>
              <p> &quot;A jolly old sow once lived in a sty,<br>
                Three little piggies had she,&quot; &amp;c.</p>
              <p>But what was more wonderful was that, when one put a finger into 
                the<br>
                steam rising from the pot, one could at once smell what meals 
                they<br>
                were preparing on every fire in the whole town. That was indeed 
                much more remarkable than the rose. When the princess with her 
                ladies passed by and heard the tune, she stopped and looked quite 
                pleased, for she also could play it- in fact, it was the only 
                tune she could play, and she played it with one finger.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is the tune I know,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;He 
                must be a<br>
                well-educated swineherd. Go and ask him how much the instrument 
                is.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>One of the ladies had to go and ask; but she put on pattens.<br>
                &quot;What will you take for your pot?&quot; asked the lady.<br>
                &quot;I will have ten kisses from the princess,&quot; said the 
                swineherd.<br>
                &quot;God forbid,&quot; said the lady.<br>
                &quot;Well, I cannot sell it for less,&quot; replied the swineherd.<br>
                &quot;What did he say?&quot; said the princess.<br>
                I really cannot tell you,&quot; replied the lady.<br>
                &quot;You can whisper it into my ear.&quot;<br>
                &quot;It is very naughty,&quot; said the princess, and walked 
                off.<br>
                But when she had gone a little distance, the bells rang again 
                so<br>
                sweetly:</p>
              <p> &quot;A jolly old sow once lived in a sty,<br>
                Three little piggies had she,&quot; &amp;c.</p>
              <p> &quot;Ask him,&quot; said the princess, &quot;if he will be 
                satisfied with ten<br>
                kisses from one of my ladies.&quot;<br>
                &quot;No, thank you,&quot; said the swineherd: &quot;ten kisses 
                from the<br>
                princess, or I keep my pot.&quot;<br>
                &quot;That is tiresome,&quot; said the princess. &quot;But you 
                must stand<br>
                before me, so that nobody can see it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The ladies placed themselves in front of her and spread out<br>
                their dresses, and she gave the swineherd ten kisses and received<br>
                the pot.<br>
              </p>
              <p>That was a pleasure! Day and night the water in the pot was<br>
                boiling; there was not a single fire in the whole town of which 
                they<br>
                did not know what was preparing on it, the chamberlain's as well 
                as<br>
                the shoemaker's. The ladies danced and clapped their hands for 
                joy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We know who will eat soup and pancakes; we know who will 
                eat<br>
                porridge and cutlets; oh, how interesting!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Very interesting, indeed,&quot; said the mistress of the 
                household.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But you must not betray me, for I am the emperor's daughter.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Of course not,&quot; they all said.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The swineherd- that is to say, the prince- but they did not know<br>
                otherwise than that he was a real swineherd- did not waste a single<br>
                day without doing something; he made a rattle, which, when turned<br>
                quickly round, played all the waltzes, galops, and polkas known<br>
                since the creation of the world.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But that is superbe,&quot; said the princess passing by. 
                &quot;I have never<br>
                heard a more beautiful composition. Go down and ask him what the<br>
                instrument costs; but I shall not kiss him again.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He will have a hundred kisses from the princess,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                lady, who had gone down to ask him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I believe he is mad,&quot; said the princess, and walked 
                off, but soon<br>
                she stopped. &quot;One must encourage art,&quot; she said. &quot;I 
                am the emperor's daughter! Tell him I will give him ten kisses, 
                as I did the other day; the remainder one of my ladies can give 
                him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But we do not like to kiss him&quot; said the ladies.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is nonsense,&quot; said the princess; &quot;if I can 
                kiss him, you can<br>
                also do it. Remember that I give you food and employment.&quot; 
                And the<br>
                lady had to go down once more.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;A hundred kisses from the princess,&quot; said the swineherd, 
                &quot;or<br>
                everybody keeps his own.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Place yourselves before me,&quot; said the princess then. 
                They did<br>
                as they were bidden, and the princess kissed him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I wonder what that crowd near the pigsty means!&quot; said 
                the<br>
                emperor, who had just come out on his balcony. He rubbed his eyes<br>
                and put his spectacles on.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The ladies of the court are up to some mischief, I think. 
                I shall<br>
                have to go down and see.&quot; He pulled up his shoes, for they 
                were down at the heels, and he was very quick about it. When he 
                had come down into the courtyard he walked quite softly, and the 
                ladies were so<br>
                busily engaged in counting the kisses, that all should be fair, 
                that<br>
                they did not notice the emperor. He raised himself on tiptoe.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What does this mean?&quot; he said, when he saw that his 
                daughter<br>
                was kissing the swineherd, and then hit their heads with his shoe 
                just<br>
                as the swineherd received the sixty-eighth kiss.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Go out of my sight,&quot; said the emperor, for he was 
                very angry; and<br>
                both the princess and the swineherd were banished from the empire.<br>
                There she stood and cried, the swineherd scolded her, and the 
                rain<br>
                came down in torrents.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Alas, unfortunate creature that I am!&quot; said the princess, 
                &quot;I wish<br>
                I had accepted the prince. Oh, how wretched I am!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The swineherd went behind a tree, wiped his face, threw off his<br>
                poor attire and stepped forth in his princely garments; he looked 
                so<br>
                beautiful that the princess could not help bowing to him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I have now learnt to despise you,&quot; he said. &quot;You 
                refused an<br>
                honest prince; you did not appreciate the rose and the nightingale;<br>

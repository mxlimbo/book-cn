              <p class="h" align="center"> IN THE NURSERY</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> FATHER, and mother, and brothers, and sisters, were gone to 
                the<br>
                play; only little Anna and her grandpapa were left at home.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We'll have a play too,&quot; he said, &quot;and it may 
                begin immediately.&quot;<br>
                &quot;But we have no theatre,&quot; cried little Anna, &quot;and 
                we have no one<br>
                to act for us; my old doll cannot, for she is a fright, and my 
                new one<br>
                cannot, for she must not rumple her new clothes.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;One can always get actors if one makes use of what one 
                has,&quot;<br>
                observed grandpapa.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now we'll go into the theatre. Here we will put up a book,<br>
                there another, and there a third, in a sloping row. Now three 
                on the<br>
                other side; so, now we have the side scenes. The old box that 
                lies<br>
                yonder may be the back stairs; and we'll lay the flooring on top 
                of<br>
                it. The stage represents a room, as every one may see. Now we 
                want the actors. Let us see what we can find in the plaything-box. 
                First the<br>
                personages, and then we will get the play ready. One after the<br>
                other; that will be capital! Here's a pipe-head, and yonder an 
                odd<br>
                glove; they will do very well for father and daughter.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But those are only two characters,&quot; said little Anna. 
                &quot;Here's<br>
                my brother's old waistcoat- could not that play in our piece, 
                too?&quot;<br>
                &quot;It's big enough, certainly,&quot; replied grandpapa. &quot;It 
                shall be<br>
                the lover. There's nothing in the pockets, and that's very<br>
                interesting, for that's half of an unfortunate attachment. And 
                here we<br>
                have the nut-cracker's boots, with spurs to them. Row, dow, dow! 
                how they can stamp and strut! They shall represent the unwelcome 
                wooer, whom the lady does not like. What kind of a play will you 
                have now?Shall it be a tragedy, or a domestic drama?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;A domestic drama, please,&quot; said little Anna, &quot;for 
                the others<br>
                are so fond of that. Do you know one?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I know a hundred,&quot; said grandpapa. &quot;Those that 
                are most in<br>
                favor are from the French, but they are not good for little girls.<br>
                In the meantime, we may take one of the prettiest, for inside<br>
                they're all very much alike. Now I shake the pen! Cock-a-lorum! 
                So<br>
                now, here's the play, brin-bran-span new! Now listen to the<br>
                play-bill.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And grandpapa took a newspaper, and read as if he were reading<br>
                from it:</p>
              <p> THE PIPE-HEAD AND THE GOOD HEAD<br>
                A Family Drama in One Act<br>
                CHARACTERS</p>
              <p> MR. PIPE-HEAD, a father. MR. WAISTCOAT, a lover.<br>
                MISS GLOVE, a daughter. MR. DE BOOTS, a suitor.</p>
              <p> &quot;And now we're going to begin. The curtain rises. We have 
                no<br>
                curtain, so it has risen already. All the characters are there, 
                and so<br>
                we have them at hand. Now I speak as Papa Pipe-head! He's angry<br>
                to-day. One can see that he's a colored meerschaum.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Snik, snak, snurre, bassellurre! I'm master of this house! 
                I'm<br>
                the father of my daughter! Will you hear what I have to say? Mr. 
                de<br>
                Boots is a person in whom one may see one's face; his upper part 
                is of morocco, and he has spurs into the bargain. Snikke, snakke, 
                snak! He shall have my daughter!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now listen to what the Waistcoat says, little Anna,&quot; 
                said<br>
                grandpapa. &quot;Now the Waistcoat's speaking. The Waistcoat has 
                a<br>
                laydown collar, and is very modest; but he knows his own value, 
                and<br>
                has quite a right to say what he says:<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'I haven't a spot on me! Goodness of material ought to 
                be<br>
                appreciated. I am of real silk, and have strings to me.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'- On the wedding day, but no longer; you don't keep your 
                color<br>
                in the wash.' This is Mr. Pipe-head who is speaking. 'Mr. de Boots<br>
                is water-tight, of strong leather, and yet very delicate; he can<br>
                creak, and clank with his spurs, and has an Italian physiognomy-'&quot;<br>
                &quot;But they ought to speak in verses,&quot; said Anna, &quot;for 
                I've heard<br>
                that's the most charming way of all.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;They can do that too,&quot; replied grandpapa; &quot;and 
                if the public<br>
                demands it, they will talk in that way. Just look at little Miss<br>
                Glove, how she's pointing her fingers!</p>
              <p> &quot;'Could I but have my love,<br>
                Who then so happy as Glove!<br>
                Ah!<br>
                If I from him must part,<br>
                I'm sure 'twill break my heart!'<br>
                'Bah!'</p>
              <p>The last word was spoken by Mr. Pipe-head; and now it's Mr.<br>
                Waistcoat's turn:</p>
              <p> &quot;'O Glove, my own dear,<br>
                Though it cost thee a tear,<br>
                Thou must be mine,<br>
                For Holger Danske has sworn it!'</p>
              <p> &quot;Mr. de Boots, hearing this, kicks up, jingles his spurs, 
                and<br>
                knocks down three of the side-scenes.&quot;<br>
                &quot;That's exceedingly charming!&quot; cried little Anna.<br>
                &quot;Silence! silence!&quot; said grandpapa. &quot;Silent approbation 
                will<br>
                show that you are the educated public in the stalls. Now Miss 
                Glove<br>
                sings her great song with startling effects:</p>
              <p> &quot;'I can't see, heigho!<br>
                And therefore I'll crow!<br>
                Kikkeriki, in the lofty hall!'</p>
              <p> &quot;Now comes the exciting part, little Anna. This is the 
                most<br>
                important in all the play. Mr. Waistcoat undoes himself, and addresses 
                his speech to you, that you may applaud; but leave it alone,- 
                that's considered more genteel.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'I am driven to extremities! Take care of yourself! Now 
                comes the<br>
                plot! You are the Pipe-head, and I am the good head- snap! there 
                you<br>
                go!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Do you notice this, little Anna?&quot; asked grandpapa. 
                &quot;That's a most<br>
                charming comedy. Mr. Waistcoat seized the old Pipe-head and put 
                him in his pocket; there he lies, and the Waistcoat says:<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'You are in my pocket; you can't come out till you promise 
                to<br>
                unite me to your daughter Glove on the left. I hold out my right<br>
                hand.'&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That's awfully pretty,&quot; said little Anna.<br>
                &quot;And now the old Pipe-head replies:</p>
              <p> &quot;'Though I'm all ear,<br>
                Very stupid I appear:<br>
                Where's my humor? Gone, I fear,<br>
                And I feel my hollow stick's not here,<br>
                Ah! never, my dear,<br>
                Did I feel so queer.<br>
                Oh! pray let me out,<br>
                And like a lamb led to slaughter<br>
                I'll betroth you, no doubt,<br>
                To my daughter.'&quot;</p>
              <p> &quot;Is the play over already?&quot; asked little Anna.<br>
                &quot;By no means,&quot; replied grandpapa. &quot;It's only all 
                over with Mr.<br>
                de Boots. Now the lovers kneel down, and one of them sings:</p>
              <p> &quot;'Father!'</p>
              <p>and the other,</p>
              <p> 'Come, do as you ought to do,-<br>
                Bless your son and daughter.'</p>
              <p>And they receive his blessing, and celebrate their wedding, and 
                all<br>
                the pieces of furniture sing in chorus,</p>
              <p> &quot;'Klink! clanks!<br>
                A thousand thanks;<br>
                And now the play is over!'</p>
              <p> &quot;And now we'll applaud,&quot; said grandpapa. &quot;We'll 
                call them all out,<br>
                and the pieces of furniture too, for they are of mahogany.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And is not our play just as good as those which the others 
                have<br>
                in the real theatre?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Our play is much better,&quot; said grandpapa. &quot;It 
                is shorter, the<br>
                performers are natural, and it has passed away the interval before<br>
                tea-time.&quot;</p>

              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> I WILL tell you a story that was told me when I was a little<br>
                boy. Every time I thought of this story, it seemed to me more 
                and more charming; for it is with stories as it is with many people- 
                they<br>
                become better as they grow older.<br>
              </p>
              <p>I have no doubt that you have been in the country, and seen a 
                very<br>
                old farmhouse, with a thatched roof, and mosses and small plants<br>
                growing wild upon it. There is a stork's nest on the ridge of 
                the<br>
                gable, for we cannot do without the stork. The walls of the house<br>
                are sloping, and the windows are low, and only one of the latter 
                is<br>
                made to open. The baking-oven sticks out of the wall like a great<br>
                knob. An elder-tree hangs over the palings; and beneath its<br>
                branches, at the foot of the paling, is a pool of water, in which 
                a<br>
                few ducks are disporting themselves. There is a yard-dog too, 
                who<br>
                barks at all corners. Just such a farmhouse as this stood in a 
                country<br>
                lane; and in it dwelt an old couple, a peasant and his wife. Small<br>
                as their possessions were, they had one article they could not 
                do<br>
                without, and that was a horse, which contrived to live upon the<br>
                grass which it found by the side of the high road. The old peasant<br>
                rode into the town upon this horse, and his neighbors often borrowed<br>
                it of him, and paid for the loan of it by rendering some service 
                to<br>
                the old couple. After a time they thought it would be as well 
                to<br>
                sell the horse, or exchange it for something which might be more<br>
                useful to them. But what might this something be?<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You'll know best, old man,&quot; said the wife. &quot;It 
                is fair-day<br>
                to-day; so ride into town, and get rid of the horse for money, 
                or make<br>
                a good exchange; whichever you do will be right to me, so ride 
                to the<br>
                fair.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And she fastened his neckerchief for him; for she could do that<br>
                better than he could, and she could also tie it very prettily 
                in a<br>
                double bow. She also smoothed his hat round and round with the 
                palm of her hand, and gave him a kiss. Then he rode away upon 
                the horse that was to be sold or bartered for something else. 
                Yes, the old man knew what he was about. The sun shone with great 
                heat, and not a cloud was to be seen in the sky. The road was 
                very dusty; for a number of people, all going to the fair, were 
                driving, riding, or walking upon it. There was no shelter anywhere 
                from the hot sunshine. </p>
              <p>Among the rest a man came trudging along, and driving a cow to 
                the fair. The cow was as beautiful a creature as any cow could 
                be.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;She gives good milk, I am certain,&quot; said the peasant 
                to<br>
                himself. &quot;That would be a very good exchange: the cow for 
                the horse.<br>
                Hallo there! you with the cow,&quot; he said. &quot;I tell you 
                what; I dare<br>
                say a horse is of more value than a cow; but I don't care for 
                that,- a<br>
                cow will be more useful to me; so, if you like, we'll exchange.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;To be sure I will,&quot; said the man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Accordingly the exchange was made; and as the matter was<br>
                settled, the peasant might have turned back; for he had done the<br>
                business he came to do. But, having made up his mind to go to 
                the<br>
                fair, he determined to do so, if only to have a look at it; so 
                on he<br>
                went to the town with his cow. Leading the animal, he strode on<br>
                sturdily, and, after a short time, overtook a man who was driving 
                a<br>
                sheep. It was a good fat sheep, with a fine fleece on its back.<br>
                &quot;I should like to have that fellow,&quot; said the peasant 
                to<br>
                himself. &quot;There is plenty of grass for him by our palings, 
                and in<br>
                the winter we could keep him in the room with us. Perhaps it would<br>
                be more profitable to have a sheep than a cow. Shall I exchange?&quot;<br>
                The man with the sheep was quite ready, and the bargain was<br>
                quickly made. And then our peasant continued his way on the<br>
                high-road with his sheep. Soon after this, he overtook another 
                man,<br>
                who had come into the road from a field, and was carrying a large<br>
                goose under his arm.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What a heavy creature you have there!&quot; said the peasant; 
                &quot;it<br>
                has plenty of feathers and plenty of fat, and would look well 
                tied<br>
                to a string, or paddling in the water at our place. That would 
                be very<br>
                useful to my old woman; she could make all sorts of profits out 
                of it.<br>
                How often she has said, 'If now we only had a goose!' Now here 
                is an opportunity, and, if possible, I will get it for her. Shall 
                we<br>
                exchange? I will give you my sheep for your goose, and thanks 
                into the bargain.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The other had not the least objection, and accordingly the<br>
                exchange was made, and our peasant became possessor of the goose. 
                By this time he had arrived very near the town. The crowd on the 
                high road had been gradually increasing, and there was quite a 
                rush of men and cattle. The cattle walked on the path and by the 
                palings, and at the turnpike-gate they even walked into the toll-keeper's 
                potato-field, where one fowl was strutting about with a string 
                tied to its leg, for fear it should take fright at the crowd, 
                and run away and get lost. The tail-feathers of the fowl were 
                very short, and it winked with both its eyes, and looked very 
                cunning, as it said &quot;Cluck,<br>
                cluck.&quot; What were the thoughts of the fowl as it said this 
                I cannot<br>
                tell you; but directly our good man saw it, he thought, &quot;Why 
                that's<br>
                the finest fowl I ever saw in my life; it's finer than our parson's<br>
                brood hen, upon my word. I should like to have that fowl. Fowls 
                can<br>
                always pick up a few grains that lie about, and almost keep<br>
                themselves. I think it would be a good exchange if I could get 
                it<br>
                for my goose. Shall we exchange?&quot; he asked the toll-keeper.<br>
                &quot;Exchange,&quot; repeated the man; &quot;well, it would not 
                be a bad thing.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And so they made an exchange,- the toll-keeper at the<br>
                turnpike-gate kept the goose, and the peasant carried off the 
                fowl.<br>
                Now he had really done a great deal of business on his way to 
                the<br>
                fair, and he was hot and tired. He wanted something to eat, and 
                a<br>
                glass of ale to refresh himself; so he turned his steps to an 
                inn.<br>
                He was just about to enter when the ostler came out, and they 
                met at<br>
                the door. The ostler was carrying a sack. &quot;What have you 
                in that<br>
                sack?&quot; asked the peasant.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Rotten apples,&quot; answered the ostler; &quot;a whole 
                sackful of them.<br>
                They will do to feed the pigs with.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why that will be terrible waste,&quot; he replied; &quot;I 
                should like to<br>
                take them home to my old woman. Last year the old apple-tree by 
                the<br>
                grass-plot only bore one apple, and we kept it in the cupboard 
                till it<br>
                was quite withered and rotten. It was always property, my old 
                woman<br>
                said; and here she would see a great deal of property- a whole<br>
                sackful; I should like to show them to her.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What will you give me for the sackful?&quot; asked the 
                ostler.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What will I give? Well, I will give you my fowl in exchange.&quot;<br>
                So he gave up the fowl, and received the apples, which he<br>
                carried into the inn parlor. He leaned the sack carefully against<br>
                the stove, and then went to the table. But the stove was hot, 
                and he<br>
                had not thought of that. Many guests were present- horse dealers,<br>
                cattle drovers, and two Englishmen. The Englishmen were so rich 
                that<br>
                their pockets quite bulged out and seemed ready to burst; and 
                they<br>
                could bet too, as you shall hear. &quot;Hiss-s-s, hiss-s-s.&quot; 
                What could<br>
                that be by the stove? The apples were beginning to roast. &quot;What 
                is<br>
                that?&quot; asked one.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why, do you know&quot;- said our peasant. And then he told 
                them the<br>
                whole story of the horse, which he had exchanged for a cow, and 
                all<br>
                the rest of it, down to the apples.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, your old woman will give it you well when you get 
                home,&quot;<br>
                said one of the Englishmen. &quot;Won't there be a noise?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What! Give me what?&quot; said the peasant. &quot;Why, 
                she will kiss me,<br>
                and say, 'what the old man does is always right.'&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Let us lay a wager on it,&quot; said the Englishmen. &quot;We'll 
                wager<br>
                you a ton of coined gold, a hundred pounds to the hundred-weight.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No; a bushel will be enough,&quot; replied the peasant. 
                &quot;I can only<br>
                set a bushel of apples against it, and I'll throw myself and my 
                old<br>
                woman into the bargain; that will pile up the measure, I fancy.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Done! taken!&quot; and so the bet was made.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the landlord's coach came to the door, and the two Englishmen<br>
                and the peasant got in, and away they drove, and soon arrived 
                and<br>
                stopped at the peasant's hut. &quot;Good evening, old woman.&quot; 
                &quot;Good<br>
                evening, old man.&quot; &quot;I've made the exchange.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah, well, you understand what you're about,&quot; said 
                the woman. Then<br>
                she embraced him, and paid no attention to the strangers, nor 
                did<br>
                she notice the sack.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I got a cow in exchange for the horse.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thank Heaven,&quot; said she. &quot;Now we shall have plenty 
                of milk, and<br>
                butter, and cheese on the table. That was a capital exchange.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, but I changed the cow for a sheep.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah, better still!&quot; cried the wife. &quot;You always 
                think of<br>
                everything; we have just enough pasture for a sheep. Ewe's milk 
                and<br>
                cheese, woollen jackets and stockings! The cow could not give 
                all<br>
                these, and her hair only falls off. How you think of everything!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But I changed away the sheep for a goose.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Then we shall have roast goose to eat this year. You dear 
                old<br>
                man, you are always thinking of something to please me. This is<br>
                delightful. We can let the goose walk about with a string tied 
                to<br>
                her leg, so she will be fatter still before we roast her.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But I gave away the goose for a fowl.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;A fowl! Well, that was a good exchange,&quot; replied the 
                woman.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The fowl will lay eggs and hatch them, and we shall have 
                chickens; we shall soon have a poultry-yard. Oh, this is just 
                what I was wishing<br>
                for.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, but I exchanged the fowl for a sack of shrivelled 
                apples.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What! I really must give you a kiss for that!&quot; exclaimed 
                the<br>
                wife. &quot;My dear, good husband, now I'll tell you something. 
                Do you<br>
                know, almost as soon as you left me this morning, I began to think<br>
                of what I could give you nice for supper this evening, and then 
                I<br>
                thought of fried eggs and bacon, with sweet herbs; I had eggs 
                and<br>
                bacon, but I wanted the herbs; so I went over to the schoolmaster's: 
                I<br>
                knew they had plenty of herbs, but the schoolmistress is very 
                mean,<br>
                although she can smile so sweetly. I begged her to lend me a handful<br>
                of herbs. 'Lend!' she exclaimed, 'I have nothing to lend; nothing 
                at<br>
                all grows in our garden, not even a shrivelled apple; I could 
                not even<br>
                lend you a shrivelled apple, my dear woman. But now I can lend 
                her<br>
                ten, or a whole sackful, which I'm very glad of; it makes me laugh<br>
                to think about it;&quot; and then she gave him a hearty kiss.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, I like all this,&quot; said both the Englishmen; 
                &quot;always going<br>
                down the hill, and yet always merry; it's worth the money to see<br>
                it.&quot; So they paid a hundred-weight of gold to the peasant, 
                who,<br>
                whatever he did, was not scolded but kissed.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Yes, it always pays best when the wife sees and maintains that 
                her<br>
                husband knows best, and whatever he does is right.<br>
              </p>
              <p>That is a story which I heard when I was a child; and now you 
                have<br>
                heard it too, and know that &quot;What the old man does is always 
                right.&quot;</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> THE MAIL-COACH PASSENGERS</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IT was bitterly cold, the sky glittered with stars, and not 
                a<br>
                breeze stirred. &quot;Bump&quot;- an old pot was thrown at a neighbor's 
                door;<br>
                and &quot;bang, bang,&quot; went the guns; for they were greeting 
                the New<br>
                Year. It was New Year's Eve, and the church clock was striking 
                twelve.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Tan-ta-ra-ra, tan-ta-ra-ra,&quot; sounded the horn, and 
                the mail-coach<br>
                came lumbering up. The clumsy vehicle stopped at the gate of the 
                town; all the places had been taken, for there were twelve passengers 
                in the coach.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Hurrah! hurrah!&quot; cried the people in the town; for 
                in every house<br>
                the New Year was being welcomed; and as the clock struck, they 
                stood up, the full glasses in their hands, to drink success to 
                the new<br>
                comer. &quot;A happy New Year,&quot; was the cry; &quot;a pretty 
                wife, plenty of<br>
                money, and no sorrow or care.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The wish passed round, and the glasses clashed together till<br>
                they rang again; while before the town-gate the mail coach stopped<br>
                with the twelve strange passengers. And who were these strangers? 
              </p>
              <p>Each of them had his passport and his luggage with him; they 
                even brought presents for me, and for you, and for all the people 
                in the town. &quot;Who were they? what did they want? and what 
                did they bring with them?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Good-morning,&quot; they cried to the sentry at the town-gate.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Good-morning,&quot; replied the sentry; for the clock had 
                struck<br>
                twelve. &quot;Your name and profession?&quot; asked the sentry 
                of the one who alighted first from the carriage.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;See for yourself in the passport,&quot; he replied. &quot;I 
                am myself;&quot; and<br>
                a famous fellow he looked, arrayed in bear-skin and fur boots. 
                &quot;I am<br>
                the man on whom many persons fix their hopes. Come to me to-morrow, 
                and I'll give you a New Year's present. I throw shillings and 
                pence among the people; I give balls, no less than thirty-one; 
                indeed,<br>
                that is the highest number I can spare for balls. My ships are 
                often<br>
                frozen in, but in my offices it is warm and comfortable. My name 
                is<br>
                JANUARY. I'm a merchant, and I generally bring my accounts with 
                me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the second alighted. He seemed a merry fellow. He was a<br>
                director of a theatre, a manager of masked balls, and a leader 
                of<br>
                all the amusements we can imagine. His luggage consisted of a 
                great<br>
                cask.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We'll dance the bung out of the cask at carnival time,&quot; 
                said<br>
                he; &quot;I'll prepare a merry tune for you and for myself too.<br>
                Unfortunately I have not long to live- the shortest time, in fact,<br>
                of my whole family- only twenty-eight days. Sometimes they pop 
                me in a day extra; but I trouble myself very little about that. 
                Hurrah!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You must not shout so,&quot; said the sentry.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Certainly I may shout,&quot; retorted the man; &quot;I'm 
                Prince Carnival,<br>
                travelling under the name of FEBRUARY.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The third now got out. He looked a personification of fasting; 
                but<br>
                he carried his nose very high, for he was related to the &quot;forty<br>
                (k)nights,&quot; and was a weather prophet. But that is not a 
                very<br>
                lucrative office, and therefore he praised fasting. In his button-hole<br>
                he carried a little bunch of violets, but they were very small.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;MARCH, March,&quot; the fourth called after him, slapping 
                him on the<br>
                shoulder, &quot;don't you smell something? Make haste into the 
                guard<br>
                room; they're drinking punch there; that's your favorite drink. 
                I<br>
                can smell it out here already. Forward, Master March.&quot; But 
                it was<br>
                not true; the speaker only wanted to remind him of his name, and 
                to<br>
                make an APRIL fool of him; for with that fun the fourth generally<br>
                began his career. He looked very jovial, did little work, and 
                had<br>
                the more holidays. &quot;If the world were only a little more 
                settled,&quot;<br>
                said he: &quot;but sometimes I'm obliged to be in a good humor, 
                and<br>
                sometimes a bad one, according to circumstances; now rain, now<br>
                sunshine. I'm kind of a house agent, also a manager of funerals. 
                I can<br>
                laugh or cry, according to circumstances. I have my summer wardrobe 
                in this box here, but it would be very foolish to put it on now. 
                Here I am. On Sundays I go out walking in shoes and white silk 
                stockings, and a muff.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>After him, a lady stepped out of the coach. She called herself<br>
                Miss MAY. She wore a summer dress and overshoes; her dress was 
                a light green, and she wore anemones in her hair. She was so scented 
                with wild-thyme, that it made the sentry sneeze.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Your health, and God bless you,&quot; was her salutation 
                to him.<br>
                How pretty she was! and such a singer! not a theatre singer, nor 
                a<br>
                ballad singer; no, but a singer of the woods; for she wandered 
                through the gay green forest, and had a concert there for her 
                own amusement.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now comes the young lady,&quot; said those in the carriage; 
                and out<br>
                stepped a young dame, delicate, proud, and pretty. It was Mistress<br>
                JUNE, in whose service people become lazy and fond of sleeping 
                for<br>
                hours. She gives a feast on the longest day of the year, that 
                there<br>
                may be time for her guests to partake of the numerous dishes at 
                her<br>
                table. Indeed, she keeps her own carriage; but still she travelled<br>
                by the mail, with the rest, because she wished to show that she 
                was<br>
                not high-minded. But she was not without a protector; her younger<br>
                brother, JULY, was with her. He was a plump young fellow, clad 
                in<br>
                summer garments and wearing a straw hat. He had but very little<br>
                luggage with him, because it was so cumbersome in the great heat; 
                he<br>
                had, however, swimming-trousers with him, which are nothing to<br>
                carry. Then came the mother herself, in crinoline, Madame AUGUST, 
                a wholesale dealer in fruit, proprietress of a large number of 
                fish<br>
                ponds and a land cultivator. She was fat and heated, yet she could 
                use her hands well, and would herself carry out beer to the laborers 
                in<br>
                the field. &quot;In the sweat of the face shalt thou eat bread,&quot; 
                said<br>
                she; &quot;it is written in the Bible.&quot; After work, came 
                the recreations,<br>
                dancing and playing in the greenwood, and the &quot;harvest homes.&quot; 
                She was a thorough housewife.<br>
              </p>
              <p>After her a man came out of the coach, who is a painter; he is 
                the<br>
                great master of colors, and is named SEPTEMBER. The forest, on 
                his arrival, had to change its colors when he wished it; and how 
                beautiful are the colors he chooses! The woods glow with hues 
                of red and gold and brown. This great master painter could whistle 
                like a blackbird.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He was quick in his work, and soon entwined the tendrils of the 
                hop<br>
                plant around his beer jug. This was an ornament to the jug, and 
                he has<br>
                a great love for ornament. There he stood with his color pot in 
                his<br>
                hand, and that was the whole of his luggage. A land-owner followed,<br>
                who in the month for sowing seed attended to the ploughing and 
                was<br>
                fond of field sports. Squire OCTOBER brought his dog and his gun<br>
                with him, and had nuts in his game bag. &quot;Crack, crack.&quot; 
                He had a great deal of luggage, even an English plough. He spoke 
                of farming, but what he said could scarcely be heard for the coughing 
                and gasping of his neighbor. It was NOVEMBER, who coughed violently 
                as he got out. He had a cold, which caused him to use his pocket-handkerchief 
                continually;and yet he said he was obliged to accompany servant 
                girls to their new places, and initiate them into their winter 
                service. He said he thought his cold would never leave him when 
                he went out woodcutting, for he was a master sawyer, and had to 
                supply wood to the whole parish. He spent his evenings preparing 
                wooden soles for skates, for he knew, he said, that in a few weeks 
                these shoes would be wanted for the amusement of skating. At length 
                the last passenger made her appearance,- old Mother </p>
              <p>DECEMBER, with her fire-stool. The dame was very old, but her 
                eyes glistened like two stars. She carried on her arm a flower-pot, 
                in which a little fir-tree was growing. &quot;This tree I shall 
                guard and cherish,&quot; she said, &quot;that it may grow large 
                by Christmas Eve, and reach from the ground to the ceiling, to 
                be covered and adorned with flaming candles, golden apples, and 
                little figures.</p>
              <p> The fire-stool will be as warm as a stove, and I shall then 
                bring a<br>
                story book out of my pocket, and read aloud till all the children 
                in<br>
                the room are quite quiet. Then the little figures on the tree 
                will<br>
                become lively, and the little waxen angel at the top spread out 
                his<br>
                wings of gold-leaf, and fly down from his green perch. He will 
                kiss<br>
                every one in the room, great and small; yes, even the poor children<br>
                who stand in the passage, or out in the street singing a carol 
                about<br>
                the 'Star of Bethlehem.'&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, now the coach may drive away,&quot; said the sentry; 
                &quot;we have<br>
                the whole twelve. Let the horses be put up.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;First, let all the twelve come to me,&quot; said the captain 
                on<br>
                duty, &quot;one after another. The passports I will keep here. 
                Each of them<br>
                is available for one month; when that has passed, I shall write 
                the<br>
                behavior of each on his passport. Mr. JANUARY, have the goodness 
                to come here.&quot; And Mr. January stepped forward.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When a year has passed, I think I shall be able to tell you what<br>
                the twelve passengers have brought to you, to me, and to all of 
                us.<br>
                Now I do not know, and probably even they don't know themselves, 
                for we live in strange times.</p>

                STORY THE FIRST</p>
              <p> WHICH describes a looking-glass and the broken fragments.<br>
                You must attend to the commencement of this story, for when we 
                get<br>
                to the end we shall know more than we do now about a very wicked<br>
                hobgoblin; he was one of the very worst, for he was a real demon.<br>
                One day, when he was in a merry mood, he made a looking-glass 
                which had the power of making everything good or beautiful that 
                was<br>
                reflected in it almost shrink to nothing, while everything that 
                was<br>
                worthless and bad looked increased in size and worse than ever. 
                The<br>
                most lovely landscapes appeared like boiled spinach, and the people<br>
                became hideous, and looked as if they stood on their heads and 
                had<br>
                no bodies. Their countenances were so distorted that no one could<br>
                recognize them, and even one freckle on the face appeared to spread<br>
                over the whole of the nose and mouth. The demon said this was 
                very<br>
                amusing. When a good or pious thought passed through the mind 
                of any one it was misrepresented in the glass; and then how the 
                demon laughed at his cunning invention. All who went to the demon's 
                school- for he kept a school- talked everywhere of the wonders 
                they had seen, and declared that people could now, for the first 
                time, see what the world and mankind were really like. They carried 
                the glass about everywhere, till at last there was not a land 
                nor a people who had not been looked at through this distorted 
                mirror. They wanted even to fly with it up to heaven to see the 
                angels, but the higher they flew the more slippery the glass became, 
                and they could scarcely hold it, till at<br>
                last it slipped from their hands, fell to the earth, and was broken<br>
                into millions of pieces. But now the looking-glass caused more<br>
                unhappiness than ever, for some of the fragments were not so large<br>
                as a grain of sand, and they flew about the world into every<br>
                country. When one of these tiny atoms flew into a person's eye, 
                it<br>
                stuck there unknown to him, and from that moment he saw everything<br>
                through a distorted medium, or could see only the worst side of 
                what<br>
                he looked at, for even the smallest fragment retained the same 
                power<br>
                which had belonged to the whole mirror. Some few persons even 
                got a fragment of the looking-glass in their hearts, and this 
                was very<br>
                terrible, for their hearts became cold like a lump of ice. A few 
                of<br>
                the pieces were so large that they could be used as window-panes; 
                it<br>
                would have been a sad thing to look at our friends through them. 
              </p>
              <p>Other pieces were made into spectacles; this was dreadful for 
                those who wore them, for they could see nothing either rightly 
                or justly. At all this the wicked demon laughed till his sides 
                shook- it tickled him so to see the mischief he had done. There 
                were still a number of these<br>
                little fragments of glass floating about in the air, and now you 
                shall<br>
                hear what happened with one of them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>SECOND STORY<br>
                A LITTLE BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL</p>
              <p> In a large town, full of houses and people, there is not room<br>
                for everybody to have even a little garden, therefore they are 
                obliged<br>
                to be satisfied with a few flowers in flower-pots. In one of these<br>
                large towns lived two poor children who had a garden something<br>
                larger and better than a few flower-pots. They were not brother 
                and<br>
                sister, but they loved each other almost as much as if they had<br>
                been. Their parents lived opposite to each other in two garrets, 
                where<br>
                the roofs of neighboring houses projected out towards each other 
                and<br>
                the water-pipe ran between them. In each house was a little window, 
                so that any one could step across the gutter from one window to 
                the<br>
                other. The parents of these children had each a large wooden box 
                in<br>
                which they cultivated kitchen herbs for their own use, and a little<br>
                rose-bush in each box, which grew splendidly. Now after a while 
                the<br>
                parents decided to place these two boxes across the water-pipe, 
                so<br>
                that they reached from one window to the other and looked like 
                two<br>
                banks of flowers. Sweet-peas drooped over the boxes, and the<br>
                rose-bushes shot forth long branches, which were trained round 
                the<br>
                windows and clustered together almost like a triumphal arch of<br>
                leaves and flowers. The boxes were very high, and the children 
                knew<br>
                they must not climb upon them, without permission, but they were<br>
                often, however, allowed to step out together and sit upon their 
                little<br>
                stools under the rose-bushes, or play quietly. In winter all this<br>
                pleasure came to an end, for the windows were sometimes quite 
                frozen over. But then they would warm copper pennies on the stove, 
                and hold the warm pennies against the frozen pane; there would 
                be very soon a little round hole through which they could peep, 
                and the soft bright eyes of the little boy and girl would beam 
                through the hole at each window as they looked at each other. 
                Their names were Kay and Gerda.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In summer they could be together with one jump from the window, 
                but in winter they had to go up and down the long staircase, and 
                out<br>
                through the snow before they could meet.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;See there are the white bees swarming,&quot; said Kay's 
                old<br>
                grandmother one day when it was snowing.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Have they a queen bee?&quot; asked the little boy, for 
                he knew that<br>
                the real bees had a queen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;To be sure they have,&quot; said the grandmother. &quot;She 
                is flying there<br>
                where the swarm is thickest. She is the largest of them all, and 
                never<br>
                remains on the earth, but flies up to the dark clouds. Often at<br>
                midnight she flies through the streets of the town, and looks 
                in at<br>
                the windows, then the ice freezes on the panes into wonderful<br>
                shapes, that look like flowers and castles.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, I have seen them,&quot; said both the children, and 
                they knew<br>
                it must be true.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Can the Snow Queen come in here?&quot; asked the little 
                girl.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Only let her come,&quot; said the boy, &quot;I'll set her 
                on the stove<br>
                and then she'll melt.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the grandmother smoothed his hair and told him some more<br>
                tales. One evening, when little Kay was at home, half undressed, 
                he<br>
                climbed on a chair by the window and peeped out through the little<br>
                hole. A few flakes of snow were falling, and one of them, rather<br>
                larger than the rest, alighted on the edge of one of the flower 
                boxes.<br>
                This snow-flake grew larger and larger, till at last it became 
                the<br>
                figure of a woman, dressed in garments of white gauze, which looked<br>
                like millions of starry snow-flakes linked together. She was fair<br>
                and beautiful, but made of ice- shining and glittering ice. Still<br>
                she was alive and her eyes sparkled like bright stars, but there 
                was<br>
                neither peace nor rest in their glance. She nodded towards the<br>
                window and waved her hand. The little boy was frightened and sprang 
                from the chair; at the same moment it seemed as if a large bird 
                flew by the window. On the following day there was a clear frost, 
                and<br>
                very soon came the spring. The sun shone; the young green leaves 
                burst forth; the swallows built their nests; windows were opened, 
                and the children sat once more in the garden on the roof, high 
                above all the other rooms. How beautiful the roses blossomed this 
                summer. </p>
              <p>The little girl had learnt a hymn in which roses were spoken 
                of, and then she thought of their own roses, and she sang the 
                hymn to the little boy, and he sang too:-</p>
              <p> &quot;Roses bloom and cease to be,<br>
                But we shall the Christ-child see.&quot;</p>
              <p>Then the little ones held each other by the hand, and kissed 
                the<br>
                roses, and looked at the bright sunshine, and spoke to it as if 
                the<br>
                Christ-child were there. Those were splendid summer days. How<br>
                beautiful and fresh it was out among the rose-bushes, which seemed<br>
                as if they would never leave off blooming. One day Kay and Gerda 
                sat looking at a book full of pictures of animals and birds, and 
                then just as the clock in the church tower struck twelve, Kay 
                said, &quot;Oh,<br>
                something has struck my heart!&quot; and soon after, &quot;There 
                is something in my eye.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The little girl put her arm round his neck, and looked into his<br>
                eye, but she could see nothing.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I think it is gone,&quot; he said. But it was not gone; 
                it was one<br>
                of those bits of the looking-glass- that magic mirror, of which 
                we<br>
                have spoken- the ugly glass which made everything great and good<br>
                appear small and ugly, while all that was wicked and bad became 
                more visible, and every little fault could be plainly seen. Poor 
                little Kay had also received a small grain in his heart, which 
                very quickly<br>
                turned to a lump of ice. He felt no more pain, but the glass was 
                there<br>
                still. &quot;Why do you cry?&quot; said he at last; &quot;it makes 
                you look ugly.<br>
                There is nothing the matter with me now. Oh, see!&quot; he cried<br>
                suddenly, &quot;that rose is worm-eaten, and this one is quite 
                crooked.<br>
                After all they are ugly roses, just like the box in which they 
                stand,&quot;<br>
                and then he kicked the boxes with his foot, and pulled off the 
                two<br>
                roses.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Kay, what are you doing?&quot; cried the little girl; and 
                then, when<br>
                he saw how frightened she was, he tore off another rose, and jumped<br>
                through his own window away from little Gerda.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When she afterwards brought out the picture book, he said, &quot;It 
                was<br>
                only fit for babies in long clothes,&quot; and when grandmother 
                told any<br>
                stories, he would interrupt her with &quot;but;&quot; or, when 
                he could manage<br>
                it, he would get behind her chair, put on a pair of spectacles, 
                and<br>
                imitate her very cleverly, to make people laugh. By-and-by he 
                began to mimic the speech and gait of persons in the street. All 
                that was<br>
                peculiar or disagreeable in a person he would imitate directly, 
                and<br>
                people said, &quot;That boy will be very clever; he has a remarkable<br>
                genius.&quot; But it was the piece of glass in his eye, and the 
                coldness in<br>
                his heart, that made him act like this. He would even tease little<br>
                Gerda, who loved him with all her heart. His games, too, were 
                quite<br>
                different; they were not so childish. One winter's day, when it<br>
                snowed, he brought out a burning-glass, then he held out the tail 
                of<br>
                his blue coat, and let the snow-flakes fall upon it. &quot;Look 
                in this<br>
                glass, Gerda,&quot; said he; and she saw how every flake of snow 
                was<br>
                magnified, and looked like a beautiful flower or a glittering 
                star.<br>
                &quot;Is it not clever?&quot; said Kay, &quot;and much more interesting 
                than<br>
                looking at real flowers. There is not a single fault in it, and 
                the<br>
                snow-flakes are quite perfect till they begin to melt.&quot;<br>
                Soon after Kay made his appearance in large thick gloves, and 
                with<br>
                his sledge at his back. He called up stairs to Gerda, &quot;I've 
                got to<br>
                leave to go into the great square, where the other boys play and<br>
                ride.&quot; And away he went.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the great square, the boldest among the boys would often tie<br>
                their sledges to the country people's carts, and go with them 
                a good<br>
                way. This was capital. But while they were all amusing themselves, 
                and Kay with them, a great sledge came by; it was painted white, 
                and in it sat some one wrapped in a rough white fur, and wearing 
                a white cap.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The sledge drove twice round the square, and Kay fastened his 
                own<br>
                little sledge to it, so that when it went away, he followed with 
                it.<br>
                It went faster and faster right through the next street, and then<br>
                the person who drove turned round and nodded pleasantly to Kay, 
                just as if they were acquainted with each other, but whenever 
                Kay wished to loosen his little sledge the driver nodded again, 
                so Kay sat still, and they drove out through the town gate. Then 
                the snow began to fall so heavily that the little boy could not 
                see a hand's breadth<br>
                before him, but still they drove on; then he suddenly loosened 
                the<br>
                cord so that the large sled might go on without him, but it was 
                of<br>
                no use, his little carriage held fast, and away they went like 
                the<br>
                wind. Then he called out loudly, but nobody heard him, while the<br>
                snow beat upon him, and the sledge flew onwards. Every now and 
                then it gave a jump as if it were going over hedges and ditches. 
                The boy was frightened, and tried to say a prayer, but he could 
                remember nothing but the multiplication table.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The snow-flakes became larger and larger, till they appeared<br>
                like great white chickens. All at once they sprang on one side, 
                the<br>
                great sledge stopped, and the person who had driven it rose up. 
                The<br>
                fur and the cap, which were made entirely of snow, fell off, and 
                he<br>
                saw a lady, tall and white, it was the Snow Queen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We have driven well,&quot; said she, &quot;but why do you 
                tremble? here,<br>
                creep into my warm fur.&quot; Then she seated him beside her in 
                the sledge, and as she wrapped the fur round him he felt as if 
                he were sinking into a snow drift.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Are you still cold,&quot; she asked, as she kissed him 
                on the<br>
                forehead. The kiss was colder than ice; it went quite through 
                to his<br>
                heart, which was already almost a lump of ice; he felt as if he 
                were<br>
                going to die, but only for a moment; he soon seemed quite well<br>
                again, and did not notice the cold around him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;My sledge! don't forget my sledge,&quot; was his first 
                thought, and<br>
                then he looked and saw that it was bound fast to one of the white<br>
                chickens, which flew behind him with the sledge at its back. The<br>
                Snow Queen kissed little Kay again, and by this time he had<br>
                forgotten little Gerda, his grandmother, and all at home.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now you must have no more kisses,&quot; she said, &quot;or 
                I should kiss<br>
                you to death.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Kay looked at her, and saw that she was so beautiful, he could 
                not<br>
                imagine a more lovely and intelligent face; she did not now seem 
                to be<br>
                made of ice, as when he had seen her through his window, and she 
                had nodded to him. In his eyes she was perfect, and she did not 
                feel at all afraid. He told her he could do mental arithmetic, 
                as far as<br>
                fractions, and that he knew the number of square miles and the<br>
                number of inhabitants in the country. And she always smiled so 
                that he thought he did not know enough yet, and she looked round 
                the vast expanse as she flew higher and higher with him upon a 
                black cloud, while the storm blew and howled as if it were singing 
                old songs.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They flew over woods and lakes, over sea and land; below them 
                roared the wild wind; the wolves howled and the snow crackled; 
                over them flew the black screaming crows, and above all shone 
                the moon, clear and bright,- and so Kay passed through the long 
                winter's night, and by day he slept at the feet of the Snow Queen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>THIRD STORY<br>
                THE FLOWER GARDEN OF THE WOMAN<br>
                WHO COULD CONJURE</p>
              <p> But how fared little Gerda during Kay's absence? What had become<br>
                of him, no one knew, nor could any one give the slightest information,<br>
                excepting the boys, who said that he had tied his sledge to another<br>
                very large one, which had driven through the street, and out at 
                the<br>
                town gate. Nobody knew where it went; many tears were shed for 
                him, and little Gerda wept bitterly for a long time. She said 
                she knew he must be dead; that he was drowned in the river which 
                flowed close by the school. Oh, indeed those long winter days 
                were very dreary. </p>
              <p>But at last spring came, with warm sunshine. &quot;Kay is dead 
                and gone,&quot; said little Gerda.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I don't believe it,&quot; said the sunshine.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He is dead and gone,&quot; she said to the sparrows.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We don't believe it,&quot; they replied; and at last little 
                Gerda<br>
                began to doubt it herself. &quot;I will put on my new red shoes,&quot; 
                she<br>
                said one morning, &quot;those that Kay has never seen, and then 
                I will go<br>
                down to the river, and ask for him.&quot; It was quite early when 
                she<br>
                kissed her old grandmother, who was still asleep; then she put 
                on<br>
                her red shoes, and went quite alone out of the town gates toward 
                the<br>
                river. &quot;Is it true that you have taken my little playmate 
                away from<br>
                me?&quot; said she to the river. &quot;I will give you my red 
                shoes if you<br>
                will give him back to me.&quot; And it seemed as if the waves 
                nodded to her in a strange manner. Then she took off her red shoes, 
                which she<br>
                liked better than anything else, and threw them both into the 
                river,<br>
                but they fell near the bank, and the little waves carried them 
                back to<br>
                the land, just as if the river would not take from her what she<br>
                loved best, because they could not give her back little Kay. But 
                she<br>
                thought the shoes had not been thrown out far enough. Then she 
                crept into a boat that lay among the reeds, and threw the shoes 
                again from the farther end of the boat into the water, but it 
                was not fastened.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And her movement sent it gliding away from the land. When she 
                saw this she hastened to reach the end of the boat, but before 
                she could so it was more than a yard from the bank, and drifting 
                away faster than ever. Then little Gerda was very much frightened, 
                and began to cry, but no one heard her except the sparrows, and 
                they could not carry her to land, but they flew along by the shore, 
                and sang, as if to<br>
                comfort her, &quot;Here we are! Here we are!&quot; The boat floated 
                with the<br>
                stream; little Gerda sat quite still with only her stockings on 
                her<br>
                feet; the red shoes floated after her, but she could not reach 
                them<br>
                because the boat kept so much in advance. The banks on each side 
                of the river were very pretty. There were beautiful flowers, old 
                trees,<br>
                sloping fields, in which cows and sheep were grazing, but not 
                a man to be seen. Perhaps the river will carry me to little Kay, 
                thought Gerda, and then she became more cheerful, and raised her 
                head, and looked at the beautiful green banks; and so the boat 
                sailed on for hours.<br>
              </p>
              <p>At length she came to a large cherry orchard, in which stood 
                a small<br>
                red house with strange red and blue windows. It had also a thatched<br>
                roof, and outside were two wooden soldiers, that presented arms 
                to her as she sailed past. Gerda called out to them, for she thought 
                they<br>
                were alive, but of course they did not answer; and as the boat 
                drifted<br>
                nearer to the shore, she saw what they really were. Then Gerda<br>
                called still louder, and there came a very old woman out of the 
                house,<br>
                leaning on a crutch. She wore a large hat to shade her from the 
                sun,<br>
                and on it were painted all sorts of pretty flowers. &quot;You 
                poor little<br>
                child,&quot; said the old woman, &quot;how did you manage to come 
                all this<br>
                distance into the wide world on such a rapid rolling stream?&quot; 
                And then the old woman walked in the water, seized the boat with 
                her crutch, drew it to land, and lifted Gerda out. And Gerda was 
                glad to feel herself on dry ground, although she was rather afraid 
                of the strange old woman. &quot;Come and tell me who you are,&quot; 
                said she, &quot;and how came you here.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then Gerda told her everything, while the old woman shook her<br>
                head, and said, &quot;Hem-hem;&quot; and when she had finished, 
                Gerda asked if she had not seen little Kay, and the old woman 
                told her he had not<br>
                passed by that way, but he very likely would come. So she told 
                Gerda not to be sorrowful, but to taste the cherries and look 
                at the<br>
                flowers; they were better than any picture-book, for each of them<br>
                could tell a story. Then she took Gerda by the hand and led her 
                into<br>
                the little house, and the old woman closed the door. The windows<br>
                were very high, and as the panes were red, blue, and yellow, the<br>
                daylight shone through them in all sorts of singular colors. On 
                the<br>
                table stood beautiful cherries, and Gerda had permission to eat 
                as<br>
                many as she would. While she was eating them the old woman combed 
                out her long flaxen ringlets with a golden comb, and the glossy 
                curls hung down on each side of the little round pleasant face,<br>
                which looked fresh and blooming as a rose. &quot;I have long been 
                wishing for a dear little maiden like you,&quot; said the old 
                woman, &quot;and now you must stay with me, and see how happily 
                we shall live together.&quot; And while she went on combing little 
                Gerda's hair, she thought less and less about her adopted brother 
                Kay, for the old woman could conjure, although she was not a wicked 
                witch; she conjured only a little for her own amusement, and now, 
                because she wanted to keep Gerda.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Therefore she went into the garden, and stretched out her crutch<br>
                towards all the rose-trees, beautiful though they were; and they<br>
                immediately sunk into the dark earth, so that no one could tell<br>
                where they had once stood. The old woman was afraid that if little<br>
                Gerda saw roses she would think of those at home, and then remember 
                little Kay, and run away. Then she took Gerda into the<br>
                flower-garden. How fragrant and beautiful it was! Every flower 
                that<br>
                could be thought of for every season of the year was here in full<br>
                bloom; no picture-book could have more beautiful colors. Gerda<br>
                jumped for joy, and played till the sun went down behind the tall<br>
                cherry-trees; then she slept in an elegant bed with red silk<br>
                pillows, embroidered with colored violets; and then she dreamed 
                as<br>
                pleasantly as a queen on her wedding day. The next day, and for 
                many days after, Gerda played with the flowers in the warm sunshine. 
              </p>
              <p>She knew every flower, and yet, although there were so many of 
                them, it seemed as if one were missing, but which it was she could 
                not tell.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One day, however, as she sat looking at the old woman's hat with 
                the<br>
                painted flowers on it, she saw that the prettiest of them all 
                was a<br>
                rose. The old woman had forgotten to take it from her hat when 
                she<br>
                made all the roses sink into the earth. But it is difficult to 
                keep<br>
                the thoughts together in everything; one little mistake upsets 
                all our<br>
                arrangements.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What, are there no roses here?&quot; cried Gerda; and she 
                ran out into<br>
                the garden, and examined all the beds, and searched and searched.<br>
                There was not one to be found. Then she sat down and wept, and 
                her<br>
                tears fell just on the place where one of the rose-trees had sunk<br>
                down. The warm tears moistened the earth, and the rose-tree sprouted 
                up at once, as blooming as when it had sunk; and Gerda embraced 
                it and kissed the roses, and thought of the beautiful roses at 
                home, and, with them, of little Kay.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, how I have been detained!&quot; said the little maiden, 
                &quot;I<br>
                wanted to seek for little Kay. Do you know where he is?&quot; 
                she asked the roses; &quot;do you think he is dead?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the roses answered, &quot;No, he is not dead. We have been 
                in the<br>
                ground where all the dead lie; but Kay is not there.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said little Gerda, and then she went to 
                the other<br>
                flowers, and looked into their little cups, and asked, &quot;Do 
                you know<br>
                where little Kay is?&quot; But each flower, as it stood in the 
                sunshine,<br>
                dreamed only of its own little fairy tale of history. Not one 
                knew<br>
                anything of Kay. Gerda heard many stories from the flowers, as 
                she<br>
                asked them one after another about him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And what, said the tiger-lily? &quot;Hark, do you hear the drum? 
                -<br>
                'turn, turn,'- there are only two notes, always, 'turn, turn.'<br>
                Listen to the women's song of mourning! Hear the cry of the priest! 
                In her long red robe stands the Hindoo widow by the funeral pile. 
                The<br>
                flames rise around her as she places herself on the dead body 
                of her<br>
                husband; but the Hindoo woman is thinking of the living one in 
                that<br>
                circle; of him, her son, who lighted those flames. Those shining<br>
                eyes trouble her heart more painfully than the flames which will<br>
                soon consume her body to ashes. Can the fire of the heart be<br>
                extinguished in the flames of the funeral pile?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I don't understand that at all,&quot; said little Gerda.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is my story,&quot; said the tiger-lily.<br>
              </p>
              <p>What, says the convolvulus? &quot;Near yonder narrow road stands 
                an old<br>
                knight's castle; thick ivy creeps over the old ruined walls, leaf 
                over<br>
                leaf, even to the balcony, in which stands a beautiful maiden. 
                She<br>
                bends over the balustrades, and looks up the road. No rose on 
                its stem is fresher than she; no apple-blossom, wafted by the 
                wind, floats more lightly than she moves. Her rich silk rustles 
                as she bends over and exclaims, 'Will he not come?'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Is it Kay you mean?&quot; asked Gerda.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I am only speaking of a story of my dream,&quot; replied 
                the flower.<br>
                What, said the little snow-drop? &quot;Between two trees a rope 
                is<br>
                hanging; there is a piece of board upon it; it is a swing. Two<br>
                pretty little girls, in dresses white as snow, and with long green<br>
                ribbons fluttering from their hats, are sitting upon it swinging.<br>
                Their brother who is taller than they are, stands in the swing; 
                he has<br>
                one arm round the rope, to steady himself; in one hand he holds 
                a<br>
                little bowl, and in the other a clay pipe; he is blowing bubbles. 
                As<br>
                the swing goes on, the bubbles fly upward, reflecting the most<br>
                beautiful varying colors. The last still hangs from the bowl of 
                the<br>
                pipe, and sways in the wind. On goes the swing; and then a little<br>
                black dog comes running up. He is almost as light as the bubble, 
                and<br>
                he raises himself on his hind legs, and wants to be taken into 
                the<br>
                swing; but it does not stop, and the dog falls; then he barks 
                and gets<br>
                angry. The children stoop towards him, and the bubble bursts. 
                A<br>
                swinging plank, a light sparkling foam picture,- that is my story.&quot;<br>
                &quot;It may be all very pretty what you are telling me,&quot; 
                said little<br>
                Gerda, &quot;but you speak so mournfully, and you do not mention 
                little Kay at all.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>What do the hyacinths say? &quot;There were three beautiful sisters,<br>
                fair and delicate. The dress of one was red, of the second blue, 
                and<br>
                of the third pure white. Hand in hand they danced in the bright<br>
                moonlight, by the calm lake; but they were human beings, not fairy<br>
                elves. The sweet fragrance attracted them, and they disappeared 
                in the<br>
                wood; here the fragrance became stronger. Three coffins, in which<br>
                lay the three beautiful maidens, glided from the thickest part 
                of<br>
                the forest across the lake. The fire-flies flew lightly over them,<br>
                like little floating torches. Do the dancing maidens sleep, or 
                are<br>
                they dead? The scent of the flower says that they are corpses. 
                The<br>
                evening bell tolls their knell.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You make me quite sorrowful,&quot; said little Gerda; &quot;your 
                perfume is<br>
                so strong, you make me think of the dead maidens. Ah! is little 
                Kay<br>
                really dead then? The roses have been in the earth, and they say 
                no.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Cling, clang,&quot; tolled the hyacinth bells. &quot;We 
                are not tolling for<br>
                little Kay; we do not know him. We sing our song, the only one 
                we<br>
                know.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then Gerda went to the buttercups that were glittering amongst 
                the<br>
                bright green leaves.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are little bright suns,&quot; said Gerda; &quot;tell 
                me if you know<br>
                where I can find my play-fellow.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the buttercups sparkled gayly, and looked again at Gerda. 
                What<br>
                song could the buttercups sing? It was not about Kay.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The bright warm sun shone on a little court, on the first 
                warm<br>
                day of spring. His bright beams rested on the white walls of the<br>
                neighboring house; and close by bloomed the first yellow flower 
                of the season, glittering like gold in the sun's warm ray. An 
                old woman sat in her arm chair at the house door, and her granddaughter, 
                a poor<br>
                and pretty servant-maid came to see her for a short visit. When 
                she<br>
                kissed her grandmother there was gold everywhere: the gold of 
                the<br>
                heart in that holy kiss; it was a golden morning; there was gold 
                in<br>
                the beaming sunlight, gold in the leaves of the lowly flower, 
                and on<br>
                the lips of the maiden. There, that is my story,&quot; said the 
                buttercup.<br>
                &quot;My poor old grandmother!&quot; sighed Gerda; &quot;she is 
                longing to see<br>
                me, and grieving for me as she did for little Kay; but I shall 
                soon go<br>
                home now, and take little Kay with me. It is no use asking the<br>
                flowers; they know only their own songs, and can give me no<br>
                information.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And then she tucked up her little dress, that she might run<br>
                faster, but the narcissus caught her by the leg as she was jumping<br>
                over it; so she stopped and looked at the tall yellow flower, 
                and<br>
                said, &quot;Perhaps you may know something.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then she stooped down quite close to the flower, and listened; 
                and<br>
                what did he say?<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I can see myself, I can see myself,&quot; said the narcissus. 
                &quot;Oh, how<br>
                sweet is my perfume! Up in a little room with a bow window, stands 
                a<br>
                little dancing girl, half undressed; she stands sometimes on one<br>
                leg, and sometimes on both, and looks as if she would tread the<br>
                whole world under her feet. She is nothing but a delusion. She 
                is<br>
                pouring water out of a tea-pot on a piece of stuff which she holds<br>
                in her hand; it is her bodice. 'Cleanliness is a good thing,' 
                she<br>
                says. Her white dress hangs on a peg; it has also been washed 
                in the<br>
                tea-pot, and dried on the roof. She puts it on, and ties a<br>
                saffron-colored handkerchief round her neck, which makes the dress<br>
                look whiter. See how she stretches out her legs, as if she were<br>
                showing off on a stem. I can see myself, I can see myself.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What do I care for all that,&quot; said Gerda, &quot;you 
                need not tell me<br>
                such stuff.&quot; And then she ran to the other end of the garden. 
                The door was fastened, but she pressed against the rusty latch, 
                and it gave<br>
                way. The door sprang open, and little Gerda ran out with bare 
                feet<br>
                into the wide world. She looked back three times, but no one seemed 
                to be following her. At last she could run no longer, so she sat 
                down<br>
                to rest on a great stone, and when she looked round she saw that 
                the<br>
                summer was over, and autumn very far advanced. She had known nothing 
                of this in the beautiful garden, where the sun shone and the flowers 
                grew all the year round.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, how I have wasted my time?&quot; said little Gerda; 
                &quot;it is autumn.<br>
                I must not rest any longer,&quot; and she rose up to go on. But 
                her<br>
                little feet were wounded and sore, and everything around her looked 
                so cold and bleak. The long willow-leaves were quite yellow. The<br>
                dew-drops fell like water, leaf after leaf dropped from the trees, 
                the<br>
                sloe-thorn alone still bore fruit, but the sloes were sour, and 
                set<br>
                the teeth on edge. Oh, how dark and weary the whole world appeared!<br>
              </p>
              <p>FOURTH STORY<br>
                THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS</p>
              <p> Gerda was obliged to rest again, and just opposite the place 
                where<br>
                she sat, she saw a great crow come hopping across the snow toward 
                her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He stood looking at her for some time, and then he wagged his 
                head and said, &quot;Caw, caw; good-day, good-day.&quot; He pronounced 
                the words as plainly as he could, because he meant to be kind 
                to the little girl; and then he asked her where she was going 
                all alone in the wide world.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The word alone Gerda understood very well, and knew how much 
                it<br>
                expressed. So then she told the crow the whole story of her life 
                and<br>
                adventures, and asked him if he had seen little Kay.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The crow nodded his head very gravely, and said, &quot;Perhaps 
                I<br>
                have- it may be.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No! Do you think you have?&quot; cried little Gerda, and 
                she kissed<br>
                the crow, and hugged him almost to death with joy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Gently, gently,&quot; said the crow. &quot;I believe I 
                know. I think it may<br>
                be little Kay; but he has certainly forgotten you by this time 
                for the<br>
                princess.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Does he live with a princess?&quot; asked Gerda.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, listen,&quot; replied the crow, &quot;but it is so 
                difficult to<br>
                speak your language. If you understand the crows' language then 
                I<br>
                can explain it better. Do you?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, I have never learnt it,&quot; said Gerda, but my grandmother<br>
                understands it, and used to speak it to me. I wish I had learnt 
                it.&quot;<br>
                &quot;It does not matter,&quot; answered the crow; &quot;I will 
                explain as well<br>
                as I can, although it will be very badly done;&quot; and he told 
                her what<br>
                he had heard. &quot;In this kingdom where we now are,&quot; said 
                he, &quot;there<br>
                lives a princess, who is so wonderfully clever that she has read 
                all<br>
                the newspapers in the world, and forgotten them too, although 
                she is<br>
                so clever. A short time ago, as she was sitting on her throne, 
                which<br>
                people say is not such an agreeable seat as is often supposed, 
                she<br>
                began to sing a song which commences in these words:</p>
              <p> 'Why should I not be married?'</p>
              <p>'Why not indeed?' said she, and so she determined to marry if 
                she<br>
                could find a husband who knew what to say when he was spoken to, 
                and not one who could only look grand, for that was so tiresome. 
                Then she assembled all her court ladies together at the beat of 
                the drum, and when they heard of her intentions they were very 
                much pleased. 'We are so glad to hear it,' said they, we were 
                talking about it ourselves the other day.' You may believe that 
                every word I tell you is true,&quot; said the crow, &quot;for 
                I have a tame sweetheart who goes freely about the palace, and 
                she told me all this.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Of course his sweetheart was a crow, for &quot;birds of a feather 
                flock<br>
                together,&quot; and one crow always chooses another crow.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Newspapers were published immediately, with a border of 
                hearts,<br>
                and the initials of the princess among them. They gave notice 
                that<br>
                every young man who was handsome was free to visit the castle 
                and<br>
                speak with the princess; and those who could reply loud enough 
                to be heard when spoken to, were to make themselves quite at home 
                at the palace; but the one who spoke best would be chosen as a 
                husband for the princess. Yes, yes, you may believe me, it is 
                all as true as I sit here,&quot; said the crow. &quot;The people 
                came in crowds. There was a great deal of crushing and running 
                about, but no one succeeded either on the first or second day. 
                They could all speak very well while they were outside in the 
                streets, but when they entered the palace gates, and saw the guards 
                in silver uniforms, and the footmen in their golden livery on 
                the staircase, and the great halls lighted up, they became quite 
                confused. And when they stood before the throne on which the princess 
                sat, they could do nothing but repeat the last words she had said; 
                and she had no particular wish to hear her own words over again. 
                It was just as if they had all taken something to make them sleepy 
                while they were in the palace, for they did not recover themselves 
                nor speak till they got back again into the street. </p>
              <p>There was quite a long line of them reaching from the town-gate 
                to the<br>
                palace. I went myself to see them,&quot; said the crow. &quot;They 
                were hungry<br>
                and thirsty, for at the palace they did not get even a glass of 
                water.<br>
                Some of the wisest had taken a few slices of bread and butter 
                with<br>
                them, but they did not share it with their neighbors; they thought<br>
                if they went in to the princess looking hungry, there would be 
                a<br>
                better chance for themselves.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But Kay! tell me about little Kay!&quot; said Gerda, &quot;was 
                he amongst<br>
                the crowd?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Stop a bit, we are just coming to him. It was on the third 
                day,<br>
                there came marching cheerfully along to the palace a little personage,<br>
                without horses or carriage, his eyes sparkling like yours; he 
                had<br>
                beautiful long hair, but his clothes were very poor.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That was Kay!&quot; said Gerda joyfully. &quot;Oh, then 
                I have found<br>
                him;&quot; and she clapped her hands.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He had a little knapsack on his back,&quot; added the crow.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, it must have been his sledge,&quot; said Gerda; &quot;for 
                he went<br>
                away with it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It may have been so,&quot; said the crow; &quot;I did not 
                look at it very<br>
                closely. But I know from my tame sweetheart that he passed through 
                the palace gates, saw the guards in their silver uniform, and 
                the servants in their liveries of gold on the stairs, but he was 
                not in the least embarrassed. 'It must be very tiresome to stand 
                on the stairs,' he<br>
                said. 'I prefer to go in.&quot; The rooms were blazing with light.<br>
                Councillors and ambassadors walked about with bare feet, carrying<br>
                golden vessels; it was enough to make any one feel serious. His<br>
                boots creaked loudly as he walked, and yet he was not at all uneasy.&quot;<br>
                &quot;It must be Kay,&quot; said Gerda, &quot;I know he had new 
                boots on, I<br>
                have heard them creak in grandmother's room.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;They really did creak,&quot; said the crow, &quot;yet he 
                went boldly up<br>
                to the princess herself, who was sitting on a pearl as large as 
                a<br>
                spinning wheel, and all the ladies of the court were present with<br>
                their maids, and all the cavaliers with their servants; and each 
                of<br>
                the maids had another maid to wait upon her, and the cavaliers'<br>
                servants had their own servants, as well as a page each. They 
                all<br>
                stood in circles round the princess, and the nearer they stood 
                to<br>
                the door, the prouder they looked. The servants' pages, who always<br>
                wore slippers, could hardly be looked at, they held themselves 
                up so<br>
                proudly by the door.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It must be quite awful,&quot; said little Gerda, &quot;but 
                did Kay win<br>
                the princess?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;If I had not been a crow,&quot; said he, &quot;I would 
                have married her<br>
                myself, although I am engaged. He spoke just as well as I do, 
                when I<br>
                speak the crows' language, so I heard from my tame sweetheart. 
                He<br>
                was quite free and agreeable and said he had not come to woo the<br>
                princess, but to hear her wisdom; and he was as pleased with her 
                as<br>
                she was with him.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, certainly that was Kay,&quot; said Gerda, &quot;he 
                was so clever; he<br>
                could work mental arithmetic and fractions. Oh, will you take 
                me to<br>
                the palace?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is very easy to ask that,&quot; replied the crow, &quot;but 
                how are we<br>
                to manage it? However, I will speak about it to my tame sweetheart,<br>
                and ask her advice; for I must tell you it will be very difficult 
                to<br>
                gain permission for a little girl like you to enter the palace.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, yes; but I shall gain permission easily,&quot; said 
                Gerda, &quot;for<br>
                when Kay hears that I am here, he will come out and fetch me in<br>
                immediately.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Wait for me here by the palings,&quot; said the crow, wagging 
                his head<br>
                as he flew away.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was late in the evening before the crow returned. &quot;Caw, 
                caw,&quot;<br>
                he said, she sends you greeting, and here is a little roll which 
                she<br>
                took from the kitchen for you; there is plenty of bread there, 
                and she<br>
                thinks you must be hungry. It is not possible for you to enter 
                the<br>
                palace by the front entrance. The guards in silver uniform and 
                the<br>
                servants in gold livery would not allow it. But do not cry, we 
                will<br>
                manage to get you in; my sweetheart knows a little back-staircase 
                that<br>
                leads to the sleeping apartments, and she knows where to find 
                the<br>
                key.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then they went into the garden through the great avenue, where 
                the<br>
                leaves were falling one after another, and they could see the 
                light in<br>
                the palace being put out in the same manner. And the crow led 
                little<br>
                Gerda to the back door, which stood ajar. Oh! how little Gerda's 
                heart beat with anxiety and longing; it was just as if she were 
                going to<br>
                do something wrong, and yet she only wanted to know where little 
                Kay was. &quot;It must be he,&quot; she thought, &quot;with those 
                clear eyes, and that long hair.&quot; She could fancy she saw 
                him smiling at her, as he used to at home, when they sat among 
                the roses. He would certainly be glad to see her, and to hear 
                what a long distance she had come for his sake, and to know how 
                sorry they had been at home because he did not come back. Oh what 
                joy and yet fear she felt! They were now on the stairs, and in 
                a small closet at the top a lamp was burning. In the middle of 
                the floor stood the tame crow, turning her head from side to side, 
                and gazing at Gerda, who curtseyed as her grandmother had taught 
                her to do.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;My betrothed has spoken so very highly of you, my little 
                lady,&quot;<br>
                said the tame crow, &quot;your life-history, Vita, as it may be 
                called,<br>
                is very touching. If you will take the lamp I will walk before 
                you. We<br>
                will go straight along this way, then we shall meet no one.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It seems to me as if somebody were behind us,&quot; said 
                Gerda, as<br>
                something rushed by her like a shadow on the wall, and then horses<br>
                with flying manes and thin legs, hunters, ladies and gentlemen 
                on<br>
                horseback, glided by her, like shadows on the wall.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;They are only dreams,&quot; said the crow, &quot;they are 
                coming to fetch<br>
                the thoughts of the great people out hunting.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;All the better, for we shall be able to look at them in 
                their<br>
                beds more safely. I hope that when you rise to honor and favor, 
                you<br>
                will show a grateful heart.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You may be quite sure of that,&quot; said the crow from 
                the forest.<br>
                They now came into the first hall, the walls of which were hung<br>
                with rose-colored satin, embroidered with artificial flowers. 
                Here the<br>
                dreams again flitted by them but so quickly that Gerda could not<br>
                distinguish the royal persons. Each hall appeared more splendid 
                than<br>
                the last, it was enought to bewilder any one. At length they reached 
                a<br>
                bedroom. The ceiling was like a great palm-tree, with glass leaves<br>
                of the most costly crystal, and over the centre of the floor two 
                beds,<br>
                each resembling a lily, hung from a stem of gold. One, in which 
                the<br>
                princess lay, was white, the other was red; and in this Gerda 
                had to<br>
                seek for little Kay. She pushed one of the red leaves aside, and 
                saw a<br>
                little brown neck. Oh, that must be Kay! She called his name out 
                quite<br>
                loud, and held the lamp over him. The dreams rushed back into 
                the room on horseback. He woke, and turned his head round, it 
                was not little Kay! The prince was only like him in the neck, 
                still he was young<br>
                and pretty. Then the princess peeped out of her white-lily bed, 
                and<br>
                asked what was the matter. Then little Gerda wept and told her<br>
                story, and all that the crows had done to help her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You poor child,&quot; said the prince and princess; then 
                they<br>
                praised the crows, and said they were not angry for what they 
                had<br>
                done, but that it must not happen again, and this time they should<br>
                be rewarded.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Would you like to have your freedom?&quot; asked the princess, 
                &quot;or<br>
                would you prefer to be raised to the position of court crows, 
                with all<br>
                that is left in the kitchen for yourselves?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then both the crows bowed, and begged to have a fixed appointment, 
                for they thought of their old age, and said it would be so comfortable 
                to feel that they had provision for their old days, as they called 
                it. And then the prince got out of his bed, and gave it up to 
                Gerda,- he could do no more; and she lay down. She folded her 
                little hands, and thought, &quot;How good everyone is to me, men 
                and animals too;&quot; then she closed her eyes and fell into 
                a sweet sleep. All the dreams came flying back again to her, and 
                they looked like angels, and one of them drew a little sledge, 
                on which sat Kay, and nodded to her. But all this was only a dream, 
                and vanished as soon as she awoke.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The following day she was dressed from head to foot in silk and<br>
                velvet, and they invited her to stay at the palace for a few days, 
                and<br>
                enjoy herself, but she only begged for a pair of boots, and a 
                little<br>
                carriage, and a horse to draw it, so that she might go into the 
                wide<br>
                world to seek for Kay. And she obtained, not only boots, but also 
                a<br>
                muff, and she was neatly dressed; and when she was ready to go, 
                there, at the door, she found a coach made of pure gold, with 
                the<br>
                coat-of-arms of the prince and princess shining upon it like a 
                star,<br>
                and the coachman, footman, and outriders all wearing golden crowns<br>
                on their heads. The prince and princess themselves helped her 
                into the coach, and wished her success. The forest crow, who was 
                now married, accompanied her for the first three miles; he sat 
                by Gerda's side, as he could not bear riding backwards. The tame 
                crow stood in the door-way flapping her wings. She could not go 
                with them, because she had been suffering from headache ever since 
                the new appointment, no doubt from eating too much. The coach 
                was well stored with sweet cakes, and under the seat were fruit 
                and gingerbread nuts.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Farewell, farewell,&quot; cried the prince and princess, 
                and little<br>
                Gerda wept, and the crow wept; and then, after a few miles, the 
                crow<br>
                also said &quot;Farewell,&quot; and this was the saddest parting. 
                However, he<br>
                flew to a tree, and stood flapping his black wings as long as 
                he could<br>
                see the coach, which glittered in the bright sunshine.<br>
              </p>
              <p>FIFTH STORY<br>
                LITTLE ROBBER-GIRL</p>
              <p> The coach drove on through a thick forest, where it lighted 
                up the<br>
                way like a torch, and dazzled the eyes of some robbers, who could<br>
                not bear to let it pass them unmolested.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is gold! it is gold!&quot; cried they, rushing forward, 
                and seizing<br>
                the horses. Then they struck the little jockeys, the coachman, 
                and the<br>
                footman dead, and pulled little Gerda out of the carriage.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;She is fat and pretty, and she has been fed with the kernels 
                of<br>
                nuts,&quot; said the old robber-woman, who had a long beard and 
                eyebrows that hung over her eyes. &quot;She is as good as a little 
                lamb; how nice she will taste!&quot; and as she said this, she 
                drew forth a shining knife, that glittered horribly. &quot;Oh!&quot; 
                screamed the old woman the same moment; for her own daughter, 
                who held her back, had bitten her in the ear.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She was a wild and naughty girl, and the mother called her an 
                ugly<br>
                thing, and had not time to kill Gerda.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;She shall play with me,&quot; said the little robber-girl; 
                &quot;she<br>
                shall give me her muff and her pretty dress, and sleep with me 
                in my<br>
                bed.&quot; And then she bit her mother again, and made her spring 
                in the<br>
                air, and jump about; and all the robbers laughed, and said, &quot;See 
                how<br>
                she is dancing with her young cub.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I will have a ride in the coach,&quot; said the little 
                robber-girl;<br>
                and she would have her own way; for she was so self-willed and<br>
                obstinate.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She and Gerda seated themselves in the coach, and drove away, 
                over<br>
                stumps and stones, into the depths of the forest. The little<br>
                robber-girl was about the same size as Gerda, but stronger; she 
                had<br>
                broader shoulders and a darker skin; her eyes were quite black, 
                and<br>
                she had a mournful look. She clasped little Gerda round the waist, 
                and said,-<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;They shall not kill you as long as you don't make us vexed 
                with<br>
                you. I suppose you are a princess.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Gerda; and then she told her all her history, 
                and how<br>
                fond she was of little Kay.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The robber-girl looked earnestly at her, nodded her head slightly,<br>
                and said, &quot;They sha'nt kill you, even if I do get angry with 
                you;<br>
                for I will do it myself.&quot; And then she wiped Gerda's eyes, 
                and stuck<br>
                her own hands in the beautiful muff which was so soft and warm.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The coach stopped in the courtyard of a robber's castle, the 
                walls<br>
                of which were cracked from top to bottom. Ravens and crows flew 
                in and out of the holes and crevices, while great bulldogs, either 
                of which looked as if it could swallow a man, were jumping about; 
                but they were not allowed to bark. In the large and smoky hall 
                a bright fire was burning on the stone floor. There was no chimney; 
                so the smoke went up to the ceiling, and found a way out for itself. 
                Soup was boiling in a large cauldron, and hares and rabbits were 
                roasting on the spit.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You shall sleep with me and all my little animals to-night,&quot; 
                said<br>
                the robber-girl, after they had had something to eat and drink. 
                So she<br>
                took Gerda to a corner of the hall, where some straw and carpets<br>
                were laid down. Above them, on laths and perches, were more than 
                a<br>
                hundred pigeons, who all seemed to be asleep, although they moved<br>
                slightly when the two little girls came near them. &quot;These 
                all belong<br>
                to me,&quot; said the robber-girl; and she seized the nearest 
                to her,<br>
                held it by the feet, and shook it till it flapped its wings. &quot;Kiss<br>
                it,&quot; cried she, flapping it in Gerda's face. &quot;There 
                sit the<br>
                wood-pigeons,&quot; continued she, pointing to a number of laths 
                and a cage which had been fixed into the walls, near one of the 
                openings. </p>
              <p>&quot;Both rascals would fly away directly, if they were not 
                closely locked up. And here is my old sweetheart 'Ba;' and she 
                dragged out a reindeer by the horn; he wore a bright copper ring 
                round his neck, and was tied up. &quot;We are obliged to hold 
                him tight too, or else he would run away from us also. I tickle 
                his neck every evening with my sharp knife, which frightens him 
                very much.&quot; And then the robber-girl drew a long knife from 
                a chink in the wall, and let it slide gently over the reindeer's 
                neck. The poor animal began to kick, and the little<br>
                robber-girl laughed, and pulled down Gerda into bed with her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Will you have that knife with you while you are asleep?&quot; 
                asked<br>
                Gerda, looking at it in great fright.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I always sleep with the knife by me,&quot; said the robber-girl. 
                &quot;No<br>
                one knows what may happen. But now tell me again all about little 
                Kay, and why you went out into the world.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then Gerda repeated her story over again, while the wood-pigeons<br>
                in the cage over her cooed, and the other pigeons slept. The little<br>
                robber-girl put one arm across Gerda's neck, and held the knife 
                in the<br>
                other, and was soon fast asleep and snoring. But Gerda could not 
                close her eyes at all; she knew not whether she was to live or 
                die. The<br>
                robbers sat round the fire, singing and drinking, and the old 
                woman<br>
                stumbled about. It was a terrible sight for a little girl to witness.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the wood-pigeons said, &quot;Coo, coo; we have seen little 
                Kay.<br>
              </p>
              <p>A white fowl carried his sledge, and he sat in the carriage of 
                the<br>
                Snow Queen, which drove through the wood while we were lying in 
                our nest. She blew upon us, and all the young ones died excepting 
                us<br>
                two. Coo, coo.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What are you saying up there?&quot; cried Gerda. &quot;Where 
                was the Snow<br>
                Queen going? Do you know anything about it?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;She was most likely travelling to Lapland, where there 
                is<br>
                always snow and ice. Ask the reindeer that is fastened up there 
                with a<br>
                rope.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, there is always snow and ice,&quot; said the reindeer; 
                &quot;and it is<br>
                a glorious place; you can leap and run about freely on the sparkling<br>
                ice plains. The Snow Queen has her summer tent there, but her 
                strong<br>
                castle is at the North Pole, on an island called Spitzbergen.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, Kay, little Kay!&quot; sighed Gerda.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Lie still,&quot; said the robber-girl, &quot;or I shall 
                run my knife into<br>
                your body.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the morning Gerda told her all that the wood-pigeons had<br>
                said; and the little robber-girl looked quite serious, and nodded<br>
                her head, and said, &quot;That is all talk, that is all talk. 
                Do you know<br>
                where Lapland is?&quot; she asked the reindeer.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Who should know better than I do?&quot; said the animal, 
                while his<br>
                eyes sparkled. &quot;I was born and brought up there, and used 
                to run about the snow-covered plains.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now listen,&quot; said the robber-girl; &quot;all our men 
                are gone away,-<br>
                only mother is here, and here she will stay; but at noon she always<br>
                drinks out of a great bottle, and afterwards sleeps for a little<br>
                while; and then, I'll do something for you.&quot; Then she jumped 
                out of<br>
                bed, clasped her mother round the neck, and pulled her by the 
                beard,<br>
                crying, &quot;My own little nanny goat, good morning.&quot; Then 
                her mother<br>
                filliped her nose till it was quite red; yet she did it all for 
                love.<br>
                When the mother had drunk out of the bottle, and was gone to<br>
                sleep, the little robber-maiden went to the reindeer, and said, 
                &quot;I<br>
                should like very much to tickle your neck a few times more with 
                my<br>
                knife, for it makes you look so funny; but never mind,- I will 
                untie<br>
                your cord, and set you free, so that you may run away to Lapland;<br>
                but you must make good use of your legs, and carry this little<br>
                maiden to the castle of the Snow Queen, where her play-fellow 
                is.<br>
                You have heard what she told me, for she spoke loud enough, and 
                you were listening.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the reindeer jumped for joy; and the little robber-girl<br>
                lifted Gerda on his back, and had the forethought to tie her on, 
                and<br>
                even to give her her own little cushion to sit on.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Here are your fur boots for you,&quot; said she; &quot;for 
                it will be<br>
                very cold; but I must keep the muff; it is so pretty. However, 
                you<br>
                shall not be frozen for the want of it; here are my mother's large<br>
                warm mittens; they will reach up to your elbows. Let me put them 
                on.<br>
                There, now your hands look just like my mother's.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But Gerda wept for joy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I don't like to see you fret,&quot; said the little robber-girl;<br>
                &quot;you ought to look quite happy now; and here are two loaves 
                and a ham, so that you need not starve.&quot; These were fastened 
                on the reindeer, and then the little robber-maiden opened the 
                door, coaxed in all the great dogs, and then cut the string with 
                which the reindeer was fastened, with her sharp knife, and said, 
                &quot;Now run, but mind you take good care of the little girl.&quot; 
                And then Gerda stretched out her hand,<br>
                with the great mitten on it, towards the little robber-girl, and 
                said,<br>
                &quot;Farewell,&quot; and away flew the reindeer, over stumps 
                and stones,<br>
                through the great forest, over marshes and plains, as quickly 
                as he<br>
                could. The wolves howled, and the ravens screamed; while up in 
                the sky quivered red lights like flames of fire. &quot;There are 
                my old northern<br>
                lights,&quot; said the reindeer; &quot;see how they flash.&quot; 
                And he ran on day<br>
                and night still faster and faster, but the loaves and the ham 
                were all<br>
                eaten by the time they reached Lapland.<br>
              </p>
              <p>SIXTH STORY<br>
                THE LAPLAND WOMAN AND THE FINLAND WOMAN</p>
              <p> They stopped at a little hut; it was very mean looking; the 
                roof<br>
                sloped nearly down to the ground, and the door was so low that 
                the<br>
                family had to creep in on their hands and knees, when they went 
                in and out. There was no one at home but an old Lapland woman, 
                who was cooking fish by the light of a train-oil lamp. The reindeer 
                told her<br>
                all about Gerda's story, after having first told his own, which 
                seemed<br>
                to him the most important, but Gerda was so pinched with the cold 
                that she could not speak. &quot;Oh, you poor things,&quot; said 
                the Lapland woman, &quot;you have a long way to go yet. You must 
                travel more than a hundred miles farther, to Finland. The Snow 
                Queen lives there now, and she burns Bengal lights every evening. 
                I will write a few words on a dried stock-fish, for I have no 
                paper, and you can take it from me to the Finland woman who lives 
                there; she can give you better information than I can.&quot; So 
                when Gerda was warmed, and had taken something to eat and drink, 
                the woman wrote a few words on the dried fish, and told Gerda 
                to take great care of it. Then she tied her again on the reindeer, 
                and he set off at full speed. Flash, flash, went the beautiful 
                blue northern lights in the air the whole night long. And at<br>
                length they reached Finland, and knocked at the chimney of the 
                Finland woman's hut, for it had no door above the ground. They 
                crept in, but it was so terribly hot inside that that woman wore 
                scarcely any clothes; she was small and very dirty looking. She 
                loosened little Gerda's dress, and took off the fur boots and 
                the mittens, or Gerda would have been unable to bear the heat; 
                and then she placed a piece of ice on the reindeer's head, and 
                read what was written on the dried fish. After she had read it 
                three times, she knew it by heart, so she popped the fish into 
                the soup saucepan, as she knew it was good to eat, and she never 
                wasted anything. The reindeer told his own story first, and then 
                little Gerda's, and the Finlander twinkled with her clever eyes, 
                but she said nothing. &quot;You are so clever,&quot; said the 
                reindeer; &quot;I know you can tie all the winds of the world 
                with a<br>
                piece of twine. If a sailor unties one knot, he has a fair wind;<br>
                when he unties the second, it blows hard; but if the third and<br>
                fourth are loosened, then comes a storm, which will root up whole<br>
                forests. Cannot you give this little maiden something which will<br>
                make her as strong as twelve men, to overcome the Snow Queen?&quot;<br>
                &quot;The Power of twelve men!&quot; said the Finland woman; &quot;that 
                would<br>
                be of very little use.&quot; But she went to a shelf and took 
                down and<br>
                unrolled a large skin, on which were inscribed wonderful characters,<br>
                and she read till the perspiration ran down from her forehead. 
                But the<br>
                reindeer begged so hard for little Gerda, and Gerda looked at 
                the<br>
                Finland woman with such beseeching tearful eyes, that her own 
                eyes<br>
                began to twinkle again; so she drew the reindeer into a corner, 
                and<br>
                whispered to him while she laid a fresh piece of ice on his head,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Little Kay is really with the Snow Queen, but he finds 
                everything<br>
                there so much to his taste and his liking, that he believes it 
                is<br>
                the finest place in the world; but this is because he has a piece 
                of<br>
                broken glass in his heart, and a little piece of glass in his 
                eye.<br>
                These must be taken out, or he will never be a human being again,<br>
                and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But can you not give little Gerda something to help her 
                to<br>
                conquer this power?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I can give her no greater power than she has already,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                woman; &quot;don't you see how strong that is? How men and animals 
                are<br>
                obliged to serve her, and how well she has got through the world,<br>
                barefooted as she is. She cannot receive any power from me greater<br>
                than she now has, which consists in her own purity and innocence 
                of<br>
                heart. If she cannot herself obtain access to the Snow Queen, 
                and<br>
                remove the glass fragments from little Kay, we can do nothing 
                to<br>
                help her. Two miles from here the Snow Queen's garden begins; 
                you<br>
                can carry the little girl so far, and set her down by the large 
                bush<br>
                which stands in the snow, covered with red berries. Do not stay<br>
                gossiping, but come back here as quickly as you can.&quot; Then 
                the Finland woman lifted little Gerda upon the reindeer, and he 
                ran away with her as quickly as he could.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, I have forgotten my boots and my mittens,&quot; cried 
                little<br>
                Gerda, as soon as she felt the cutting cold, but the reindeer 
                dared<br>
                not stop, so he ran on till he reached the bush with the red<br>
                berries; here he set Gerda down, and he kissed her, and the great<br>
                bright tears trickled over the animal's cheeks; then he left her 
                and<br>
                ran back as fast as he could.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There stood poor Gerda, without shoes, without gloves, in the<br>
                midst of cold, dreary, ice-bound Finland. She ran forwards as<br>
                quickly as she could, when a whole regiment of snow-flakes came<br>
                round her; they did not, however, fall from the sky, which was 
                quite<br>
                clear and glittering with the northern lights. The snow-flakes 
                ran<br>
                along the ground, and the nearer they came to her, the larger 
                they<br>
                appeared. Gerda remembered how large and beautiful they looked 
                through the burning-glass. But these were really larger, and much 
                more terrible, for they were alive, and were the guards of the 
                Snow<br>
                Queen, and had the strangest shapes. Some were like great<br>
                porcupines, others like twisted serpents with their heads stretching<br>
                out, and some few were like little fat bears with their hair bristled;<br>
                but all were dazzlingly white, and all were living snow-flakes. 
                Then<br>
                little Gerda repeated the Lord's Prayer, and the cold was so great<br>
                that she could see her own breath come out of her mouth like steam<br>
                as she uttered the words. The steam appeared to increase, as she<br>
                continued her prayer, till it took the shape of little angels 
                who grew<br>
                larger the moment they touched the earth. They all wore helmets 
                on<br>
                their heads, and carried spears and shields. Their number continued 
                to increase more and more; and by the time Gerda had finished 
                her<br>
                prayers, a whole legion stood round her. They thrust their spears 
                into<br>
                the terrible snow-flakes, so that they shivered into a hundred 
                pieces,<br>
                and little Gerda could go forward with courage and safety. The<br>
                angels stroked her hands and feet, so that she felt the cold less, 
                and<br>
                she hastened on to the Snow Queen's castle.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But now we must see what Kay is doing. In truth he thought not<br>
                of little Gerda, and never supposed she could be standing in the 
                front<br>
                of the palace.<br>
              </p>
              <p>SEVENTH STORY<br>
                OF THE PALACE OF THE SNOW QUEEN<br>
                AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE AT LAST</p>
              <p> The walls of the palace were formed of drifted snow, and the<br>
                windows and doors of the cutting winds. There were more than a 
                hundred rooms in it, all as if they had been formed with snow 
                blown<br>
                together. The largest of them extended for several miles; they 
                were<br>
                all lighted up by the vivid light of the aurora, and they were 
                so<br>
                large and empty, so icy cold and glittering! There were no<br>
                amusements here, not even a little bear's ball, when the storm 
                might<br>
                have been the music, and the bears could have danced on their 
                hind<br>
                legs, and shown their good manners. There were no pleasant games 
                of snap-dragon, or touch, or even a gossip over the tea-table, 
                for the<br>
                young-lady foxes. Empty, vast, and cold were the halls of the 
                Snow<br>
                Queen. The flickering flame of the northern lights could be plainly<br>
                seen, whether they rose high or low in the heavens, from every 
                part of<br>
                the castle. In the midst of its empty, endless hall of snow was 
                a<br>
                frozen lake, broken on its surface into a thousand forms; each 
                piece<br>
                resembled another, from being in itself perfect as a work of art,<br>
                and in the centre of this lake sat the Snow Queen, when she was 
                at<br>
                home. She called the lake &quot;The Mirror of Reason,&quot; and 
                said that it was the best, and indeed the only one in the world.<br>
                Little Kay was quite blue with cold, indeed almost black, but 
                he<br>
                did not feel it; for the Snow Queen had kissed away the icy<br>
                shiverings, and his heart was already a lump of ice. He dragged 
                some<br>
                sharp, flat pieces of ice to and fro, and placed them together 
                in<br>
                all kinds of positions, as if he wished to make something out 
                of them;<br>
                just as we try to form various figures with little tablets of 
                wood<br>
                which we call &quot;a Chinese puzzle.&quot; Kay's fingers were 
                very artistic; it<br>
                was the icy game of reason at which he played, and in his eyes 
                the<br>
                figures were very remarkable, and of the highest importance; this<br>
                opinion was owing to the piece of glass still sticking in his 
                eye.<br>
                He composed many complete figures, forming different words, but<br>
                there was one word he never could manage to form, although he 
                wished<br>
                it very much. It was the word &quot;Eternity.&quot; The Snow Queen 
                had said to<br>
                him, &quot;When you can find out this, you shall be your own master, 
                and<br>
                I will give you the whole world and a new pair of skates.&quot; 
                But he<br>
                could not accomplish it.<br>
                &quot;Now I must hasten away to warmer countries,&quot; said the 
                Snow Queen.<br>
                &quot;I will go and look into the black craters of the tops of 
                the<br>
                burning mountains, Etna and Vesuvius, as they are called,- I shall<br>
                make them look white, which will be good for them, and for the<br>
                lemons and the grapes.&quot; And away flew the Snow Queen, leaving 
                little<br>
                Kay quite alone in the great hall which was so many miles in length;<br>
                so he sat and looked at his pieces of ice, and was thinking so 
                deeply,<br>
                and sat so still, that any one might have supposed he was frozen.<br>
                Just at this moment it happened that little Gerda came through 
                the<br>
                great door of the castle. Cutting winds were raging around her, 
                but<br>
                she offered up a prayer and the winds sank down as if they were<br>
                going to sleep; and she went on till she came to the large empty 
                hall,<br>
                and caught sight of Kay; she knew him directly; she flew to him 
                and<br>
                threw her arms round his neck, and held him fast, while she exclaimed,<br>
                &quot;Kay, dear little Kay, I have found you at last.&quot;<br>
                But he sat quite still, stiff and cold.<br>
                Then little Gerda wept hot tears, which fell on his breast, and<br>
                penetrated into his heart, and thawed the lump of ice, and washed 
                away<br>
                the little piece of glass which had stuck there. Then he looked 
                at<br>
                her, and she sang-</p>
              <p> &quot;Roses bloom and cease to be,<br>
                But we shall the Christ-child see.&quot;</p>
              <p> Then Kay burst into tears, and he wept so that the splinter 
                of<br>
                glass swam out of his eye. Then he recognized Gerda, and said,<br>
                joyfully, &quot;Gerda, dear little Gerda, where have you been 
                all this<br>
                time, and where have I been?&quot; And he looked all around him, 
                and<br>
                said, &quot;How cold it is, and how large and empty it all looks,&quot; 
                and he<br>
                clung to Gerda, and she laughed and wept for joy. It was so pleasing<br>
                to see them that the pieces of ice even danced about; and when 
                they<br>
                were tired and went to lie down, they formed themselves into the<br>
                letters of the word which the Snow Queen had said he must find 
                out<br>
                before he could be his own master, and have the whole world and 
                a pair of new skates. Then Gerda kissed his cheeks, and they became 
                blooming; and she kissed his eyes, and they shone like her own; 
                she kissed his hands and his feet, and then he became quite healthy 
                and cheerful. The Snow Queen might come home now when she pleased, 
                for there stood his certainty of freedom, in the word she wanted, 
                written in shining letters of ice.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then they took each other by the hand, and went forth from the<br>
                great palace of ice. They spoke of the grandmother, and of the 
                roses<br>
                on the roof, and as they went on the winds were at rest, and the 
                sun<br>
                burst forth. When they arrived at the bush with red berries, there<br>
                stood the reindeer waiting for them, and he had brought another<br>
                young reindeer with him, whose udders were full, and the children<br>
                drank her warm milk and kissed her on the mouth. Then they carried 
                Kay and Gerda first to the Finland woman, where they warmed themselves 
                thoroughly in the hot room, and she gave them directions about 
                their journey home. Next they went to the Lapland woman, who had 
                made some new clothes for them, and put their sleighs in order. 
                Both the reindeer ran by their side, and followed them as far 
                as the boundaries of the country, here the first green leaves 
                were budding. And here they took leave of the two reindeer and 
                the Lapland woman, and all said- Farewell. Then the birds began 
                to twitter, and the forest too was full of green young leaves; 
                and out of it came a beautiful<br>
                horse, which Gerda remembered, for it was one which had drawn 
                the<br>
                golden coach. A young girl was riding upon it, with a shining 
                red<br>
                cap on her head, and pistols in her belt. It was the little<br>
                robber-maiden, who had got tired of staying at home; she was going<br>
                first to the north, and if that did not suit her, she meant to 
                try<br>
                some other part of the world. She knew Gerda directly, and Gerda<br>
                remembered her: it was a joyful meeting.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are a fine fellow to go gadding about in this way,&quot; 
                said<br>
                she to little Kay, &quot;I should like to know whether you deserve 
                that any<br>
                one should go to the end of the world to find you.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But Gerda patted her cheeks, and asked after the prince and<br>
                princess.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;They are gone to foreign countries,&quot; said the robber-girl.<br>
                &quot;And the crow?&quot; asked Gerda.<br>
                &quot;Oh, the crow is dead,&quot; she replied; &quot;his tame 
                sweetheart is now a<br>
                widow, and wears a bit of black worsted round her leg. She mourns 
                very pitifully, but it is all stuff. But now tell me how you managed 
                to get him back.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then Gerda and Kay told her all about it. &quot;Snip, snap, snare! 
                it's all right at last,&quot; said the robber-girl.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then she took both their hands, and promised that if ever she<br>
                should pass through the town, she would call and pay them a visit. 
                And then she rode away into the wide world. But Gerda and Kay 
                went hand-in-hand towards home; and as they advanced, spring appeared 
                more lovely with its green verdure and its beautiful flowers. 
              </p>
              <p>Very soon they recognized the large town where they lived, and 
                the tall steeples of the churches, in which the sweet bells were 
                ringing a<br>
                merry peal as they entered it, and found their way to their<br>
                grandmother's door. They went upstairs into the little room, where 
                all<br>
                looked just as it used to do. The old clock was going &quot;tick, 
                tick,&quot;<br>
                and the hands pointed to the time of day, but as they passed through<br>
                the door into the room they perceived that they were both grown 
                up,<br>
                and become a man and woman. The roses out on the roof were in 
                full<br>
                bloom, and peeped in at the window; and there stood the little 
                chairs,<br>
                on which they had sat when children; and Kay and Gerda seated<br>
                themselves each on their own chair, and held each other by the 
                hand,<br>
                while the cold empty grandeur of the Snow Queen's palace vanished 
                from their memories like a painful dream. The grandmother sat 
                in God's bright sunshine, and she read aloud from the Bible, &quot;Except 
                ye<br>
                become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the<br>
                kingdom of God.&quot; And Kay and Gerda looked into each other's 
                eyes,<br>
                and all at once understood the words of the old song,</p>
              <p> &quot;Roses bloom and cease to be,<br>
                But we shall the Christ-child see.&quot;</p>
              <p>And they both sat there, grown up, yet children at heart; and 
                it was<br>
                summer,- warm, beautiful summer.</p>

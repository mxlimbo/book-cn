              <p  align="center"> FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</p>
              <p class="h" align="center"> THE OLD HOUSE</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> A VERY old house stood once in a street with several that were<br>
                quite new and clean. The date of its erection had been carved 
                on one<br>
                of the beams, and surrounded by scrolls formed of tulips and<br>
                hop-tendrils; by this date it could be seen that the old house 
                was<br>
                nearly three hundred years old. Verses too were written over the<br>
                windows in old-fashioned letters, and grotesque faces, curiously<br>
                carved, grinned at you from under the cornices. One story projected<br>
                a long way over the other, and under the roof ran a leaden gutter,<br>
                with a dragon's head at the end. The rain was intended to pour 
                out<br>
                at the dragon's mouth, but it ran out of his body instead, for 
                there<br>
                was a hole in the gutter. The other houses in the street were 
                new<br>
                and well built, with large window panes and smooth walls. Any 
                one<br>
                could see they had nothing to do with the old house. Perhaps they<br>
                thought, &quot;How long will that heap of rubbish remain here 
                to be a<br>
                disgrace to the whole street. The parapet projects so far forward 
                that<br>
                no one can see out of our windows what is going on in that<br>
                direction. The stairs are as broad as the staircase of a castle, 
                and<br>
                as steep as if they led to a church-tower. The iron railing looks 
                like<br>
                the gate of a cemetery, and there are brass knobs upon it. It 
                is<br>
                really too ridiculous.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Opposite to the old house were more nice new houses, which had<br>
                just the same opinion as their neighbors.<br>
              </p>
              <p>At the window of one of them sat a little boy with fresh rosy<br>
                cheeks, and clear sparkling eyes, who was very fond of the old<br>
                house, in sunshine or in moonlight. He would sit and look at the<br>
                wall from which the plaster had in some places fallen off, and 
                fancy<br>
                all sorts of scenes which had been in former times. How the street<br>
                must have looked when the houses had all gable roofs, open staircases, 
                and gutters with dragons at the spout. He could even see soldiers 
                walking about with halberds. Certainly it was a very good house 
                to look at for amusement.<br>
              </p>
              <p>An old man lived in it, who wore knee-breeches, a coat with<br>
                large brass buttons, and a wig, which any one could see was a 
                real<br>
                wig. Every morning an old man came to clean the rooms, and to 
                wait<br>
                upon him, otherwise the old man in the knee-breeches would have 
                been quite alone in the house. Sometimes he came to one of the 
                windows and looked out; then the little boy nodded to him, and 
                the old man nodded back again, till they became acquainted, and 
                were friends, although they had never spoken to each other; but 
                that was of no consequence.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The little boy one day heard his parents say, &quot;The old man<br>
                opposite is very well off, but is terribly lonely.&quot; The next 
                Sunday<br>
                morning the little boy wrapped something in a piece of paper and<br>
                took it to the door of the old house, and said to the attendant 
                who<br>
                waited upon the old man, &quot;Will you please give this from 
                me to the<br>
                gentleman who lives here; I have two tin soldiers, and this is 
                one<br>
                of them, and he shall have it, because I know he is terribly lonely.&quot;<br>
                And the old attendant nodded and looked very pleased, and then<br>
                he carried the tin soldier into the house.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Afterwards he was sent over to ask the little boy if he would<br>
                not like to pay a visit himself. His parents gave him permission,<br>
                and so it was that he gained admission to the old house.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The brassy knobs on the railings shone more brightly than ever, 
                as<br>
                if they had been polished on account of his visit; and on the 
                door<br>
                were carved trumpeters standing in tulips, and it seemed as if 
                they<br>
                were blowing with all their might, their cheeks were so puffed 
                out.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Tanta-ra-ra, the little boy is coming; Tanta-ra-ra, the 
                little boy is<br>
                coming.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the door opened. All round the hall hung old portraits of<br>
                knights in armor, and ladies in silk gowns; and the armor rattled, 
                and<br>
                the silk dresses rustled. Then came a staircase which went up 
                a long<br>
                way, and then came down a little way and led to a balcony, which 
                was in a very ruinous state. There were large holes and long cracks, 
                out of which grew grass and leaves, indeed the whole balcony, 
                the<br>
                courtyard, and the walls were so overgrown with green that they 
                looked like a garden. In the balcony stood flower-pots, on which 
                were heads having asses' ears, but the flowers in them grew just 
                as they pleased.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In one pot pinks were growing all over the sides, at least the 
                green<br>
                leaves were shooting forth stalk and stem, and saying as plainly 
                as<br>
                they could speak, &quot;The air has fanned me, the sun has kissed 
                me, and I am promised a little flower for next Sunday- really 
                for next Sunday.&quot;<br>
                Then they entered a room in which the walls were covered with<br>
                leather, and the leather had golden flowers stamped upon it.</p>
              <p> &quot;Gilding will fade in damp weather,<br>
                To endure, there is nothing like leather,&quot;</p>
              <p>said the walls. Chairs handsomely carved, with elbows on each 
                side,<br>
                and with very high backs, stood in the room, and as they creaked<br>
                they seemed to say, &quot;Sit down. Oh dear, how I am creaking. 
                I shall<br>
                certainly have the gout like the old cupboard. Gout in my back, 
                ugh.&quot;<br>
                And then the little boy entered the room where the old man sat.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thank you for the tin soldier my little friend,&quot; said 
                the old<br>
                man, &quot;and thank you also for coming to see me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thanks, thanks,&quot; or &quot;Creak, creak,&quot; said 
                all the furniture.<br>
                There was so much that the pieces of furniture stood in each<br>
                other's way to get a sight of the little boy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On the wall near the centre of the room hung the picture of a<br>
                beautiful lady, young and gay, dressed in the fashion of the olden<br>
                times, with powdered hair, and a full, stiff skirt. She said neither<br>
                &quot;thanks&quot; nor &quot;creak,&quot; but she looked down 
                upon the little boy with her mild eyes; and then he said to the 
                old man,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Where did you get that picture?&quot;<br>
                &quot;From the shop opposite,&quot; he replied. &quot;Many portraits 
                hang there<br>
                that none seem to trouble themselves about. The persons they represent 
                have been dead and buried long since. But I knew this lady many 
                years ago, and she has been dead nearly half a century.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Under a glass beneath the picture hung a nosegay of withered<br>
                flowers, which were no doubt half a century old too, at least 
                they<br>
                appeared so.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the pendulum of the old clock went to and fro, and the hands<br>
                turned round; and as time passed on, everything in the room grew<br>
                older, but no one seemed to notice it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;They say at home,&quot; said the little boy, &quot;that 
                you are very<br>
                lonely.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; replied the old man, &quot;I have pleasant thoughts 
                of all that<br>
                has passed, recalled by memory; and now you are come to visit 
                me,<br>
                and that is very pleasant.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then he took from the book-case, a book full of pictures<br>
                representing long processions of wonderful coaches, such as are<br>
                never seen at the present time. Soldiers like the knave of clubs,<br>
                and citizens with waving banners. The tailors had a flag with 
                a pair<br>
                of scissors supported by two lions, and on the shoemakers' flag<br>
                there were not boots, but an eagle with two heads, for the<br>
                shoemakers must have everything arranged so that they can say, 
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This is a pair.&quot; What a picture-book it was; and then 
                the old man went into another room to fetch apples and nuts. It 
                was very pleasant,<br>
                certainly, to be in that old house.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I cannot endure it,&quot; said the tin soldier, who stood 
                on a<br>
                shelf, &quot;it is so lonely and dull here. I have been accustomed 
                to<br>
                live in a family, and I cannot get used to this life. I cannot 
                bear<br>
                it. The whole day is long enough, but the evening is longer. It 
                is not<br>
                here like it was in your house opposite, when your father and 
                mother<br>
                talked so cheerfully together, while you and all the dear children<br>
                made such a delightful noise. No, it is all lonely in the old 
                man's<br>
                house. Do you think he gets any kisses? Do you think he ever has<br>
                friendly looks, or a Christmas tree? He will have nothing now 
                but<br>
                the grave. Oh, I cannot bear it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You must not look only on the sorrowful side,&quot; said 
                the little<br>
                boy; &quot;I think everything in this house is beautiful, and 
                all the old<br>
                pleasant thoughts come back here to pay visits.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah, but I never see any, and I don't know them,&quot; said 
                the tin<br>
                soldier, &quot;and I cannot bear it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You must bear it,&quot; said the little boy. Then the old 
                man came<br>
                back with a pleasant face; and brought with him beautiful preserved<br>
                fruits, as well as apples and nuts; and the little boy thought 
                no more<br>
                of the tin soldier. How happy and delighted the little boy was; 
                and<br>
                after he returned home, and while days and weeks passed, a great<br>
                deal of nodding took place from one house to the other, and then 
                the<br>
                little boy went to pay another visit. The carved trumpeters blew<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Tanta-ra-ra. There is the little boy. Tanta-ra-ra.&quot; 
                The swords and<br>
                armor on the old knight's pictures rattled. The silk dresses<br>
                rustled, the leather repeated its rhyme, and the old chairs had 
                the<br>
                gout in their backs, and cried, &quot;Creak;&quot; it was all 
                exactly like the<br>
                first time; for in that house, one day and one hour were just 
                like<br>
                another. &quot;I cannot bear it any longer,&quot; said the tin 
                soldier; &quot;I<br>
                have wept tears of tin, it is so melancholy here. Let me go to 
                the<br>
                wars, and lose an arm or a leg, that would be some change; I cannot<br>
                bear it. Now I know what it is to have visits from one's old<br>
                recollections, and all they bring with them. I have had visits 
                from<br>
                mine, and you may believe me it is not altogether pleasant. I 
                was very<br>
                nearly jumping from the shelf. I saw you all in your house opposite,<br>
                as if you were really present. It was Sunday morning, and you 
                children stood round the table, singing the hymn that you sing 
                every morning.<br>
              </p>
              <p>You were standing quietly, with your hands folded, and your father 
                and mother. You were standing quietly, with your hands folded, 
                and your father and mother were looking just as serious, when 
                the door<br>
                opened, and your little sister Maria, who is not two years old, 
                was<br>
                brought into the room. You know she always dances when she hears 
                music and singing of any sort; so she began to dance immediately, 
                although she ought not to have done so, but she could not get 
                into the right time because the tune was so slow; so she stood 
                first on one leg and then on the other, and bent her head very 
                low, but it would not suit the music. You all stood looking very 
                grave, although it was very<br>
                difficult to do so, but I laughed so to myself that I fell down 
                from<br>
                the table, and got a bruise, which is there still; I know it was 
                not<br>
                right to laugh. So all this, and everything else that I have seen,<br>
                keeps running in my head, and these must be the old recollections 
                that<br>
                bring so many thoughts with them. Tell me whether you still sing 
                on<br>
                Sundays, and tell me about your little sister Maria, and how my 
                old<br>
                comrade is, the other tin soldier. Ah, really he must be very 
                happy; I<br>
                cannot endure this life.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are given away,&quot; said the little boy; &quot;you 
                must stay. Don't<br>
                you see that?&quot; Then the old man came in, with a box containing 
                many<br>
                curious things to show him. Rouge-pots, scent-boxes, and old cards, 
                so large and so richly gilded, that none are ever seen like them 
                in these<br>
                days. And there were smaller boxes to look at, and the piano was<br>
                opened, and inside the lid were painted landscapes. But when the 
                old<br>
                man played, the piano sounded quite out of tune. Then he looked 
                at the picture he had bought at the broker's, and his eyes sparkled<br>
                brightly as he nodded at it, and said, &quot;Ah, she could sing 
                that tune.&quot;<br>
                &quot;I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!&quot; cried 
                the tin<br>
                soldier as loud as he could, and threw himself down on the floor.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Where could he have fallen? The old man searched, and the little 
                boy<br>
                searched, but he was gone, and could not be found. &quot;I shall 
                find him<br>
                again,&quot; said the old man, but he did not find him. The boards 
                of the<br>
                floor were open and full of holes. The tin soldier had fallen<br>
                through a crack between the boards, and lay there now in an open<br>
                grave. The day went by, and the little boy returned home; the 
                week<br>
                passed, and many more weeks. It was winter, and the windows were 
                quite frozen, so the little boy was obliged to breathe on the 
                panes, and rub a hole to peep through at the old house. Snow drifts 
                were lying in all the scrolls and on the inscriptions, and the 
                steps were covered with snow as if no one were at home. And indeed 
                nobody was home, for the old man was dead. In the evening, a hearse 
                stopped at the door, and the old man in his coffin was placed 
                in it. He was to be taken to the country to be buried there in 
                his own grave; so they carried him away; no one followed him, 
                for all his friends were dead; and the little boy kissed his hand 
                to the coffin as the hearse moved away with it. A few days after, 
                there was an auction at the old house, and from his window the 
                little boy saw the people carrying away the pictures of old knights 
                and ladies, the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, 
                and the cup-boards. Some were taken one way, some another. Her 
                portrait, which had been bought at the picture<br>
                dealer's, went back again to his shop, and there it remained, 
                for no<br>
                one seemed to know her, or to care for the old picture. In the 
                spring;<br>
                they began to pull the house itself down; people called it complete<br>
                rubbish. From the street could be seen the room in which the walls<br>
                were covered with leather, ragged and torn, and the green in the<br>
                balcony hung straggling over the beams; they pulled it down quickly,<br>
                for it looked ready to fall, and at last it was cleared away<br>
                altogether. &quot;What a good riddance,&quot; said the neighbors' 
                houses. Very<br>
                shortly, a fine new house was built farther back from the road; 
                it had<br>
                lofty windows and smooth walls, but in front, on the spot where 
                the<br>
                old house really stood, a little garden was planted, and wild 
                vines<br>
                grew up over the neighboring walls; in front of the garden were<br>
                large iron railings and a great gate, which looked very stately.<br>
                People used to stop and peep through the railings. The sparrows<br>
                assembled in dozens upon the wild vines, and chattered all together 
                as<br>
                loud as they could, but not about the old house; none of them 
                could<br>
                remember it, for many years had passed by, so many indeed, that 
                the<br>
                little boy was now a man, and a really good man too, and his parents<br>
                were very proud of him. He was just married, and had come, with 
                his<br>
                young wife, to reside in the new house with the garden in front 
                of it,<br>
                and now he stood there by her side while she planted a field flower<br>
                that she thought very pretty. She was planting it herself with 
                her<br>
                little hands, and pressing down the earth with her fingers. &quot;Oh<br>
                dear, what was that?&quot; she exclaimed, as something pricked 
                her. Out<br>
                of the soft earth something was sticking up. It was- only think!- 
                it<br>
                was really the tin soldier, the very same which had been lost 
                up in<br>
                the old man's room, and had been hidden among old wood and rubbish 
                for a long time, till it sunk into the earth, where it must have 
                been for many years. And the young wife wiped the soldier, first 
                with a green leaf, and then with her fine pocket-handkerchief, 
                that smelt<br>
                of such beautiful perfume. And the tin soldier felt as if he was<br>
                recovering from a fainting fit. &quot;Let me see him,&quot; said 
                the young<br>
                man, and then he smiled and shook his head, and said, &quot;It 
                can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of something that 
                happened to one of my tin soldiers when I was a little boy.&quot; 
                And then he told his wife about the old house and the old man, 
                and of the tin soldier which he had sent across, because he thought 
                the old man was lonely; and he related the story so clearly that 
                tears came into the eyes of the young wife for the old house and 
                the old man. &quot;It is very likely that this is really the same 
                soldier,&quot; said she, and I will take care of him, and always 
                remember what you have told me; but some day you must show me 
                the old man's grave.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I don't know where it is,&quot; he replied; &quot;no one 
                knows. All his<br>
                friends are dead; no one took care of him, and I was only a little<br>
                boy.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, how dreadfully lonely he must have been,&quot; said 
                she.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, terribly lonely,&quot; cried the tin soldier; &quot;still 
                it is<br>
                delightful not to be forgotten.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Delightful indeed,&quot; cried a voice quite near to them; 
                no one<br>
                but the tin soldier saw that it came from a rag of the leather 
                which<br>
                hung in tatters; it had lost all its gilding, and looked like 
                wet<br>
                earth, but it had an opinion, and it spoke it thus:-</p>
              <p> &quot;Gilding will fade in damp weather,<br>
                To endure, there is nothing like leather.&quot;</p>
              <p> But the tin soldier did not believe any such thing.</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> THE BELL</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IN the narrow streets of a large town people often heard in 
                the<br>
                evening, when the sun was setting, and his last rays gave a golden<br>
                tint to the chimney-pots, a strange noise which resembled the 
                sound of a church bell; it only lasted an instant, for it was 
                lost in the<br>
                continual roar of traffic and hum of voices which rose from the<br>
                town. &quot;The evening bell is ringing,&quot; people used to 
                say; &quot;the sun is<br>
                setting!&quot; Those who walked outside the town, where the houses 
                were<br>
                less crowded and interspersed by gardens and little fields, saw 
                the<br>
                evening sky much better, and heard the sound of the bell much 
                more<br>
                clearly. It seemed as though the sound came from a church, deep 
                in the calm, fragrant wood, and thither people looked with devout 
                feelings.<br>
              </p>
              <p>A considerable time elapsed: one said to the other, &quot;I really<br>
                wonder if there is a church out in the wood. The bell has indeed 
                a<br>
                strange sweet sound! Shall we go there and see what the cause 
                of it<br>
                is?&quot; The rich drove, the poor walked, but the way seemed 
                to them<br>
                extraordinarily long, and when they arrived at a number of willow<br>
                trees on the border of the wood they sat down, looked up into 
                the<br>
                great branches and thought they were now really in the wood. A<br>
                confectioner from the town also came out and put up a stall there;<br>
                then came another confectioner who hung a bell over his stall, 
                which<br>
                was covered with pitch to protect it from the rain, but the clapper<br>
                was wanting.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When people came home they used to say that it had been very<br>
                romantic, and that really means something else than merely taking 
                tea.<br>
                Three persons declared that they had gone as far as the end of 
                the<br>
                wood; they had always heard the strange sound, but there it seemed<br>
                to them as if it came from the town. One of them wrote verses 
                about<br>
                the bell, and said that it was like the voice of a mother speaking<br>
                to an intelligent and beloved child; no tune, he said, was sweeter<br>
                than the sound of the bell.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The emperor of the country heard of it, and declared that he 
                who<br>
                would really find out where the sound came from should receive 
                the<br>
                title of &quot;Bellringer to the World,&quot; even if there was 
                no bell at all.<br>
                Now many went out into the wood for the sake of this splendid<br>
                berth; but only one of them came back with some sort of explanation.<br>
                None of them had gone far enough, nor had he, and yet he said 
                that the sound of the bell came from a large owl in a hollow tree. 
                It was a<br>
                wisdom owl, which continually knocked its head against the tree, 
                but<br>
                he was unable to say with certainty whether its head or the hollow<br>
                trunk of the tree was the cause of the noise.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He was appointed &quot;Bellringer to the World,&quot; and wrote 
                every year a<br>
                short dissertation on the owl, but by this means people did not 
                become any wiser than they had been before.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was just confirmation-day. The clergyman had delivered a<br>
                beautiful and touching sermon, the candidates were deeply moved 
                by it; it was indeed a very important day for them; they were 
                all at once<br>
                transformed from mere children to grown-up people; the childish 
                soul<br>
                was to fly over, as it were, into a more reasonable being.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The sun shone most brightly; and the sound of the great unknown<br>
                bell was heard more distinctly than ever. They had a mind to go<br>
                thither, all except three. One of them wished to go home and try 
                on<br>
                her ball dress, for this very dress and the ball were the cause 
                of her<br>
                being confirmed this time, otherwise she would not have been allowed<br>
                to go. The second, a poor boy, had borrowed a coat and a pair 
                of boots from the son of his landlord to be confirmed in, and 
                he had to<br>
                return them at a certain time. The third said that he never went<br>
                into strange places if his parents were not with him; he had always<br>
                been a good child, and wished to remain so, even after being<br>
                confirmed, and they ought not to tease him for this; they, however,<br>
                did it all the same. These three, therefore did not go; the others<br>
                went on. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and the<br>
                confirmed children sang too, holding each other by the hand, for<br>
                they had no position yet, and they were all equal in the eyes 
                of<br>
                God. Two of the smallest soon became tired and returned to the 
                town; two little girls sat down and made garlands of flowers, 
                they,<br>
                therefore, did not go on. When the others arrived at the willow 
                trees,<br>
                where the confectioner had put up his stall, they said: &quot;Now 
                we are<br>
                out here; the bell does not in reality exist- it is only something<br>
                that people imagine!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then suddenly the sound of the bell was heard so beautifully 
                and<br>
                solemnly from the wood that four or five made up their minds to 
                go<br>
                still further on. The wood was very thickly grown. It was difficult 
                to<br>
                advance: wood lilies and anemones grew almost too high; flowering<br>
                convolvuli and brambles were hanging like garlands from tree to<br>
                tree; while the nightingales were singing and the sunbeams played.<br>
                That was very beautiful! But the way was unfit for the girls; 
                they<br>
                would have torn their dresses. Large rocks, covered with moss 
                of<br>
                various hues, were lying about; the fresh spring water rippled 
                forth<br>
                with a peculiar sound. &quot;I don't think that can be the bell,&quot; 
                said<br>
                one of the confirmed children, and then he lay down and listened.<br>
                &quot;We must try to find out if it is!&quot; And there he remained, 
                and let the<br>
                others walk on.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They came to a hut built of the bark of trees and branches; a<br>
                large crab-apple tree spread its branches over it, as if it intended<br>
                to pour all its fruit on the roof, upon which roses were blooming; 
                the<br>
                long boughs covered the gable, where a little bell was hanging. 
                Was<br>
                this the one they had heard? All agreed that it must be so, except 
                one<br>
                who said that the bell was too small and too thin to be heard 
                at<br>
                such a distance, and that it had quite a different sound to that 
                which<br>
                had so touched men's hearts.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He who spoke was a king's son, and therefore the others said<br>
                that such a one always wishes to be cleverer than other people.<br>
                Therefore they let him go alone; and as he walked on, the solitude<br>
                of the wood produced a feeling of reverence in his breast; but 
                still<br>
                he heard the little bell about which the others rejoiced, and<br>
                sometimes, when the wind blew in that direction, he could hear 
                the<br>
                sounds from the confectioner's stall, where the others were singing 
                at<br>
                tea. But the deep sounds of the bell were much stronger; soon 
                it<br>
                seemed to him as if an organ played an accompaniment- the sound 
                came from the left, from the side where the heart is. Now something 
                rustled among the bushes, and a little boy stood before the king's 
                son, in wooden shoes and such a short jacket that the sleeves 
                did not reach to his wrists. They knew each other: the boy was 
                the one who had not been able to go with them because he had to 
                take the coat and boots back to his landlord's son. That he had 
                done, and had started again in his wooden shoes and old clothes, 
                for the sound of the bell was too enticing- he felt he must go 
                on.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We might go together,&quot; said the king's son. But the 
                poor boy with<br>
                the wooden shoes was quite ashamed; he pulled at the short sleeves<br>
                of his jacket, and said that he was afraid he could not walk so<br>
                fast; besides, he was of opinion that the bell ought to be sought 
                at<br>
                the right, for there was all that was grand and magnificent.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Then we shall not meet,&quot; said the king's son, nodding 
                to the poor<br>
                boy, who went into the deepest part of the wood, where the thorns 
                tore his shabby clothes and scratched his hands, face, and feet 
                until<br>
                they bled. The king's son also received several good scratches, 
                but<br>
                the sun was shining on his way, and it is he whom we will now<br>
                follow, for he was a quick fellow. &quot;I will and must find 
                the bell,&quot; he<br>
                said, &quot;if I have to go to the end of the world.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Ugly monkeys sat high in the branches and clenched their teeth.<br>
                &quot;Shall we beat him?&quot; they said. &quot;Shall we thrash 
                him? He is a king's<br>
                son!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But he walked on undaunted, deeper and deeper into the wood, 
                where<br>
                the most wonderful flowers were growing; there were standing white<br>
                star lilies with blood-red stamens, sky-blue tulips shining when 
                the<br>
                wind moved them; apple-trees covered with apples like large glittering<br>
                soap bubbles: only think how resplendent these trees were in the<br>
                sunshine! All around were beautiful green meadows, where hart 
                and hind played in the grass. There grew magnificent oaks and 
                beech-trees; and if the bark was split of any of them, long blades 
                of grass grew out of the clefts; there were also large smooth 
                lakes in the wood,<br>
                on which the swans were swimming about and flapping their wings. 
              </p>
              <p>The king's son often stood still and listened; sometimes he thought 
                that the sound of the bell rose up to him out of one of these 
                deep lakes, but soon he found that this was a mistake, and that 
                the bell was<br>
                ringing still farther in the wood. Then the sun set, the clouds 
                were<br>
                as red as fire; it became quiet in the wood; he sank down on his<br>
                knees, sang an evening hymn and said: &quot;I shall never find 
                what I am<br>
                looking for! Now the sun is setting, and the night, the dark night, 
                is<br>
                approaching. Yet I may perhaps see the round sun once more before 
                he disappears beneath the horizon. I will climb up these rocks, 
                they<br>
                are as high as the highest trees!&quot; And then, taking hold 
                of the<br>
                creepers and roots, he climbed up on the wet stones, where<br>
                water-snakes were wriggling and the toads, as it were, barked 
                at<br>
                him: he reached the top before the sun, seen from such a height, 
                had<br>
                quite set. &quot;Oh, what a splendour!&quot; The sea, the great 
                majestic sea,<br>
                which was rolling its long waves against the shore, stretched 
                out<br>
                before him, and the sun was standing like a large bright altar 
                and<br>
                there where sea and heaven met- all melted together in the most<br>
                glowing colours; the wood was singing, and his heart too. The 
                whole of nature was one large holy church, in which the trees 
                and hovering<br>
                clouds formed the pillars, the flowers and grass the woven velvet<br>
                carpet, and heaven itself was the great cupola; up there the flame<br>
                colour vanished as soon as the sun disappeared, but millions of<br>
                stars were lighted; diamond lamps were shining, and the king's 
                son<br>
                stretched his arms out towards heaven, towards the sea, and towards<br>
                the wood. Then suddenly the poor boy with the short-sleeved jacket 
                and the wooden shoes appeared; he had arrived just as quickly 
                on the<br>
                road he had chosen. And they ran towards each other and took one<br>
                another's hand, in the great cathedral of nature and poesy, and<br>
                above them sounded the invisible holy bell; happy spirits surrounded<br>
                them, singing hallelujahs and rejoicing.</p>

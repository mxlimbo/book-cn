              <p class="h" align="center"> THE MONEY-BOX</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IN a nursery where a number of toys lay scattered about, a<br>
                money-box stood on the top of a very high wardrobe. It was made 
                of<br>
                clay in the shape of a pig, and had been bought of the potter. 
                In<br>
                the back of the pig was a slit, and this slit had been enlarged 
                with a<br>
                knife, so that dollars, or crown pieces, might slip through; and,<br>
                indeed there were two in the box, besides a number of pence. The<br>
                money-pig was stuffed so full that it could no longer rattle, 
                which is<br>
                the highest state of perfection to which a money-pig can attain. 
                There<br>
                he stood upon the cupboard, high and lofty, looking down upon<br>
                everything else in the room. He knew very well that he had enough<br>
                inside him to buy up all the other toys, and this gave him a very 
                good<br>
                opinion of his own value. The rest thought of this fact also, 
                although<br>
                they did not express it, for there were so many other things to 
                talk<br>
                about. A large doll, still handsome, though rather old, for her 
                neck<br>
                had been mended, lay inside one of the drawers which was partly<br>
                open. She called out to the others, &quot;Let us have a game at 
                being men<br>
                and women, that is something worth playing at.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Upon this there was a great uproar; even the engravings, which<br>
                hung in frames on the wall, turned round in their excitement, 
                and<br>
                showed that they had a wrong side to them, although they had not 
                the<br>
                least intention to expose themselves in this way, or to object 
                to<br>
                the game. It was late at night, but as the moon shone through 
                the<br>
                windows, they had light at a cheap rate. And as the game was now 
                to<br>
                begin, all were invited to take part in it, even the children's 
                wagon,<br>
                which certainly belonged to the coarser playthings. &quot;Each 
                has its<br>
                own value,&quot; said the wagon; &quot;we cannot all be noblemen; 
                there must<br>
                be some to do the work.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The money-pig was the only one who received a written<br>
                invitation. He stood so high that they were afraid he would not 
                accept<br>
                a verbal message. But in his reply, he said, if he had to take 
                a part,<br>
                he must enjoy the sport from his own home; they were to arrange 
                for<br>
                him to do so; and so they did. The little toy theatre was therefore<br>
                put up in such a way that the money-pig could look directly into 
                it.<br>
                Some wanted to begin with a comedy, and afterwards to have a tea 
                party and a discussion for mental improvement, but they commenced 
                with the latter first. The rocking-horse spoke of training and 
                races; the wagon of railways and steam power, for these subjects 
                belonged to each of their professions, and it was right they should 
                talk of them. </p>
              <p>The clock talked politics- &quot;tick, tick;&quot; he professed 
                to know what was the time of day, but there was a whisper that 
                he did not go correctly. The bamboo cane stood by, looking stiff 
                and proud: he was vain of his brass ferrule and silver top, and 
                on the sofa lay two worked cushions, pretty but stupid. When the 
                play at the little theatre began, the rest sat and looked on; 
                they were requested to applaud and stamp, or crack, when they 
                felt gratified with what they saw. But the riding-whip said he 
                never cracked for old people, only for the young who were not 
                yet married. &quot;I crack for everybody,&quot; said the cracker.<br>
                &quot;Yes, and a fine noise you make,&quot; thought the audience, 
                as the<br>
                play went on.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was not worth much, but it was very well played, and all the<br>
                characters turned their painted sides to the audience, for they 
                were<br>
                made only to be seen on one side. The acting was wonderful,<br>
                excepting that sometimes they came out beyond the lamps, because 
                the wires were a little too long. The doll, whose neck had been 
                darned, was so excited that the place in her neck burst, and the 
                money-pig declared he must do something for one of the players, 
                as they had all pleased him so much. So he made up his mind to 
                remember one of them in his will, as the one to be buried with 
                him in the family vault, whenever that event should happen. They 
                all enjoyed the comedy so much, that they gave up all thoughts 
                of the tea party, and only carried out their idea of intellectual 
                amusement, which they<br>
                called playing at men and women; and there was nothing wrong about 
                it, for it was only play. All the while, each one thought most 
                of himself, or of what the money-pig could be thinking. His thoughts 
                were on, as he supposed, a very distant time- of making his will, 
                and of his burial, and of when it might all come to pass. Certainly 
                sooner than he expected- for all at once down he came from the 
                top of the press, fell on the ground, and was broken to pieces. 
                Then the pennies<br>
                hopped and danced about in the most amusing manner. The little 
                ones twirled round like tops, and the large ones rolled away as 
                far as they could, especially the one great silver crown piece 
                who had often to go out into the world, and now he had his wish 
                as well as all the rest of the money. The pieces of the money-pig 
                were thrown into the<br>
                dust-bin, and the next day there stood a new money-pig on the<br>
                cupboard, but it had not a farthing in its inside yet, and<br>
                therefore, like the old one, it could not rattle. This was the<br>
                beginning with him, and we will make it the end of our story.</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> THE ELFIN HILL</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> A FEW large lizards were running nimbly about in the clefts 
                of<br>
                an old tree; they could understand one another very well, for 
                they<br>
                spoke the lizard language.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin hill,&quot; 
                said<br>
                one of the lizards; &quot;I have not been able to close my eyes 
                for two<br>
                nights on account of the noise; I might just as well have had 
                the<br>
                toothache, for that always keeps me awake.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There is something going on within there,&quot; said the 
                other lizard;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;they propped up the top of the hill with four red posts, 
                till<br>
                cock-crow this morning, so that it is thoroughly aired, and the<br>
                elfin girls have learnt new dances; there is something.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I spoke about it to an earth-worm of my acquaintance,&quot; 
                said a<br>
                third lizard; &quot;the earth-worm had just come from the elfin 
                hill, where<br>
                he has been groping about in the earth day and night. He has heard 
                a<br>
                great deal; although he cannot see, poor miserable creature, yet 
                he<br>
                understands very well how to wriggle and lurk about. They expect<br>
                friends in the elfin hill, grand company, too; but who they are 
                the<br>
                earth-worm would not say, or, perhaps, he really did not know. 
                All the will-o'-the-wisps are ordered to be there to hold a torch 
                dance, as it is called. The silver and gold which is plentiful 
                in the hill will<br>
                be polished and placed out in the moonlight.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Who can the strangers be?&quot; asked the lizards; &quot;what 
                can the<br>
                matter be? Hark, what a buzzing and humming there is!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Just at this moment the elfin hill opened, and an old elfin<br>
                maiden, hollow behind, came tripping out; she was the old elf 
                king's<br>
                housekeeper, and a distant relative of the family; therefore she<br>
                wore an amber heart on the middle of her forehead. Her feet moved 
                very fast, &quot;trip, trip;&quot; good gracious, how she could 
                trip right down to the sea to the night-raven.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are invited to the elf hill for this evening,&quot; 
                said she; &quot;but<br>
                will you do me a great favor and undertake the invitations? you<br>
                ought to do something, for you have no housekeeping to attend 
                to as<br>
                I have. We are going to have some very grand people, conjurors, 
                who<br>
                have always something to say; and therefore the old elf king wishes 
                to<br>
                make a great display.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Who is to be invited?&quot; asked the raven.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;All the world may come to the great ball, even human beings, 
                if<br>
                they can only talk in their sleep, or do something after our<br>
                fashion. But for the feast the company must be carefully selected;<br>
                we can only admit persons of high rank; I have had a dispute myself<br>
                with the elf king, as he thought we could not admit ghosts. The 
                merman and his daughter must be invited first, although it may 
                not be<br>
                agreeable to them to remain so long on dry land, but they shall 
                have a<br>
                wet stone to sit on, or perhaps something better; so I think they 
                will<br>
                not refuse this time. We must have all the old demons of the first<br>
                class, with tails, and the hobgoblins and imps; and then I think 
                we<br>
                ought not to leave out the death-horse, or the grave-pig, or even<br>
                the church dwarf, although they do belong to the clergy, and are 
                not<br>
                reckoned among our people; but that is merely their office, they 
                are<br>
                nearly related to us, and visit us very frequently.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Croak,&quot; said the night-raven as he flew away with 
                the invitations.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The elfin maidens we're already dancing on the elf hill, and<br>
                they danced in shawls woven from moonshine and mist, which look 
                very pretty to those who like such things. The large hall within 
                the elf<br>
                hill was splendidly decorated; the floor had been washed with<br>
                moonshine, and the walls had been rubbed with magic ointment, 
                so<br>
                that they glowed like tulip-leaves in the light. In the kitchen 
                were<br>
                frogs roasting on the spit, and dishes preparing of snail skins,<br>
                with children's fingers in them, salad of mushroom seed, hemlock,<br>
                noses and marrow of mice, beer from the marsh woman's brewery, 
                and sparkling salt-petre wine from the grave cellars. These were 
                all<br>
                substantial food. Rusty nails and church-window glass formed the<br>
                dessert. The old elf king had his gold crown polished up with 
                powdered slate-pencil; it was like that used by the first form, 
                and very<br>
                difficult for an elf king to obtain. In the bedrooms, curtains 
                were<br>
                hung up and fastened with the slime of snails; there was, indeed, 
                a<br>
                buzzing and humming everywhere.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now we must fumigate the place with burnt horse-hair and 
                pig's<br>
                bristles, and then I think I shall have done my part,&quot; said 
                the elf<br>
                man-servant.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Father, dear,&quot; said the youngest daughter, &quot;may 
                I now hear who<br>
                our high-born visitors are?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, I suppose I must tell you now,&quot; he replied; 
                &quot;two of my<br>
                daughters must prepare themselves to be married, for the marriages<br>
                certainly will take place. The old goblin from Norway, who lives 
                in<br>
                the ancient Dovre mountains, and who possesses many castles built 
                of rock and freestone, besides a gold mine, which is better than 
                all,<br>
                so it is thought, is coming with his two sons, who are both seeking<br>
                a wife. The old goblin is a true-hearted, honest, old Norwegian<br>
                graybeard; cheerful and straightforward. I knew him formerly, 
                when<br>
                we used to drink together to our good fellowship: he came here 
                once to fetch his wife, she is dead now. She was the daughter 
                of the king of the chalk-hills at Moen. They say he took his wife 
                from chalk; I shall be delighted to see him again. It is said 
                that the boys are<br>
                ill-bred, forward lads, but perhaps that is not quite correct, 
                and<br>
                they will become better as they grow older. Let me see that you 
                know<br>
                how to teach them good manners.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And when are they coming?&quot; asked the daughter.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That depends upon wind and weather,&quot; said the elf 
                king; &quot;they<br>
                travel economically. They will come when there is the chance of 
                a<br>
                ship. I wanted them to come over to Sweden, but the old man was 
                not inclined to take my advice. He does not go forward with the 
                times, and that I do not like.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Two will-o'-the-wisps came jumping in, one quicker than the other,<br>
                so of course, one arrived first. &quot;They are coming! they are 
                coming!&quot;<br>
                he cried.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Give me my crown,&quot; said the elf king, &quot;and let 
                me stand in the<br>
                moonshine.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The daughters drew on their shawls and bowed down to the ground.<br>
                There stood the old goblin from the Dovre mountains, with his 
                crown of hardened ice and polished fir-cones. Besides this, he 
                wore a<br>
                bear-skin, and great, warm boots, while his sons went with their<br>
                throats bare and wore no braces, for they were strong men.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Is that a hill?&quot; said the youngest of the boys, pointing 
                to the<br>
                elf hill, &quot;we should call it a hole in Norway.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Boys,&quot; said the old man, &quot;a hole goes in, and 
                a hill stands<br>
                out; have you no eyes in your heads?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Another thing they wondered at was, that they were able without<br>
                trouble to understand the language.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Take care,&quot; said the old man, &quot;or people will 
                think you have<br>
                not been well brought up.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then they entered the elfin hill, where the select and grand<br>
                company were assembled, and so quickly had they appeared that 
                they<br>
                seemed to have been blown together. But for each guest the neatest 
                and pleasantest arrangement had been made. The sea folks sat at 
                table in great water-tubs, and they said it was just like being 
                at home. All<br>
                behaved themselves properly excepting the two young northern goblins; 
                they put their legs on the table and thought they were all right.<br>
                &quot;Feet off the table-cloth!&quot; said the old goblin. They 
                obeyed,<br>
                but not immediately. Then they tickled the ladies who waited at 
                table,<br>
                with the fir-cones, which they carried in their pockets. They 
                took off<br>
                their boots, that they might be more at ease, and gave them to 
                the<br>
                ladies to hold. But their father, the old goblin, was very<br>
                different; he talked pleasantly about the stately Norwegian rocks, 
                and<br>
                told fine tales of the waterfalls which dashed over them with 
                a<br>
                clattering noise like thunder or the sound of an organ, spreading<br>
                their white foam on every side. He told of the salmon that leaps 
                in<br>
                the rushing waters, while the water-god plays on his golden harp. 
                He<br>
                spoke of the bright winter nights, when the sledge bells are<br>
                ringing, and the boys run with burning torches across the smooth<br>
                ice, which is so transparent that they can see the fishes dart 
                forward<br>
                beneath their feet. He described everything so clearly, that those 
                who<br>
                listened could see it all; they could see the saw-mills going, 
                the<br>
                men-servants and the maidens singing songs, and dancing a rattling<br>
                dance,- when all at once the old goblin gave the old elfin maiden 
                a<br>
                kiss, such a tremendous kiss, and yet they were almost strangers 
                to<br>
                each other.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the elfin girls had to dance, first in the usual way, and<br>
                then with stamping feet, which they performed very well; then 
                followed the artistic and solo dance. Dear me, how they did throw 
                their legs about! No one could tell where the dance begun, or 
                where it ended, nor indeed which were legs and which were arms, 
                for they were all flying about together, like the shavings in 
                a saw-pit! And then they spun round so quickly that the death-horse 
                and the grave-pig became sick and giddy, and were obliged to leave 
                the table.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Stop!&quot; cried the old goblin,&quot; is that the only 
                house-keeping they<br>
                can perform? Can they do anything more than dance and throw about<br>
                their legs, and make a whirlwind?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You shall soon see what they can do,&quot; said the elf 
                king. And then<br>
                he called his youngest daughter to him. She was slender and fair 
                as<br>
                moonlight, and the most graceful of all the sisters. She took 
                a<br>
                white chip in her mouth, and vanished instantly; this was her<br>
                accomplishment. But the old goblin said he should not like his 
                wife to<br>
                have such an accomplishment, and thought his boys would have the<br>
                same objection. Another daughter could make a figure like herself<br>
                follow her, as if she had a shadow, which none of the goblin folk 
                ever<br>
                had. The third was of quite a different sort; she had learnt in 
                the<br>
                brew-house of the moor witch how to lard elfin puddings with<br>
                glow-worms.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;She will make a good housewife,&quot; said the old goblin, 
                and then<br>
                saluted her with his eyes instead of drinking her health; for 
                he did<br>
                not drink much.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now came the fourth daughter, with a large harp to play upon;<br>
                and when she struck the first chord, every one lifted up the left<br>
                leg (for the goblins are left-legged), and at the second chord 
                they<br>
                found they must all do just what she wanted.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is a dangerous woman,&quot; said the old goblin; and 
                the two sons<br>
                walked out of the hill; they had had enough of it. &quot;And what 
                can the<br>
                next daughter do?&quot; asked the old goblin.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I have learnt everything that is Norwegian,&quot; said 
                she; &quot;and I<br>
                will never marry, unless I can go to Norway.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then her youngest sister whispered to the old goblin, &quot;That 
                is<br>
                only because she has heard, in a Norwegian song, that when the 
                world shall decay, the cliffs of Norway will remain standing like 
                monuments; and she wants to get there, that she may be safe; for 
                she is so afraid of sinking.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ho! ho!&quot; said the old goblin, &quot;is that what she 
                means? Well, what<br>
                can the seventh and last do?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The sixth comes before the seventh,&quot; said the elf 
                king, for he<br>
                could reckon; but the sixth would not come forward.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I can only tell people the truth,&quot; said she. &quot;No 
                one cares for<br>
                me, nor troubles himself about me; and I have enough to do to 
                sew my grave clothes.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So the seventh and last came; and what could she do? Why, she<br>
                could tell stories, as many as you liked, on any subject.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Here are my five fingers,&quot; said the old goblin; &quot;now 
                tell me a<br>
                story for each of them.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So she took him by the wrist, and he laughed till he nearly<br>
                choked; and when she came to the fourth finger, there was a gold<br>
                ring on it, as if it knew there was to be a betrothal. Then the 
                old<br>
                goblin said, &quot;Hold fast what you have: this hand is yours; 
                for I<br>
                will have you for a wife myself.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the elfin girl said that the stories about the ring-finger<br>
                and little Peter Playman had not yet been told.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We will hear them in the winter,&quot; said the old goblin, 
                &quot;and<br>
                also about the fir and the birch-trees, and the ghost stories, 
                and<br>
                of the tingling frost. You shall tell your tales, for no one over<br>
                there can do it so well; and we will sit in the stone rooms, where 
                the<br>
                pine logs are burning, and drink mead out of the golden drinking-horn 
                of the old Norwegian kings. The water-god has given me two; and 
                when we sit there, Nix comes to pay us a visit, and will sing 
                you all the songs of the mountain shepherdesses. How merry we 
                shall be! </p>
              <p>The salmon will be leaping in the waterfalls, and dashing against 
                the stone walls, but he will not be able to come in. It is indeed 
                very pleasant to live in old Norway. But where are the lads?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Where indeed were they? Why, running about the fields, and blowing<br>
                out the will-o'-the-wisps, who so good-naturedly came and brought<br>
                their torches.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What tricks have you been playing?&quot; said the old goblin. 
                &quot;I<br>
                have taken a mother for you, and now you may take one of your 
                aunts.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the youngsters said they would rather make a speech and<br>
                drink to their good fellowship; they had no wish to marry. Then 
                they<br>
                made speeches and drank toasts, and tipped their glasses, to show 
                that they were empty. Then they took off their coats, and lay 
                down on the table to sleep; for they made themselves quite at 
                home. But the old goblin danced about the room with his young 
                bride, and exchanged boots with her, which is more fashionable 
                than exchanging rings.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The cock is crowing,&quot; said the old elfin maiden who 
                acted as<br>
                housekeeper; now we must close the shutters, that the sun may 
                not<br>
                scorch us.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the hill closed up. But the lizards continued to run up 
                and<br>
                down the riven tree; and one said to the other, &quot;Oh, how 
                much I was<br>
                pleased with the old goblin!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The boys pleased me better,&quot; said the earth-worm. 
                But then the<br>
                poor miserable creature could not see.</p>

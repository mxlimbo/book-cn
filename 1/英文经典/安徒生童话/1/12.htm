              <p class="h" align="center"> EVERYTHING IN THE RIGHT PLACE</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IT is more than a hundred years ago! At the border of the wood,<br>
                near a large lake, stood the old mansion: deep ditches surrounded 
                it<br>
                on every side, in which reeds and bulrushes grew. Close by the<br>
                drawbridge, near the gate, there was an old willow tree, which 
                bent<br>
                over the reeds.<br>
              </p>
              <p>From the narrow pass came the sound of bugles and the trampling 
                of<br>
                horses' feet; therefore a little girl who was watching the geese<br>
                hastened to drive them away from the bridge, before the whole<br>
                hunting party came galloping up; they came, however, so quickly,<br>
                that the girl, in order to avoid being run over, placed herself 
                on one<br>
                of the high corner-stones of the bridge. She was still half a 
                child<br>
                and very delicately built; she had bright blue eyes, and a gentle,<br>
                sweet expression. But such things the baron did not notice; while 
                he<br>
                was riding past the little goose-girl, he reversed his hunting 
                crop,<br>
                and in rough play gave her such a push with it that she fell<br>
                backward into the ditch.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Everything in the right place!&quot; he cried. &quot;Into 
                the ditch with<br>
                you.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then he burst out laughing, for that he called fun; the others<br>
                joined in- the whole party shouted and cried, while the hounds 
                barked.<br>
              </p>
              <p>While the poor girl was falling she happily caught one of the<br>
                branches of the willow tree, by the help of which she held herself<br>
                over the water, and as soon as the baron with his company and 
                the dogs had disappeared through the gate, the girl endeavoured 
                to scramble up, but the branch broke off, and she would have fallen 
                backward among the rushes, had not a strong hand from above seized 
                her at this moment. It was the hand of a pedlar; he had witnessed 
                what had happened from a short distance, and now hastened to assist 
                her.</p>
              <p> &quot;Everything in the right place,&quot; he said, imitating 
                the noble<br>
                baron, and pulling the little maid up to the dry ground. He wished<br>
                to put the branch back in the place it had been broken off, but 
                it<br>
                is not possible to put everything in the right place;&quot; therefore 
                he<br>
                stuck the branch into the soft ground.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Grow and thrive if you can, and produce a good flute for 
                them<br>
                yonder at the mansion,&quot; he said; it would have given him 
                great<br>
                pleasure to see the noble baron and his companions well thrashed. 
              </p>
              <p>Then he entered the castle- but not the banqueting hall; he was 
                too<br>
                humble for that. No; he went to the servants' hall. The men-servants<br>
                and maids looked over his stock of articles and bargained with 
                him;<br>
                loud crying and screaming were heard from the master's table above:<br>
                they called it singing- indeed, they did their best. Laughter 
                and<br>
                the howls of dogs were heard through the open windows: there they 
                were feasting and revelling; wine and strong old ale were foaming 
                in the glasses and jugs; the favourite dogs ate with their masters; 
                now and then the squires kissed one of these animals, after having 
                wiped its mouth first with the tablecloth. They ordered the pedlar 
                to come up, but only to make fun of him. The wine had got into 
                their heads, and reason had left them. They poured beer into a 
                stocking that he could drink with them, but quick. That's what 
                they called fun, and it made them laugh. Then meadows, peasants, 
                and farmyards were staked on one card and lost.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Everything in the right place!&quot; the pedlar said when 
                he had at<br>
                last safely got out of Sodom and Gomorrah, as he called it. &quot;The<br>
                open high road is my right place; up there I did not feel at ease.&quot;<br>
                The little maid, who was still watching the geese, nodded kindly<br>
                to him as he passed through the gate.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Days and weeks passed, and it was seen that the broken<br>
                willow-branch which the peddlar had stuck into the ground near 
                the<br>
                ditch remained fresh and green- nay, it even put forth fresh twigs;<br>
                the little goose-girl saw that the branch had taken root, and 
                was very<br>
                pleased; the tree, so she said, was now her tree. While the tree 
                was<br>
                advancing, everything else at the castle was going backward, through<br>
                feasting and gambling, for these are two rollers upon which nobody<br>
                stands safely. Less than six years afterwards the baron passed 
                out<br>
                of his castle-gate a poor beggar, while the baronial seat had 
                been<br>
                bought by a rich tradesman. He was the very pedlar they had made 
                fun of and poured beer into a stocking for him to drink; but honesty 
                and industry bring one forward, and now the pedlar was the possessor 
                of the baronial estate. From that time forward no card-playing 
                was permitted there.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That's a bad pastime,&quot; he said; &quot;when the devil 
                saw the Bible for<br>
                the first time he wanted to produce a caricature in opposition 
                to<br>
                it, and invented card-playing.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The new proprietor of the estate took a wife, and whom did he<br>
                take?- The little goose-girl, who had always remained good and 
                kind,<br>
                and who looked as beautiful in her new clothes as if she had been 
                a<br>
                lady of high birth. And how did all this come about? That would 
                be too long a tale to tell in our busy time, but it really happened, 
                and<br>
                the most important events have yet to be told.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was pleasant and cheerful to live in the old place now: the<br>
                mother superintended the household, and the father looked after 
                things out-of-doors, and they were indeed very prosperous.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Where honesty leads the way, prosperity is sure to follow. The 
                old<br>
                mansion was repaired and painted, the ditches were cleaned and<br>
                fruit-trees planted; all was homely and pleasant, and the floors<br>
                were as white and shining as a pasteboard. In the long winter 
                evenings<br>
                the mistress and her maids sat at the spinning-wheel in the large<br>
                hall; every Sunday the counsellor- this title the pedlar had obtained,<br>
                although only in his old days- read aloud a portion from the Bible.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The children (for they had children) all received the best education, 
                but they were not all equally clever, as is the case in all families.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the meantime the willow tree near the drawbridge had grown 
                up<br>
                into a splendid tree, and stood there, free, and was never clipped.<br>
                &quot;It is our genealogical tree,&quot; said the old people to 
                their<br>
                children, &quot;and therefore it must be honoured.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>A hundred years had elapsed. It was in our own days; the lake<br>
                had been transformed into marsh land; the whole baronial seat 
                had,<br>
                as it were, disappeared. A pool of water near some ruined walls 
                was<br>
                the only remainder of the deep ditches; and here stood a magnificent<br>
                old tree with overhanging branches- that was the genealogical 
                tree.<br>
                Here it stood, and showed how beautiful a willow can look if one<br>
                does not interfere with it. The trunk, it is true, was cleft in 
                the<br>
                middle from the root to the crown; the storms had bent it a little,<br>
                but it still stood there, and out of every crevice and cleft, 
                in which<br>
                wind and weather had carried mould, blades of grass and flowers 
                sprang forth. Especially above, where the large boughs parted, 
                there was quite a hanging garden, in which wild raspberries and 
                hart's-tongue ferns throve, and even a little mistletoe had taken 
                root, and grew gracefully in the old willow branches, which were 
                reflected in the<br>
                dark water beneath when the wind blew the chickweed into the corner 
                of the pool. A footpath which led across the fields passed close 
                by the old tree. High up, on the woody hillside, stood the new 
                mansion. It had a splendid view, and was large and magnificent; 
                its window panes were so clear that one might have thought there 
                were none there at all. The large flight of steps which led to 
                the entrance looked like a<br>
                bower covered with roses and broad-leaved plants. The lawn was 
                as<br>
                green as if each blade of grass was cleaned separately morning 
                and<br>
                evening. Inside, in the hall, valuable oil paintings were hanging 
                on<br>
                the walls. Here stood chairs and sofas covered with silk and velvet,<br>
                which could be easily rolled about on castors; there were tables<br>
                with polished marble tops, and books bound in morocco with gilt 
                edges.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Indeed, well-to-do and distinguished people lived here; it was 
                the<br>
                dwelling of the baron and his family. Each article was in keeping 
                with<br>
                its surroundings. &quot;Everything in the right place&quot; was 
                the motto<br>
                according to which they also acted here, and therefore all the<br>
                paintings which had once been the honour and glory of the old<br>
                mansion were now hung up in the passage which led to the servants'<br>
                rooms. It was all old lumber, especially two portraits- one<br>
                representing a man in a scarlet coat with a wig, and the other 
                a<br>
                lady with powdered and curled hair holding a rose in her hand, 
                each of them being surrounded by a large wreath of willow branches. 
                Both<br>
                portraits had many holes in them, because the baron's sons used 
                the<br>
                two old people as targets for their crossbows. They represented 
                the<br>
                counsellor and his wife, from whom the whole family descended. 
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But they did not properly belong to our family,&quot; said 
                one of the boys; &quot;he was a pedlar and she kept the geese. 
                They were not like papa and mamma.&quot; The portraits were old 
                lumber, and &quot;everything in its right place.&quot; That was 
                why the great-grandparents had been hung up in the passage leading 
                to the servants' rooms.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The son of the village pastor was tutor at the mansion. One day 
                he<br>
                went for a walk across the fields with his young pupils and their<br>
                elder sister, who had lately been confirmed. They walked along 
                the<br>
                road which passed by the old willow tree, and while they were 
                on the<br>
                road she picked a bunch of field-flowers. &quot;Everything in 
                the right<br>
                place,&quot; and indeed the bunch looked very beautiful. At the 
                same time<br>
                she listened to all that was said, and she very much liked to 
                hear the<br>
                pastor's son speak about the elements and of the great men and 
                women in history. She had a healthy mind, noble in thought and 
                deed, and with a heart full of love for everything that God had 
                created. They<br>
                stopped at the old willow tree, as the youngest of the baron's 
                sons<br>
                wished very much to have a flute from it, such as had been cut 
                for him from other willow trees; the pastor's son broke a branch 
                off. </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, pray do not do it!&quot; said the young lady; but it 
                was already done.<br>
                &quot;That is our famous old tree. I love it very much. They often 
                laugh at<br>
                me at home about it, but that does not matter. There is a story<br>
                attached to this tree.&quot; And now she told him all that we 
                already<br>
                know about the tree- the old mansion, the pedlar and the goose-girl<br>
                who had met there for the first time, and had become the ancestors<br>
                of the noble family to which the young lady belonged.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;They did not like to be knighted, the good old people,&quot; 
                she said;<br>
                &quot;their motto was 'everything in the right place,' and it 
                would not<br>
                be right, they thought, to purchase a title for money. My grandfather,<br>
                the first baron, was their son. They say he was a very learned 
                man,<br>
                a great favourite with the princes and princesses, and was invited<br>
                to all court festivities. The others at home love him best; but, 
                I<br>
                do not know why, there seemed to me to be something about the 
                old<br>
                couple that attracts my heart! How homely, how patriarchal, it 
                must<br>
                have been in the old mansion, where the mistress sat at the<br>
                spinning-wheel with her maids, while her husband read aloud out 
                of the Bible!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;They must have been excellent, sensible people,&quot; said 
                the<br>
                pastor's son. And with this the conversation turned naturally 
                to<br>
                noblemen and commoners; from the manner in which the tutor spoke 
                about the significance of being noble, it seemed almost as if 
                he did not belong to a commoner's family.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is good fortune to be of a family who have distinguished<br>
                themselves, and to possess as it were a spur in oneself to advance<br>
                to all that is good. It is a splendid thing to belong to a noble<br>
                family, whose name serves as a card of admission to the highest<br>
                circles. Nobility is a distinction; it is a gold coin that bears 
                the<br>
                stamp of its own value. It is the fallacy of the time, and many<br>
                poets express it, to say that all that is noble is bad and stupid, 
                and<br>
                that, on the contrary, the lower one goes among the poor, the 
                more<br>
                brilliant virtues one finds. I do not share this opinion, for 
                it is<br>
                wrong. In the upper classes one sees many touchingly beautiful 
                traits;<br>
                my own mother has told me of such, and I could mention several. 
              </p>
              <p>One day she was visiting a nobleman's house in town; my grandmother, 
                I believe, had been the lady's nurse when she was a child. My 
                mother and the nobleman were alone in the room, when he suddenly 
                noticed an old woman on crutches come limping into the courtyard; 
                she came every Sunday to carry a gift away with her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'There is the poor old woman,' said the nobleman; 'it is 
                so<br>
                difficult for her to walk.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;My mother had hardly understood what he said before he<br>
                disappeared from the room, and went downstairs, in order to save 
                her<br>
                the troublesome walk for the gift she came to fetch. Of course 
                this is<br>
                only a little incident, but it has its good sound like the poor<br>
                widow's two mites in the Bible, the sound which echoes in the 
                depth of every human heart; and this is what the poet ought to 
                show and point out- more especially in our own time he ought to 
                sing of this; it does good, it mitigates and reconciles! But when 
                a man, simply because he is of noble birth and possesses a genealogy, 
                stands on his hind legs and neighs in the street like an Arabian 
                horse, and says when a commoner has been in a room: 'Some people 
                from the street have been here,' there nobility is decaying; it 
                has become a mask of the kind that Thespis created, and it is 
                amusing when such a person is<br>
                exposed in satire.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Such was the tutor's speech; it was a little long, but while 
                he<br>
                delivered it he had finished cutting the flute.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There was a large party at the mansion; many guests from the<br>
                neighbourhood and from the capital had arrived. There were ladies 
                with tasteful and with tasteless dresses; the big hall was quite 
                crowded with people. The clergymen stood humbly together in a 
                corner, and looked as if they were preparing for a funeral, but 
                it was a festival-only the amusement had not yet begun. A great 
                concert was to take place, and that is why the baron's young son 
                had brought his willow<br>
                flute with him; but he could not make it sound, nor could his<br>
                father, and therefore the flute was good for nothing.<br>
                There was music and songs of the kind which delight most those<br>
                that perform them; otherwise quite charming!<br>
                &quot;Are you an artist?&quot; said a cavalier, the son of his 
                father;<br>
                &quot;you play on the flute, you have made it yourself; it is 
                genius that<br>
                rules- the place of honour is due to you.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Certainly not! I only advance with the time, and that of 
                course<br>
                one can't help.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I hope you will delight us all with the little instrument- 
                will<br>
                you not?&quot; Thus saying he handed to the tutor the flute which 
                had<br>
                been cut from the willow tree by the pool; and then announced 
                in a<br>
                loud voice that the tutor wished to perform a solo on the flute.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They wished to tease him- that was evident, and therefore the 
                tutor<br>
                declined to play, although he could do so very well. They urged 
                and<br>
                requested him, however, so long, that at last he took up the flute 
                and<br>
                placed it to his lips.<br>
              </p>
              <p>That was a marvellous flute! Its sound was as thrilling as the<br>
                whistle of a steam engine; in fact it was much stronger, for it<br>
                sounded and was heard in the yard, in the garden, in the wood, 
                and<br>
                many miles round in the country; at the same time a storm rose 
                and<br>
                roared; &quot;Everything in the right place.&quot; And with this 
                the baron, as<br>
                if carried by the wind, flew out of the hall straight into the<br>
                shepherd's cottage, and the shepherd flew- not into the hall,<br>
                thither he could not come- but into the servants' hall, among 
                the<br>
                smart footmen who were striding about in silk stockings; these 
                haughty menials looked horror-struck that such a person ventured 
                to sit at table with them. But in the hall the baron's daughter 
                flew to the<br>
                place of honour at the end of the table- she was worthy to sit<br>
                there; the pastor's son had the seat next to her; the two sat 
                there as<br>
                if they were a bridal pair. An old Count, belonging to one of 
                the<br>
                oldest families of the country, remained untouched in his place 
                of<br>
                honour; the flute was just, and it is one's duty to be so. The<br>
                sharp-tongued cavalier who had caused the flute to be played, 
                and<br>
                who was the child of his parents, flew headlong into the fowl-house,<br>
                but not he alone.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The flute was heard at the distance of a mile, and strange<br>
                events took place. A rich banker's family, who were driving in 
                a coach and four, were blown out of it, and could not even find 
                room behind it with their footmen. Two rich farmers who had in 
                our days shot up higher than their own corn-fields, were flung 
                into the ditch; it was a dangerous flute. Fortunately it burst 
                at the first sound, and that was a good thing, for then it was 
                put back into its owner's pocket- &quot;its right place.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The next day, nobody spoke a word about what had taken place; 
                thus<br>
                originated the phrase, &quot;to pocket the flute.&quot; Everything 
                was again<br>
                in its usual order, except that the two old pictures of the peddlar<br>
                and the goose-girl were hanging in the banqueting-hall. There 
                they<br>
                were on the wall as if blown up there; and as a real expert said<br>
                that they were painted by a master's hand, they remained there 
                and<br>
                were restored. &quot;Everything in the right place,&quot; and 
                to this it will<br>
                come. Eternity is long, much longer indeed than this story.</p>

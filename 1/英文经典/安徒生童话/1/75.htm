              <p class="h" align="center"> THE OLD BACHELOR'S NIGHTCAP</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THERE is a street in Copenhagen with a very strange name. It 
                is<br>
                called &quot;Hysken&quot; street. Where the name came from, and 
                what it means is very uncertain. It is said to be German, but 
                that is unjust to the Germans, for it would then be called &quot;Hauschen,&quot; 
                not &quot;Hysken.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Hauschen,&quot; means a little house; and for many years 
                it consisted only of a few small houses, which were scarcely larger 
                than the wooden booths we see in the market-places at fair time. 
                They were perhaps a little higher, and had windows; but the panes 
                consisted of horn or bladder-skins, for glass was then too dear 
                to have glazed windows in every house. This was a long time ago, 
                so long indeed that our grandfathers, and even great-grandfathers, 
                would speak of those days as &quot;olden times;&quot; indeed, 
                many centuries have passed since then.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The rich merchants in Bremen and Lubeck, who carried on trade 
                in<br>
                Copenhagen, did not reside in the town themselves, but sent their<br>
                clerks, who dwelt in the wooden booths in the Hauschen street, 
                and<br>
                sold beer and spices. The German beer was very good, and there 
                were many sorts- from Bremen, Prussia, and Brunswick- and quantities 
                of all sorts of spices, saffron, aniseed, ginger, and especially 
                pepper; indeed, pepper was almost the chief article sold here; 
                so it happened at last that the German clerks in Denmark got their 
                nickname of &quot;pepper gentry.&quot; It had been made a condition 
                with these clerks that they should not marry; so that those who 
                lived to be old had to take care of themselves, to attend to their 
                own comforts, and even to light their own fires, when they had 
                any to light. Many of<br>
                them were very aged; lonely old boys, with strange thoughts and<br>
                eccentric habits. From this, all unmarried men, who have attained 
                a<br>
                certain age, are called, in Denmark, &quot;pepper gentry;&quot; 
                and this must be<br>
                remembered by all those who wish to understand the story. These<br>
                &quot;pepper gentlemen,&quot; or, as they are called in England, 
                &quot;old<br>
                bachelors,&quot; are often made a butt of ridicule; they are told 
                to put on<br>
                their nightcaps, draw them over their eyes, and go to sleep. The<br>
                boys in Denmark make a song of it, thus:-</p>
              <p> &quot;Poor old bachelor, cut your wood,<br>
                Such a nightcap was never seen;<br>
                Who would think it was ever clean?<br>
                Go to sleep, it will do you good.&quot;</p>
              <p> So they sing about the &quot;pepper gentleman;&quot; so do they 
                make sport<br>
                of the poor old bachelor and his nightcap, and all because they 
                really<br>
                know nothing of either. It is a cap that no one need wish for, 
                or<br>
                laugh at. And why not? Well, we shall hear in the story.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In olden times, Hauschen Street was not paved, and passengers<br>
                would stumble out of one hole into another, as they generally 
                do in<br>
                unfrequented highways; and the street was so narrow, and the booths<br>
                leaning against each other were so close together, that in the<br>
                summer time a sail would be stretched across the street from one 
                booth to another opposite. At these times the odor of the pepper, 
                saffron, and ginger became more powerful than ever. Behind the 
                counter, as a rule, there were no young men. The clerks were almost 
                all old boys; but they did not dress as we are accustomed to see 
                old men represented, wearing wigs, nightcaps, and knee-breeches, 
                and with coat and waistcoat buttoned up to the chin. We have seen 
                the portraits of our great-grandfathers dressed in this way; but 
                the &quot;pepper gentlemen&quot; had no money to spare to have 
                their portraits taken, though one of them would have made a very 
                interesting picture for us now, if taken as he appeared standing 
                behind his counter, or going to church, or on holidays. On these 
                occasions, they wore high-crowned, broad-brimmed hats, and sometimes 
                a younger clerk would stick a feather in his.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The woollen shirt was concealed by a broad, linen collar; the 
                close<br>
                jacket was buttoned up to the chin, and the cloak hung loosely 
                over<br>
                it; the trousers were tucked into the broad, tipped shoes, for 
                the<br>
                clerks wore no stockings. They generally stuck a table-knife and 
                spoon in their girdles, as well as a larger knife, as a protection 
                to<br>
                themselves; and such a weapon was often very necessary.<br>
              </p>
              <p>After this fashion was Anthony dressed on holidays and<br>
                festivals, excepting that, instead of a high-crowned hat, he wore 
                a<br>
                kind of bonnet, and under it a knitted cap, a regular nightcap, 
                to<br>
                which he was so accustomed that it was always on his head; he 
                had two, nightcaps I mean, not heads. Anthony was one of the oldest 
                of the clerks, and just the subject for a painter. He was as thin 
                as a<br>
                lath, wrinkled round the mouth and eyes, had long, bony fingers,<br>
                bushy, gray eyebrows, and over his left eye hung a thick tuft 
                of hair,<br>
                which did not look handsome, but made his appearance very<br>
                remarkable. People knew that he came from Bremen; it was not exactly 
                his home, although his master resided there. His ancestors were 
                from Thuringia, and had lived in the town of Eisenach, close by 
                Wartburg.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Old Anthony seldom spoke of this place, but he thought of it 
                all the<br>
                more.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The old clerks of Hauschen Street very seldom met together; each<br>
                one remained in his own booth, which was closed early enough in 
                the<br>
                evening, and then it looked dark and dismal out in the street. 
                Only<br>
                a faint glimmer of light struggled through the horn panes in the<br>
                little window on the roof, while within sat the old clerk, generally<br>
                on his bed, singing his evening hymn in a low voice; or he would 
                be<br>
                moving about in his booth till late in the night, busily employed 
                in<br>
                many things. It certainly was not a very lively existence. To 
                be a<br>
                stranger in a strange land is a bitter lot; no one notices you<br>
                unless you happen to stand in their way. Often, when it was dark 
                night outside, with rain or snow falling, the place looked quite 
                deserted and gloomy. There were no lamps in the street, excepting 
                a very small one, which hung at one end of the street, before 
                a picture of the Virgin, which had been painted on the wall. The 
                dashing of the<br>
                water against the bulwarks of a neighboring castle could plainly 
                be<br>
                heard. Such evenings are long and dreary, unless people can find<br>
                something to do; and so Anthony found it. There were not always 
                things to be packed or unpacked, nor paper bags to be made, nor 
                the scales to be polished. So Anthony invented employment; he 
                mended his clothes and patched his boots, and when he at last 
                went to bed,- his nightcap, which he had worn from habit, still 
                remained on his head; he had only to pull it down a little farther 
                over his forehead. </p>
              <p>Very soon, however, it would be pushed up again to see if the 
                light was properly put out; he would touch it, press the wick 
                together, and at last pull his nightcap over his eyes and lie 
                down again on the other<br>
                side. But often there would arise in his mind a doubt as to whether<br>
                every coal had been quite put out in the little fire-pan in the 
                shop<br>
                below. If even a tiny spark had remained it might set fire to<br>
                something, and cause great damage. Then he would rise from his 
                bed,<br>
                creep down the ladder- for it could scarcely be called a flight 
                of<br>
                stairs- and when he reached the fire-pan not a spark could be 
                seen; so<br>
                he had just to go back again to bed. But often, when he had got 
                half<br>
                way back, he would fancy the iron shutters of the door were not<br>
                properly fastened, and his thin legs would carry him down again. 
                And<br>
                when at last he crept into bed, he would be so cold that his teeth<br>
                chattered in his head. He would draw the coverlet closer round 
                him,<br>
                pull his nightcap over his eyes, and try to turn his thoughts 
                from<br>
                trade, and from the labors of the day, to olden times. But this 
                was<br>
                scarcely an agreeable entertainment; for thoughts of olden memories<br>
                raise the curtains from the past, and sometimes pierce the heart<br>
                with painful recollections till the agony brings tears to the 
                waking<br>
                eyes. And so it was with Anthony; often the scalding tears, like<br>
                pearly drops, would fall from his eyes to the coverlet and roll 
                on the<br>
                floor with a sound as if one of his heartstrings had broken.<br>
                Sometimes, with a lurid flame, memory would light up a picture 
                of life<br>
                which had never faded from his heart. If he dried his eyes with 
                his<br>
                nightcap, then the tear and the picture would be crushed; but 
                the<br>
                source of the tears remained and welled up again in his heart. 
                The<br>
                pictures did not follow one another in order, as the circumstances<br>
                they represented had occurred; very often the most painful would<br>
                come together, and when those came which were most full of joy, 
                they had always the deepest shadow thrown upon them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The beech woods of Denmark are acknowledged by every one to be<br>
                very beautiful, but more beautiful still in the eyes of old Anthony<br>
                were the beech woods in the neighborhood of Wartburg. More grand 
                and venerable to him seemed the old oaks around the proud baronial 
                castle, where the creeping plants hung over the stony summits 
                of the rocks; sweeter was the perfume there of the apple-blossom 
                than in all the land of Denmark. How vividly were represented 
                to him, in a<br>
                glittering tear that rolled down his cheek, two children at play- 
                a<br>
                boy and a girl. The boy had rosy cheeks, golden ringlets, and 
                clear,<br>
                blue eyes; he was the son of Anthony, a rich merchant; it was 
                himself.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The little girl had brown eyes and black hair, and was clever 
                and<br>
                courageous; she was the mayor's daughter, Molly. The children 
                were<br>
                playing with an apple; they shook the apple, and heard the pips<br>
                rattling in it. Then they cut it in two, and each of them took 
                half.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They also divided the pips and ate all but one, which the little<br>
                girl proposed should be placed in the ground.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You will see what will come out,&quot; she said; &quot;something 
                you<br>
                don't expect. A whole apple-tree will come out, but not directly.&quot;<br>
                Then they got a flower-pot, filled it with earth, and were soon 
                both<br>
                very busy and eager about it. The boy made a hole in the earth 
                with<br>
                his finger, and the little girl placed the pip in the hole, and 
                then<br>
                they both covered it over with earth.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now you must not take it out to-morrow to see if it has 
                taken<br>
                root,&quot; said Molly; &quot;no one ever should do that. I did 
                so with my<br>
                flowers, but only twice; I wanted to see if they were growing. 
                I<br>
                didn't know any better then, and the flowers all died.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Little Anthony kept the flower-pot, and every morning during 
                the<br>
                whole winter he looked at it, but there was nothing to be seen 
                but<br>
                black earth. At last, however, the spring came, and the sun shone 
                warm again, and then two little green leaves sprouted forth in 
                the pot.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;They are Molly and me,&quot; said the boy. &quot;How wonderful 
                they are,<br>
                and so beautiful!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Very soon a third leaf made its appearance.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Who does that stand for?&quot; thought he, and then came 
                another and<br>
                another. Day after day, and week after week, till the plant became<br>
                quite a tree. And all this about the two children was mirrored 
                to<br>
                old Anthony in a single tear, which could soon be wiped away and<br>
                disappear, but might come again from its source in the heart of 
                the<br>
                old man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the neighborhood of Eisenach stretches a ridge of stony<br>
                mountains, one of which has a rounded outline, and shows itself<br>
                above the rest without tree, bush, or grass on its barren summits.<br>
                It is called the &quot;Venus Mountain,&quot; and the story goes 
                that the &quot;Lady<br>
                Venus,&quot; one of the heathen goddesses, keeps house there. 
                She is also<br>
                called &quot;Lady Halle,&quot; as every child round Eisenach well 
                knows. She<br>
                it was who enticed the noble knight, Tannhauser, the minstrel, 
                from<br>
                the circle of singers at Wartburg into her mountain.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Little Molly and Anthony often stood by this mountain, and one 
                day<br>
                Molly said, &quot;Do you dare to knock and say, 'Lady Halle, Lady 
                Halle,<br>
                open the door: Tannhauser is here!'&quot; But Anthony did not 
                dare.<br>
                Molly, however, did, though she only said the words, &quot;Lady 
                Halle, Lady Halle,&quot; loudly and distinctly; the rest she muttered 
                so much under her breath that Anthony felt certain she had really 
                said nothing; and yet she looked quite bold and saucy, just as 
                she did sometimes when she was in the garden with a number of 
                other little girls; they<br>
                would all stand round him together, and want to kiss him, because 
                he<br>
                did not like to be kissed, and pushed them away. Then Molly was 
                the<br>
                only one who dared to resist him. &quot;I may kiss him,&quot; 
                she would say<br>
                proudly, as she threw her arms round his neck; she was vain of 
                her<br>
                power over Anthony, for he would submit quietly and think nothing 
                of it. Molly was very charming, but rather bold; and how she did 
                tease! They said Lady Halle was beautiful, but her beauty was 
                that of a tempting fiend. Saint Elizabeth, the tutelar saint of 
                the land, the<br>
                pious princess of Thuringia, whose good deeds have been immortalized 
                in so many places through stories and legends, had greater beauty 
                and more real grace. Her picture hung in the chapel, surrounded 
                by silver lamps; but it did not in the least resemble Molly.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The apple-tree, which the two children had planted, grew year<br>
                after year, till it became so large that it had to be transplanted<br>
                into the garden, where the dew fell and the sun shone warmly. 
                And<br>
                there it increased in strength so much as to be able to withstand<br>
                the cold of winter; and after passing through the severe weather, 
                it<br>
                seemed to put forth its blossoms in spring for very joy that the<br>
                cold season had gone. In autumn it produced two apples, one for<br>
                Molly and one for Anthony; it could not well do less. The tree 
                after<br>
                this grew very rapidly, and Molly grew with the tree. She was 
                as fresh<br>
                as an apple-blossom, but Anthony was not to behold this flower 
                for<br>
                long. All things change; Molly's father left his old home, and 
                Molly<br>
                went with him far away. In our time, it would be only a journey 
                of a<br>
                few hours, but then it took more than a day and a night to travel 
                so<br>
                far eastward from Eisenbach to a town still called Weimar, on 
                the<br>
                borders of Thuringia. And Molly and Anthony both wept, but these 
                tears all flowed together into one tear which had the rosy shimmer 
                of joy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Molly had told him that she loved him- loved him more than all 
                the<br>
                splendors of Weimar.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One, two, three years went by, and during the whole time he<br>
                received only two letters. One came by the carrier, and the other 
                a<br>
                traveller brought. The way was very long and difficult, with many<br>
                turnings and windings through towns and villages. How often had<br>
                Anthony and Molly heard the story of Tristan and Isolda, and Anthony 
                had thought the story applied to him, although Tristan means born 
                in sorrow, which Anthony certainly was not; nor was it likely 
                he would ever say of Molly as Tristan said of Isolda, &quot;She 
                has forgotten me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But in truth, Isolda had not forgotten him, her faithful friend; 
                and<br>
                when both were laid in their graves, one, on each side of the<br>
                church, the linden-trees that grew by each grave spread over the 
                roof,<br>
                and, bending towards each other, mingled their blossoms together.<br>
                Anthony thought it a very beautiful but mournful story; yet he 
                never<br>
                feared anything so sad would happen to him and Molly, as he passed 
                the spot, whistling the air of a song, composed by the minstrel 
                Walter, called the &quot;Willow bird,&quot; beginning-</p>
              <p> &quot;Under the linden-trees,<br>
                Out on the heath.&quot;</p>
              <p> One stanza pleased him exceedingly-</p>
              <p> &quot;Through the forest, and in the vale,<br>
                Sweetly warbles the nightingale.</p>
              <p> This song was often in his mouth, and he sung or whistled it 
                on<br>
                a moonlight night, when he rode on horseback along the deep, hollow<br>
                way, on his road to Weimar, to visit Molly. He wished to arrive<br>
                unexpectedly, and so indeed he did. He was received with a hearty<br>
                welcome, and introduced to plenty of grand and pleasant company, 
                where overflowing winecups were passed about. A pretty room and 
                a good bed were provided for him, and yet his reception was not 
                what he had expected and dreamed it would be. He could not comprehend 
                his own feelings nor the feelings of others; but it is easily 
                understood how a person can be admitted into a house or a family 
                without becoming one of them. We converse in company with those 
                we meet, as we converse with our fellow-travellers in a stage-coach, 
                on a journey; we know nothing of them, and perhaps all the while 
                we are incommoding one another, and each is wishing himself or 
                his neighbor away. Something of this kind Anthony felt when Molly 
                talked to him of old times.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I am a straightforward girl,&quot; she said, &quot;and 
                I will tell you<br>
                myself how it is. There have been great changes since we were 
                children together; everything is different, both inwardly and 
                outwardly. We cannot control our wills, nor the feelings of our 
                hearts, by the force of custom. Anthony, I would not, for the 
                world, make an enemy of you when I am far away. Believe me, I 
                entertain for you the kindest wishes in my heart; but to feel 
                for you what I now know can be felt for another man, can never 
                be. You must try and reconcile yourself to this. Farewell, Anthony.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Anthony also said, &quot;Farewell.&quot; Not a tear came into 
                his eye; he<br>
                felt he was no longer Molly's friend. Hot iron and cold iron alike<br>
                take the skin from our lips, and we feel the same sensation if 
                we kiss<br>
                either; and Anthony's kiss was now the kiss of hatred, as it had<br>
                once been the kiss of love. Within four-and-twenty hours Anthony 
                was back again to Eisenach, though the horse that he rode was 
                entirely ruined.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What matters it?&quot; said he; &quot;I am ruined also. 
                I will destroy<br>
                everything that can remind me of her, or of Lady Halle, or Lady 
                Venus,<br>
              </p>
              <p>the heathen woman. I will break down the apple-tree, and tear 
                it up by<br>
                the roots; never more shall it blossom or bear fruit.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The apple-tree was not broken down; for Anthony himself was struck<br>
                with a fever, which caused him to break down, and confined him 
                to<br>
                his bed. But something occurred to raise him up again. What was 
                it?<br>
              </p>
              <p>A medicine was offered to him, which he was obliged to take: 
                a<br>
                bitter remedy, at which the sick body and the oppressed spirit 
                alike<br>
                shuddered. Anthony's father lost all his property, and, from being<br>
                known as one of the richest merchants, he became very poor. Dark 
                days, heavy trials, with poverty at the door, came rolling into 
                the house upon them like the waves of the sea. Sorrow and suffering 
                deprived Anthony's father of his strength, so that he had something 
                else to think of besides nursing his love-sorrows and his anger 
                against Molly.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He had to take his father's place, to give orders, to act with 
                energy,<br>
                to help, and, at last, to go out into the world and earn his bread.<br>
                Anthony went to Bremen, and there he learnt what poverty and hard<br>
                living really were. These things often harden the character, but<br>
                sometimes soften the heart, even too much.<br>
              </p>
              <p>How different the world, and the people in it, appeared to Anthony<br>
                now, to what he had thought in his childhood! What to him were 
                the<br>
                minstrel's songs? An echo of the past, sounds long vanished. At<br>
                times he would think in this way; yet again and again the songs<br>
                would sound in his soul, and his heart become gentle and pious.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;God's will is the best,&quot; he would then say. &quot;It 
                was well that I<br>
                was not allowed to keep my power over Molly's heart, and that 
                she<br>
                did not remain true to me. How I should have felt it now, when 
                fortune has deserted me! She left me before she knew of the change 
                in my circumstances, or had a thought of what was before me. That 
                is a merciful providence for me. All has happened for the best. 
                She could not help it, and yet I have been so bitter, and in such 
                enmity against her.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Years passed by: Anthony's father died, and strangers lived in 
                the<br>
                old house. He had seen it once again since then. His rich master<br>
                sent him journeys on business, and on one occasion his way led 
                him<br>
                to his native town of Eisenach. The old Wartburg castle stood<br>
                unchanged on the rock where the monk and the nun were hewn out 
                of<br>
                the stone. The great oaks formed an outline to the scene which 
                he so<br>
                well remembered in his childhood. The Venus mountain stood out 
                gray and bare, overshadowing the valley beneath. He would have 
                been glad to call out &quot;Lady Halle, Lady Halle, unlock the 
                mountain. I would fain remain here always in my native soil.&quot; 
                That was a sinful thought, and he offered a prayer to drive it 
                away. Then a little bird in the thicket sang out clearly, and 
                old Anthony thought of the minstrel's<br>
                song. How much came back to his remembrance as he looked through 
                the tears once more on his native town! The old house was still 
                standing as in olden times, but the garden had been greatly altered; 
                a pathway led through a portion of the ground, and outside the 
                garden, and beyond the path, stood the old apple-tree, which he 
                had not broken down, although he talked of doing so in his trouble. 
                The sun still threw its rays upon the tree, and the refreshing 
                dew fell upon it as of old; and it was so overloaded with fruit 
                that the branches bent towards the earth with the weight. &quot;That 
                flourishes still,&quot; said he, as he gazed. One of the branches 
                of the tree had, however, been broken: mischievous hands must 
                have done this in passing, for the tree now stood in a public 
                thoroughfare. &quot;The blossoms are often plucked,&quot; said 
                Anthony; &quot;the fruit is stolen and the branches broken without 
                a thankful thought of their profusion and beauty. It might be 
                said of a tree, as it has been said of some men- it was not predicted 
                at his cradle that he should come to this. How brightly began 
                the history of this tree, and what is it now? Forsaken and forgotten, 
                in a garden by a hedge in a field, and close to a public<br>
                road. There it stands, unsheltered, plundered, and broken. It<br>
                certainly has not yet withered; but in the course of years the<br>
                number of blossoms from time to time will grow less, and at last 
                it<br>
                was cease altogether to bear fruit; and then its history will 
                be<br>
                over.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Such were Anthony's thoughts as he stood under the tree, and<br>
                during many a long night as he lay in his lonely chamber in the 
                wooden house in Hauschen Street, Copenhagen, in the foreign land 
                to which the rich merchant of Bremen, his employer, had sent him 
                on condition that he should never marry. &quot;Marry! ha, ha!&quot; 
                and he laughed bitterly to himself at the thought.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Winter one year set in early, and it was freezing hard. Without, 
                a<br>
                snowstorm made every one remain at home who could do so. Thus 
                it<br>
                happened that Anthony's neighbors, who lived opposite to him, 
                did<br>
                not notice that his house remained unopened for two days, and 
                that<br>
                he had not showed himself during that time, for who would go out 
                in<br>
                such weather unless he were obliged to do so. They were gray, 
                gloomy days, and in the house whose windows were not glass, twilight 
                and dark nights reigned in turns. During these two days old Anthony 
                had not left his bed, he had not the strength to do so. The bitter 
                weather had for some time affected his limbs. There lay the old 
                bachelor, forsaken by all, and unable to help himself. He could 
                scarcely reach the water jug that he had placed by his bed, and 
                the last drop was gone.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was not fever, nor sickness, but old age, that had laid him 
                low. In<br>
                the little corner, where his bed lay, he was over-shadowed as 
                it<br>
                were by perpetual night. A little spider, which he could however 
                not<br>
                see, busily and cheerfully spun its web above him, so that there<br>
                should be a kind of little banner waving over the old man, when 
                his<br>
                eyes closed. The time passed slowly and painfully. He had no tears<br>
                to shed, and he felt no pain; no thought of Molly came into his<br>
                mind. He felt as if the world was now nothing to him, as if he 
                were<br>
                lying beyond it, with no one to think of him. Now and then he 
                felt<br>
                slight sensations of hunger and thirst; but no one came to him, 
                no one<br>
                tended him. He thought of all those who had once suffered from<br>
                starvation, of Saint Elizabeth, who once wandered on the earth, 
                the<br>
                saint of his home and his childhood, the noble Duchess of Thuringia,<br>
                that highly esteemed lady who visited the poorest villages, bringing<br>
                hope and relief to the sick inmates. The recollection of her pious<br>
                deeds was as light to the soul of poor Anthony. He thought of 
                her as<br>
                she went about speaking words of comfort, binding up the wounds 
                of the afflicted and feeding the hungry, although often blamed 
                for it by her stern husband. He remembered a story told of her, 
                that on one<br>
                occasion, when she was carrying a basket full of wine and<br>
                provisions, her husband, who had watched her footsteps, stepped<br>
                forward and asked her angrily what she carried in her basket,<br>
                whereupon, with fear and trembling, she answered, &quot;Roses, 
                which I have plucked from the garden.&quot; Then he tore away 
                the cloth which covered the basket, and what could equal the surprise 
                of the pious woman, to find that by a miracle, everything in her 
                basket- the wine, the bread- had all been changed into roses.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In this way the memory of the kind lady dwelt in the calm mind<br>
                of Anthony. She was as a living reality in his little dwelling 
                in<br>
                the Danish land. He uncovered his face that he might look into 
                her<br>
                gentle eyes, while everything around him changed from its look 
                of<br>
                poverty and want, to a bright rose tint. The fragrance of roses 
                spread<br>
                through the room, mingled with the sweet smell of apples. He saw 
                the<br>
                branches of an apple-tree spreading above him. It was the tree 
                which<br>
                he and Molly had planted together. The fragrant leaves of the 
                tree<br>
                fell upon him and cooled his burning brow; upon his parched lips<br>
                they seemed like refreshing bread and wine; and as they rested 
                on<br>
                his breast, a peaceful calm stole over him, and he felt inclined 
                to<br>
                sleep. &quot;I shall sleep now,&quot; he whispered to himself. 
                &quot;Sleep will do me<br>
                good. In the morning I shall be upon my feet again, strong and 
                well.<br>
                Glorious! wonderful! That apple-tree, planted in love, now appears<br>
                before me in heavenly beauty.&quot; And he slept.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The following day, the third day during which his house had been<br>
                closed, the snow-storm ceased. Then his opposite neighbor stepped 
                over to the house in which old Anthony lived, for he had not yet 
                showed himself. There he lay stretched on his bed, dead, with 
                his old<br>
                nightcap tightly clasped in his two hands. The nightcap, however,<br>
                was not placed on his head in his coffin; he had a clean white 
                one<br>
                on then. Where now were the tears he had shed? What had become 
                of those wonderful pearls? They were in the nightcap still. Such 
                tears as these cannot be washed out, even when the nightcap is 
                forgotten. </p>
              <p>The old thoughts and dreams of a bachelor's nightcap still remain. 
                Never wish for such a nightcap. It would make your forehead hot, 
                cause your pulse to beat with agitation, and conjure up dreams 
                which would appear realities.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The first who wore old Anthony's cap felt the truth of this,<br>
                though it was half a century afterwards. That man was the mayor<br>
                himself, who had already made a comfortable home for his wife 
                and<br>
                eleven children, by his industry. The moment he put the cap on 
                he<br>
                dreamed of unfortunate love, of bankruptcy, and of dark days.<br>
                &quot;Hallo! how the nightcap burns!&quot; he exclaimed, as he 
                tore it from<br>
                his bead. Then a pearl rolled out, and then another, and another,<br>
                and they glittered and sounded as they fell. &quot;What can this 
                be? Is<br>
                it paralysis, or something dazzling my eyes?&quot; They were the 
                tears<br>
                which old Anthony had shed half a century before.<br>
              </p>
              <p>To every one who afterwards put this cap on his head, came visions<br>
                and dreams which agitated him not a little. His own history was<br>
                changed into that of Anthony till it became quite a story, and 
                many<br>
                stories might be made by others, so we will leave them to relate 
                their<br>
                own. We have told the first; and our last word is, don't wish 
                for a<br>
                &quot;bachelor's nightcap.&quot;</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> SOUP FROM A SAUSAGE SKEWER</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> &quot;WE had such an excellent dinner yesterday,&quot; said 
                an old mouse<br>
                of the female sex to another who had not been present at the feast. 
                &quot;I<br>
                sat number twenty-one below the mouse-king, which was not a bad 
                place.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Shall I tell you what we had? Everything was first rate. Mouldy 
                bread,<br>
                tallow candle, and sausage. And then, when we had finished that<br>
                course, the same came on all over again; it was as good as two 
                feasts.<br>
              </p>
              <p>We were very sociable, and there was as much joking and fun as 
                if we had been all of one family circle. Nothing was left but 
                the sausage<br>
                skewers, and this formed a subject of conversation, till at last 
                it<br>
                turned to the proverb, 'Soup from sausage skins;' or, as the people 
                in<br>
                the neighboring country call it, 'Soup from a sausage skewer.' 
                Every<br>
                one had heard the proverb, but no one had ever tasted the soup, 
                much less prepared it. A capital toast was drunk to the inventor 
                of the<br>
                soup, and some one said he ought to be made a relieving officer 
                to the poor. Was not that witty? Then the old mouse-king rose 
                and promised that the young lady-mouse who should learn how best 
                to prepare this much-admired and savory soup should be his queen, 
                and a year and a day should be allowed for the purpose.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That was not at all a bad proposal,&quot; said the other 
                mouse; &quot;but<br>
                how is the soup made?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah, that is more than I can tell you. All the young lady 
                mice<br>
                were asking the same question. They wished very much to be queen,<br>
                but they did not want to take the trouble of going out into the<br>
                world to learn how to make soup, which was absolutely necessary 
                to<br>
                be done first. But it is not every one who would care to leave 
                her<br>
                family, or her happy corner by the fire-side at home, even to 
                be<br>
                made queen. It is not always easy to find bacon and cheese-rind 
                in<br>
                foreign lands every day, and it is not pleasant to have to endure<br>
                hunger, and be perhaps, after all, eaten up alive by the cat.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Most probably some such thoughts as these discouraged the<br>
                majority from going out into the world to collect the required<br>
                information. Only four mice gave notice that they were ready to 
                set<br>
                out on the journey. They were young and lively, but poor. Each 
                of them wished to visit one of the four divisions of the world, 
                so that it<br>
                might be seen which was the most favored by fortune. Every one 
                took a sausage skewer as a traveller's staff, and to remind them 
                of the<br>
                object of their journey. They left home early in May, and none 
                of them returned till the first of May in the following year, 
                and then only<br>
                three of them. Nothing was seen or heard of the fourth, although 
                the<br>
                day of decision was close at hand. &quot;Ah, yes, there is always 
                some<br>
                trouble mixed up with the greatest pleasure,&quot; said the mouse-king; 
                but<br>
                he gave orders that all the mice within a circle of many miles<br>
                should be invited at once. They were to assemble in the kitchen, 
                and<br>
                the three travelled mice were to stand in a row before them, while 
                a<br>
                sausage skewer, covered with crape, was to be stuck up instead 
                of<br>
                the missing mouse. No one dared to express an opinion until the 
                king<br>
                spoke, and desired one of them to go on with her story. And now 
                we<br>
                shall hear what she said.<br>
              </p>
              <p>WHAT THE FIRST LITTLE MOUSE<br>
                SAW AND HEARD ON HER TRAVELS</p>
              <p> &quot;When I first went out into the world,&quot; said the little 
                mouse,<br>
                &quot;I fancied, as so many of my age do, that I already knew 
                everything,<br>
                but it was not so. It takes years to acquire great knowledge. 
                I went<br>
                at once to sea in a ship bound for the north. I had been told 
                that the<br>
                ship's cook must know how to prepare every dish at sea, and it 
                is easy enough to do that with plenty of sides of bacon, and large 
                tubs of salt meat and mouldy flour. There I found plenty of delicate 
                food, but no opportunity for learning how to make soup from a 
                sausage skewer. We sailed on for many days and nights; the ship 
                rocked fearfully, and we did not escape without a wetting. As 
                soon as we arrived at the port to which the ship was bound, I 
                left it, and went on shore at a place far towards the north. It 
                is a wonderful thing to leave your own little corner at home, 
                to hide yourself in a ship where there are sure to be some nice 
                snug corners for shelter, then suddenly to find yourself thousands 
                of miles away in a foreign land. I saw large<br>
                pathless forests of pine and birch trees, which smelt so strong 
                that I<br>
                sneezed and thought of sausage. There were great lakes also which<br>
                looked as black as ink at a distance, but were quite clear when 
                I came<br>
                close to them. Large swans were floating upon them, and I thought 
                at<br>
                first they were only foam, they lay so still; but when I saw them 
                walk<br>
                and fly, I knew what they were directly. They belong to the goose<br>
                species, one can see that by their walk. No one can attempt to<br>
                disguise family descent. I kept with my own kind, and associated<br>
                with the forest and field mice, who, however, knew very little,<br>
                especially about what I wanted to know, and which had actually 
                made me travel abroad. The idea that soup could be made from a 
                sausage<br>
                skewer was to them such an out-of-the-way, unlikely thought, that 
                it<br>
                was repeated from one to another through the whole forest. They<br>
                declared that the problem would never be solved, that the thing 
                was an impossibility. How little I thought that in this place, 
                on the very<br>
                first night, I should be initiated into the manner of its preparation.<br>
                &quot;It was the height of summer, which the mice told me was 
                the<br>
                reason that the forest smelt so strong, and that the herbs were 
                so<br>
                fragrant, and the lakes with the white swimming swans so dark, 
                and yet so clear. On the margin of the wood, near to three or 
                four houses, a pole, as large as the mainmast of a ship, had been 
                erected, and from<br>
                the summit hung wreaths of flowers and fluttering ribbons; it 
                was<br>
                the Maypole. Lads and lasses danced round the pole, and tried 
                to outdo the violins of the musicians with their singing. They 
                were as merry as ever at sunset and in the moonlight, but I took 
                no part in the<br>
                merry-making. What has a little mouse to do with a Maypole dance? 
                I<br>
                sat in the soft moss, and held my sausage skewer tight. The moon 
                threw its beams particularly on one spot where stood a tree covered 
                with exceedingly fine moss. I may almost venture to say that it 
                was as fine and soft as the fur of the mouse-king, but it was 
                green, which is a<br>
                color very agreeable to the eye. All at once I saw the most charming<br>
                little people marching towards me. They did not reach higher than 
                my<br>
                knee; they looked like human beings, but were better proportioned, 
                and they called themselves elves. Their clothes were very delicate 
                and<br>
                fine, for they were made of the leaves of flowers, trimmed with 
                the<br>
                wings of flies and gnats, which had not a bad effect. By their 
                manner,<br>
                it appeared as if they were seeking for something. I knew not 
                what,<br>
                till at last one of them espied me and came towards me, and the<br>
                foremost pointed to my sausage skewer, and said, 'There, that 
                is<br>
                just what we want; see, it is pointed at the top; is it not capital?' 
                and the longer he looked at my pilgrim's staff, the more delighted 
                he became. 'I will lend it to you,' said I, 'but not to keep.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Oh no, we won't keep it!' they all cried; and then they 
                seized<br>
                the skewer, which I gave up to them, and danced with it to the 
                spot<br>
                where the delicate moss grew, and set it up in the middle of the<br>
                green. They wanted a maypole, and the one they now had seemed 
                cut<br>
                out on purpose for them. Then they decorated it so beautifully 
                that it<br>
                was quite dazzling to look at. Little spiders spun golden threads<br>
                around it, and then it was hung with fluttering veils and flags 
                so<br>
                delicately white that they glittered like snow in the moonshine. 
                After<br>
                that they took colors from the butterfly's wing, and sprinkled 
                them<br>
                over the white drapery &quot;which gleamed as if covered with 
                flowers and<br>
                diamonds, so that I could not recognize my sausage skewer at all. 
              </p>
              <p>Such a maypole had never been seen in all the world as this. 
                Then came a great company of real elves. Nothing could be finer 
                than their<br>
                clothes, and they invited me to be present at the feast; but I 
                was<br>
                to keep at a certain distance, because I was too large for them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then commenced such music that it sounded like a thousand glass 
                bells, and was so full and strong that I thought it must be the 
                song of the swans. I fancied also that I heard the voices of the 
                cuckoo and the<br>
                black-bird, and it seemed at last as if the whole forest sent 
                forth<br>
                glorious melodies- the voices of children, the tinkling of bells,<br>
                and the songs of the birds; and all this wonderful melody came 
                from<br>
                the elfin maypole. My sausage peg was a complete peal of bells. 
                I<br>
                could scarcely believe that so much could have been produced from<br>
                it, till I remembered into what hands it had fallen. I was so 
                much<br>
                affected that I wept tears such as a little mouse can weep, but 
                they<br>
                were tears of joy. The night was far too short for me; there are 
                no<br>
                long nights there in summer, as we often have in this part of 
                the<br>
                world. When the morning dawned, and the gentle breeze rippled 
                the<br>
                glassy mirror of the forest lake, all the delicate veils and flags<br>
                fluttered away into thin air; the waving garlands of the spider's 
                web,<br>
                the hanging bridges and galleries, or whatever else they may be<br>
                called, vanished away as if they had never been. Six elves brought<br>
                me back my sausage skewer, and at the same time asked me to make 
                any request, which they would grant if in their power; so I begged 
                them, if they could, to tell me how to make soup from a sausage 
                skewer.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'How do we make it?' said the chief of the elves with a 
                smile.<br>
              </p>
              <p>'Why you have just seen it; you scarcely knew your sausage skewer<br>
                again, I am sure.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;They think themselves very wise, thought I to myself. Then 
                I told<br>
                them all about it, and why I had travelled so far, and also what<br>
                promise had been made at home to the one who should discover the<br>
                method of preparing this soup. 'What use will it be,' I asked, 
                'to the<br>
                mouse-king or to our whole mighty kingdom that I have seen all 
                these<br>
                beautiful things? I cannot shake the sausage peg and say, Look, 
                here<br>
                is the skewer, and now the soup will come. That would only produce 
                a dish to be served when people were keeping a fast.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Then the elf dipped his finger into the cup of a violet, 
                and said<br>
                to me, 'Look here, I will anoint your pilgrim's staff, so that 
                when<br>
                you return to your own home and enter the king's castle, you have 
                only to touch the king with your staff, and violets will spring 
                forth and<br>
                cover the whole of it, even in the coldest winter time; so I think 
                I<br>
                have given you really something to carry home, and a little more<br>
                than something.'&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But before the little mouse explained what this something more<br>
                was, she stretched her staff out to the king, and as it touched 
                him<br>
                the most beautiful bunch of violets sprang forth and filled the<br>
                place with perfume. The smell was so powerful that the mouse-king<br>
                ordered the mice who stood nearest the chimney to thrust their 
                tails<br>
                into the fire, that there might be a smell of burning, for the 
                perfume<br>
                of the violets was overpowering, and not the sort of scent that<br>
                every one liked.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But what was the something more of which you spoke just 
                now?&quot;<br>
                asked the mouse-king.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why,&quot; answered the little mouse, &quot;I think it 
                is what they call<br>
                'effect;'&quot; and thereupon she turned the staff round, and 
                behold not<br>
                a single flower was to be seen upon it! She now only held the 
                naked<br>
                skewer, and lifted it up as a conductor lifts his baton at a<br>
                concert. &quot;Violets, the elf told me,&quot; continued the mouse, 
                &quot;are for the<br>
                sight, the smell, and the touch; so we have only now to produce 
                the<br>
                effect of hearing and tasting;&quot; and then, as the little mouse 
                beat<br>
                time with her staff, there came sounds of music, not such music 
                as was heard in the forest, at the elfin feast, but such as is 
                often heard in<br>
                the kitchen- the sounds of boiling and roasting. It came quite<br>
                suddenly, like wind rushing through the chimneys, and seemed as 
                if<br>
                every pot and kettle were boiling over. The fire-shovel clattered 
                down<br>
                on the brass fender; and then, quite as suddenly, all was still,-<br>
                nothing could be heard but the light, vapory song of the tea-kettle,<br>
                which was quite wonderful to hear, for no one could rightly<br>
                distinguish whether the kettle was just beginning to boil or going<br>
                to stop. And the little pot steamed, and the great pot simmered, 
                but<br>
                without any regard for each; indeed there seemed no sense in the<br>
                pots at all. And as the little mouse waved her baton still more<br>
                wildly, the pots foamed and threw up bubbles, and boiled over; 
                while<br>
                again the wind roared and whistled through the chimney, and at 
                last<br>
                there was such a terrible hubbub, that the little mouse let her<br>
                stick fall.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is a strange sort of soup,&quot; said the mouse-king; 
                &quot;shall we<br>
                not now hear about the preparation?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is all,&quot; answered the little mouse, with a bow.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That all!&quot; said the mouse-king; &quot;then we shall 
                be glad to hear<br>
                what information the next may have to give us.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>WHAT THE SECOND MOUSE HAD TO TELL</p>
              <p> &quot;I was born in the library, at a castle,&quot; said the 
                second mouse.<br>
                &quot;Very few members of our family ever had the good fortune 
                to get<br>
                into the dining-room, much less the store-room. On my journey, 
                and<br>
                here to-day, are the only times I have ever seen a kitchen. We 
                were<br>
                often obliged to suffer hunger in the library, but then we gained 
                a<br>
                great deal of knowledge. The rumor reached us of the royal prize<br>
                offered to those who should be able to make soup from a sausage<br>
                skewer. Then my old grandmother sought out a manuscript which,<br>
                however, she could not read, but had heard it read, and in it 
                was<br>
                written, 'Those who are poets can make soup of sausage skewers.' 
              </p>
              <p>She then asked me if I was a poet. I felt myself quite innocent 
                of any<br>
                such pretensions. Then she said I must go out and make myself 
                a<br>
                poet. I asked again what I should be required to do, for it seemed<br>
                to me quite as difficult as to find out how to make soup of a<br>
                sausage skewer. My grandmother had heard a great deal of reading 
                in<br>
                her day, and she told me three principal qualifications were<br>
                necessary- understanding, imagination, and feeling. 'If you can 
                manage to acquire these three, you will be a poet, and the sausage-skewer 
                soup will be quite easy to you.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;So I went forth into the world, and turned my steps towards 
                the<br>
                west, that I might become a poet. Understanding is the most<br>
                important matter in everything. I knew that, for the two other<br>
                qualifications are not thought much of; so I went first to seek 
                for<br>
                understanding. Where was I to find it? 'Go to the ant and learn<br>
                wisdom,' said the great Jewish king. I knew that from living in 
                a<br>
                library. So I went straight on till I came to the first great<br>
                ant-hill, and then I set myself to watch, that I might become 
                wise.<br>
                The ants are a very respectable people, they are wisdom itself. 
                All<br>
                they do is like the working of a sum in arithmetic, which comes 
                right.<br>
                'To work and to lay eggs,' say they, and to provide for posterity,<br>
                is to live out your time properly;' and that they truly do. They 
                are<br>
                divided into the clean and the dirty ants, their rank is pointed 
                out<br>
                by a number, and the ant-queen is number ONE; and her opinion 
                is the only correct one on everything; she seems to have the whole 
                wisdom of the world in her, which was just the important matter 
                I wished to acquire. She said a great deal which was no doubt 
                very clever; yet to me it sounded like nonsense. She said the 
                ant-hill was the loftiest thing in the world, and yet close to 
                the mound stood a tall tree, which no one could deny was loftier, 
                much loftier, but no mention was made of the tree. One evening 
                an ant lost herself on this tree; she had crept up the stem, not 
                nearly to the top, but higher than<br>
                any ant had ever ventured; and when at last she returned home 
                she said that she had found something in her travels much higher 
                than the<br>
                ant-hill. The rest of the ants considered this an insult to the<br>
                whole community; so she was condemned to wear a muzzle and to 
                live in perpetual solitude. A short time afterwards another ant 
                got on<br>
                the tree, and made the same journey and the same discovery, but 
                she<br>
                spoke of it cautiously and indefinitely, and as she was one of 
                the<br>
                superior ants and very much respected, they believed her, and 
                when she died they erected an eggshell as a monument to her memory, 
                for they cultivated a great respect for science. I saw,&quot; 
                said the little mouse, &quot;that the ants were always running 
                to and fro with her burdens on their backs. Once I saw one of 
                them drop her load; she gave herself a great deal of trouble in 
                trying to raise it again, but she could not succeed. Then two 
                others came up and tried with all their strength<br>
                to help her, till they nearly dropped their own burdens in doing 
                so;<br>
                then they were obliged to stop for a moment in their help, for 
                every<br>
                one must think of himself first. And the ant-queen remarked that 
                their<br>
                conduct that day showed that they possessed kind hearts and good<br>
                understanding. 'These two qualities,' she continued, 'place us 
                ants in<br>
                the highest degree above all other reasonable beings. Understanding<br>
                must therefore be seen among us in the most prominent manner, 
                and my wisdom is greater than all.' And so saying she raised herself 
                on her two hind legs, that no one else might be mistaken for her. 
                I could not therefore make an error, so I ate her up. We are to 
                go to the ants<br>
                to learn wisdom, and I had got the queen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I now turned and went nearer to the lofty tree already 
                mentioned,<br>
                which was an oak. It had a tall trunk with a wide-spreading top, 
                and<br>
                was very old. I knew that a living being dwelt here, a dryad as 
                she is<br>
                called, who is born with the tree and dies with it. I had heard 
                this<br>
                in the library, and here was just such a tree, and in it an oak-maiden. 
                She uttered a terrible scream when she caught sight of me so near 
                to her; like many women, she was very much afraid of mice. And 
                she had more real cause for fear than they have, for I might have 
                gnawed through the tree on which her life depended. I spoke to 
                her in a kind and friendly manner, and begged her to take courage.<br>
              </p>
              <p>At last she took me up in her delicate hand, and then I told 
                her<br>
                what had brought me out into the world, and she promised me that<br>
                perhaps on that very evening she should be able to obtain for 
                me one<br>
                of the two treasures for which I was seeking. She told me that<br>
                Phantaesus was her very dear friend, that he was as beautiful 
                as the<br>
                god of love, that he remained often for many hours with her under<br>
                the leafy boughs of the tree which then rustled and waved more 
                than<br>
                ever over them both. He called her his dryad, she said, and the 
                tree<br>
                his tree; for the grand old oak, with its gnarled trunk, was just 
                to<br>
                his taste. The root, spreading deep into the earth, the top rising<br>
                high in the fresh air, knew the value of the drifted snow, the 
                keen<br>
                wind, and the warm sunshine, as it ought to be known. 'Yes,' continued 
                the dryad, 'the birds sing up above in the branches, and talk 
                to each other about the beautiful fields they have visited in 
                foreign<br>
                lands; and on one of the withered boughs a stork has built his<br>
                nest,- it is beautifully arranged, and besides it is pleasant 
                to<br>
                hear a little about the land of the pyramids. All this pleases<br>
                Phantaesus, but it is not enough for him; I am obliged to relate 
                to<br>
                him of my life in the woods; and to go back to my childhood, when 
                I<br>
                was little, and the tree so small and delicate that a stinging-nettle 
                could overshadow it, and I have to tell everything that has happened 
                since then till now that the tree is so large and strong. Sit 
                you down now under the green bindwood and pay attention, when 
                Phantaesus comes I will find an opportunity to lay hold of his 
                wing and to pull out one of the little feathers. That feather 
                you shall have; a better was never given to any poet, it will 
                be quite enough for you.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And when Phantaesus came the feather was plucked, and,&quot; 
                said<br>
                the little mouse, &quot;I seized and put it in water, and kept 
                it there<br>
                till it was quite soft. It was very heavy and indigestible, but 
                I<br>
                managed to nibble it up at last. It is not so easy to nibble one's<br>
                self into a poet, there are so many things to get through. Now,<br>
                however, I had two of them, understanding and imagination; and 
                through these I knew that the third was to be found in the library. 
                A great man has said and written that there are novels whose sole 
                and only use appeared to be that they might relieve mankind of 
                overflowing tears- a kind of sponge, in fact, for sucking up feelings 
                and emotions. I remembered a few of these books, they had always 
                appeared tempting to the appetite; they had been much read, and 
                were so greasy, that they must have absorbed no end of emotions 
                in themselves. I retraced my steps to the library, and literally 
                devoured a whole novel, that is, properly speaking, the interior 
                or soft part of it; the crust, or binding, I left. When I had 
                digested not only this, but a second, I felt a stirring within 
                me; then I ate a small piece of a third<br>
                romance, and felt myself a poet. I said it to myself, and told 
                others the same. I had head-ache and back-ache, and I cannot tell 
                what<br>
                aches besides. I thought over all the stories that may be said 
                to be<br>
                connected with sausage pegs, and all that has ever been written<br>
                about skewers, and sticks, and staves, and splinters came to my<br>
                thoughts; the ant-queen must have had a wonderfully clear<br>
                understanding. I remembered the man who placed a white stick in 
                his<br>
                mouth by which he could make himself and the stick invisible. 
                I<br>
                thought of sticks as hobby-horses, staves of music or rhyme, of<br>
                breaking a stick over a man's back, and heaven knows how many 
                more phrases of the same sort relating to sticks, staves, and 
                skewers.<br>
              </p>
              <p>All my thoughts rein on skewers, sticks of wood, and staves; 
                and as<br>
                I am, at last, a poet, and I have worked terribly hard to make<br>
                myself one, I can of course make poetry on anything. I shall therefore<br>
                be able to wait upon you every day in the week with a poetical 
                history<br>
                of a skewer. And that is my soup.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;In that case,&quot; said the mouse-king, &quot;we will 
                hear what the<br>
                third mouse has to say.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Squeak, squeak,&quot; cried a little mouse at the kitchen 
                door; it was<br>
                the fourth, and not the third, of the four who were contending 
                for the<br>
                prize, one whom the rest supposed to be dead. She shot in like 
                an<br>
                arrow, and overturned the sausage peg that had been covered with<br>
                crape. She had been running day and night. She had watched an<br>
                opportunity to get into a goods train, and had travelled by the<br>
                railway; and yet she had arrived almost too late. She pressed 
                forward,<br>
                looking very much ruffled. She had lost her sausage skewer, but 
                not<br>
                her voice; for she began to speak at once as if they only waited 
                for<br>
                her, and would hear her only, and as if nothing else in the world<br>
                was of the least consequence. She spoke out so clearly and plainly,<br>
                and she had come in so suddenly, that no one had time to stop 
                her or<br>
                to say a word while she was speaking. And now let us hear what 
                she<br>
                said.<br>
              </p>
              <p>WHAT THE FOURTH MOUSE, WHO SPOKE<br>
                BEFORE THE THIRD, HAD TO TELL</p>
              <p> &quot;I started off at once to the largest town,&quot; said 
                she, &quot;but the<br>
                name of it has escaped me. I have a very bad memory for names. 
                I was carried from the railway, with some forfeited goods, to 
                the jail,<br>
                and on arriving I made my escape, and ran into the house of the<br>
                turnkey. The turnkey was speaking of his prisoners, especially 
                of<br>
                one who had uttered thoughtless words. These words had given rise 
                to other words, and at length they were written down and registered: 
              </p>
              <p>'The whole affair is like making soup of sausage skewers,' said 
                he, 'but the soup may cost him his neck.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now this raised in me an interest for the prisoner,&quot; 
                continued<br>
                the little mouse, &quot;and I watched my opportunity, and slipped 
                into<br>
                his apartment, for there is a mouse-hole to be found behind every<br>
                closed door. The prisoner looked pale; he had a great beard and 
                large, sparkling eyes. There was a lamp burning, but the walls 
                were so<br>
                black that they only looked the blacker for it. The prisoner scratched<br>
                pictures and verses with white chalk on the black walls, but I 
                did not<br>
                read the verses. I think he found his confinement wearisome, so 
                that I<br>
                was a welcome guest. He enticed me with bread-crumbs, with<br>
                whistling, and with gentle words, and seemed so friendly towards 
                me,<br>
                that by degrees I gained confidence in him, and we became friends;<br>
                he divided his bread and water with me, gave me cheese and sausage,<br>
                and I really began to love him. Altogether, I must own that it 
                was a<br>
                very pleasant intimacy. He let me run about on his hand, and on 
                his<br>
                arm, and into his sleeve; and I even crept into his beard, and 
                he<br>
                called me his little friend. I forgot what I had come out into 
                the<br>
                world for; forgot my sausage skewer which I had laid in a crack 
                in the<br>
                floor- it is lying there still. I wished to stay with him always 
                where<br>
                I was, for I knew that if I went away the poor prisoner would 
                have<br>
                no one to be his friend, which is a sad thing. I stayed, but he 
                did<br>
                not. He spoke to me so mournfully for the last time, gave me double 
                as much bread and cheese as usual, and kissed his hand to me. 
                Then he went away, and never came back. I know nothing more of 
                his history.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The jailer took possession of me now. He said something 
                about<br>
                soup from a sausage skewer, but I could not trust him. He took 
                me in<br>
                his hand certainly, but it was to place me in a cage like a tread-mill. 
                Oh how dreadful it was! I had to run round and round without getting 
                any farther in advance, and only to make everybody laugh. The 
                jailer's grand-daughter was a charming little thing. She had curly 
                hair like the brightest gold, merry eyes, and such a smiling mouth.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'You poor little mouse,' said she, one day as she peeped 
                into<br>
                my cage, 'I will set you free.' She then drew forth the iron<br>
                fastening, and I sprang out on the window-sill, and from thence 
                to the<br>
                roof. Free! free! that was all I could think of; not of the object<br>
                of my journey. It grew dark, and as night was coming on I found 
                a<br>
                lodging in an old tower, where dwelt a watchman and an owl. I 
                had no confidence in either of them, least of all in the owl, 
                which is like a<br>
                cat, and has a great failing, for she eats mice. One may however 
                be<br>
                mistaken sometimes; and so was I, for this was a respectable and<br>
                well-educated old owl, who knew more than the watchman, and even 
                as much as I did myself. The young owls made a great fuss about<br>
                everything, but the only rough words she would say to them were,<br>
                'You had better go and make some soup from sausage skewers.' She 
                was very indulgent and loving to her children. Her conduct gave 
                me such confidence in her, that from the crack where I sat I called 
                out<br>
                'squeak.' This confidence of mine pleased her so much that she 
                assured me she would take me under her own protection, and that 
                not a creature should do me harm. The fact was, she wickedly meant 
                to keep me in reserve for her own eating in winter, when food 
                would be scarce. Yet she was a very clever lady-owl; she explained 
                to me that the watchman could only hoot with the horn that hung 
                loose at his side; and then she said he is so terribly proud of 
                it, that he imagines<br>
                himself an owl in the tower;- wants to do great things, but only<br>
                succeeds in small; all soup on a sausage skewer. Then I begged 
                the owl to give me the recipe for this soup. 'Soup from a sausage 
                skewer,' said she, 'is only a proverb amongst mankind, and may 
                be understood in many ways. Each believes his own way the best, 
                and after all, the proverb signifies nothing.' 'Nothing!' I exclaimed. 
                I was quite struck. Truth is not always agreeable, but truth is 
                above everything else, as the old owl said. I thought over all 
                this, and saw quite plainly that if truth was really so far above 
                everything else, it must be much more valuable than soup from 
                a sausage skewer. So I hastened to get away, that I might be home 
                in time, and bring what was highest and best, and above everything- 
                namely, the truth. The mice are an enlightened people, and the 
                mouse-king is above them all. He is therefore capable of making 
                me queen for the sake of truth.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Your truth is a falsehood,&quot; said the mouse who had 
                not yet<br>
                spoken; &quot;I can prepare the soup, and I mean to do so.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>HOW IT WAS PREPARED</p>
              <p> &quot;I did not travel,&quot; said the third mouse; &quot;I 
                stayed in this<br>
                country: that was the right way. One gains nothing by travelling-<br>
                everything can be acquired here quite as easily; so I stayed at<br>
                home. I have not obtained what I know from supernatural beings. 
                I have neither swallowed it, nor learnt it from conversing with 
                owls. I<br>
                have got it all from my reflections and thoughts. Will you now 
                set the<br>
                kettle on the fire- so? Now pour the water in- quite full- up 
                to the<br>
                brim; place it on the fire; make up a good blaze; keep it burning,<br>
                that the water may boil; it must boil over and over. There, now 
                I<br>
                throw in the skewer. Will the mouse-king be pleased now to dip 
                his<br>
                tail into the boiling water, and stir it round with the tail. 
                The<br>
                longer the king stirs it, the stronger the soup will become. Nothing<br>
                more is necessary, only to stir it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Can no one else do this?&quot; asked the king.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No,&quot; said the mouse; &quot;only in the tail of the 
                mouse-king is<br>
                this power contained.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the water boiled and bubbled, as the mouse-king stood close<br>
                beside the kettle. It seemed rather a dangerous performance; but 
                he<br>
                turned round, and put out his tail, as mice do in a dairy, when 
                they<br>
                wish to skim the cream from a pan of milk with their tails and<br>
                afterwards lick it off. But the mous</p>

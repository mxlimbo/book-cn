              <p class="h" align="center"> THE CONCEITED APPLE-BRANCH</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IT was the month of May. The wind still blew cold; but from 
                bush<br>
                and tree, field and flower, came the welcome sound, &quot;Spring 
                is<br>
                come.&quot; Wild-flowers in profusion covered the hedges. Under 
                the<br>
                little apple-tree, Spring seemed busy, and told his tale from 
                one of<br>
                the branches which hung fresh and blooming, and covered with<br>
                delicate pink blossoms that were just ready to open. The branch 
                well<br>
                knew how beautiful it was; this knowledge exists as much in the 
                leaf<br>
                as in the blood; I was therefore not surprised when a nobleman's<br>
                carriage, in which sat the young countess, stopped in the road 
                just<br>
                by. She said that an apple-branch was a most lovely object, and 
                an<br>
                emblem of spring in its most charming aspect. Then the branch 
                was<br>
                broken off for her, and she held it in her delicate hand, and<br>
                sheltered it with her silk parasol. Then they drove to the castle,<br>
                in which were lofty halls and splendid drawing-rooms. Pure white<br>
                curtains fluttered before the open windows, and beautiful flowers<br>
                stood in shining, transparent vases; and in one of them, which<br>
                looked as if it had been cut out of newly fallen snow, the<br>
                apple-branch was placed, among some fresh, light twigs of beech. 
                It<br>
                was a charming sight. Then the branch became proud, which was 
                very much like human nature.<br>
              </p>
              <p>People of every description entered the room, and, according 
                to<br>
                their position in society, so dared they to express their admiration. 
                Some few said nothing, others expressed too much, and the apple-branch 
                very soon got to understand that there was as much difference 
                in the characters of human beings as in those of plants and flowers. 
                Some are all for pomp and parade, others have a great deal to 
                do to maintain their own importance, while the rest might be spared 
                without much loss to society. So thought the apple-branch, as 
                he stood before the open window, from which he could see out over 
                gardens and fields, where there were flowers and plants enough 
                for him to think and reflect upon; some rich and beautiful, some 
                poor and humble indeed.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Poor, despised herbs,&quot; said the apple-branch; &quot;there 
                is really<br>
                a difference between them and such as I am. How unhappy they must<br>
                be, if they can feel as those in my position do! There is a difference<br>
                indeed, and so there ought to be, or we should all be equals.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the apple-branch looked with a sort of pity upon them, especially 
                on a certain little flower that is found in fields and in ditches. 
                No one bound these flowers together in a nosegay; they were too 
                common; they were even known to grow between the paving-stones, 
                shooting up everywhere, like bad weeds; and they bore the very 
                ugly name of &quot;dog-flowers&quot; or &quot;dandelions.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Poor, despised plants,&quot; said the apple-bough, &quot;it 
                is not your<br>
                fault that you are so ugly, and that you have such an ugly name; 
                but<br>
                it is with plants as with men,- there must be a difference.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;A difference!&quot; cried the sunbeam, as he kissed the 
                blooming<br>
                apple-branch, and then kissed the yellow dandelion out in the<br>
                fields. All were brothers, and the sunbeam kissed them- the poor<br>
                flowers as well as the rich.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The apple-bough had never thought of the boundless love of God,<br>
                which extends over all the works of creation, over everything 
                which<br>
                lives, and moves, and has its being in Him; he had never thought 
                of<br>
                the good and beautiful which are so often hidden, but can never 
                remain forgotten by Him,- not only among the lower creation, but 
                also among men. The sunbeam, the ray of light, knew better.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You do not see very far, nor very clearly,&quot; he said 
                to the<br>
                apple-branch. &quot;Which is the despised plant you so specially 
                pity?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The dandelion,&quot; he replied. &quot;No one ever places 
                it in a<br>
                nosegay; it is often trodden under foot, there are so many of 
                them;<br>
                and when they run to seed, they have flowers like wool, which 
                fly away in little pieces over the roads, and cling to the dresses 
                of the<br>
                people. They are only weeds; but of course there must be weeds. 
                O, I am really very thankful that I was not made like one of these<br>
                flowers.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>There came presently across the fields a whole group of<br>
                children, the youngest of whom was so small that it had to be<br>
                carried by the others; and when he was seated on the grass, among<br>
                the yellow flowers, he laughed aloud with joy, kicked out his 
                little<br>
                legs, rolled about, plucked the yellow flowers, and kissed them 
                in<br>
                childlike innocence. The elder children broke off the flowers 
                with<br>
                long stems, bent the stalks one round the other, to form links, 
                and<br>
                made first a chain for the neck, then one to go across the<br>
                shoulders, and hang down to the waist, and at last a wreath to 
                wear<br>
                round the head, so that they looked quite splendid in their garlands<br>
                of green stems and golden flowers. But the eldest among them<br>
                gathered carefully the faded flowers, on the stem of which was 
                grouped together the seed, in the form of a white feathery coronal. 
                These loose, airy wool-flowers are very beautiful, and look like 
                fine<br>
                snowy feathers or down. The children held them to their mouths, 
                and<br>
                tried to blow away the whole coronal with one puff of the breath. 
              </p>
              <p>They had been told by their grandmothers that who ever did so 
                would be sure to have new clothes before the end of the year. 
                The despised flower was by this raised to the position of a prophet 
                or foreteller of<br>
                events.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Do you see,&quot; said the sunbeam, &quot;do you see the 
                beauty of these<br>
                flowers? do you see their powers of giving pleasure?&quot;<br>
                &quot;Yes, to children,&quot; said the apple-bough.<br>
              </p>
              <p>By-and-by an old woman came into the field, and, with a blunt<br>
                knife without a handle, began to dig round the roots of some of 
                the<br>
                dandelion-plants, and pull them up. With some of these she intended 
                to make tea for herself; but the rest she was going to sell to 
                the<br>
                chemist, and obtain some money.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But beauty is of higher value than all this,&quot; said 
                the apple-tree<br>
                branch; &quot;only the chosen ones can be admitted into the realms 
                of the<br>
                beautiful. There is a difference between plants, just as there 
                is a<br>
                difference between men.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the sunbeam spoke of the boundless love of God, as seen 
                in<br>
                creation, and over all that lives, and of the equal distribution 
                of<br>
                His gifts, both in time and in eternity.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is your opinion,&quot; said the apple-bough.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then some people came into the room, and, among them, the young<br>
                countess,- the lady who had placed the apple-bough in the<br>
                transparent vase, so pleasantly beneath the rays of the sunlight.<br>
                She carried in her hand something that seemed like a flower. The<br>
                object was hidden by two or three great leaves, which covered 
                it<br>
                like a shield, so that no draught or gust of wind could injure 
                it, and<br>
                it was carried more carefully than the apple-branch had ever been.<br>
                Very cautiously the large leaves were removed, and there appeared<br>
                the feathery seed-crown of the despised dandelion. This was what 
                the<br>
                lady had so carefully plucked, and carried home so safely covered,<br>
                so that not one of the delicate feathery arrows of which its mist-like<br>
                shape was so lightly formed, should flutter away. She now drew 
                it<br>
                forth quite uninjured, and wondered at its beautiful form, and 
                airy<br>
                lightness, and singular construction, so soon to be blown away 
                by<br>
                the wind.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;See,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;how wonderfully God has 
                made this little<br>
                flower. I will paint it with the apple-branch together. Every 
                one<br>
                admires the beauty of the apple-bough; but this humble flower 
                has been endowed by Heaven with another kind of loveliness; and 
                although they differ in appearance, both are the children of the 
                realms of beauty.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the sunbeam kissed the lowly flower, and he kissed the<br>
                blooming apple-branch, upon whose leaves appeared a rosy blush.</p>

              <p  align="center"> FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</p>
              <p class="h" align="center"> TWO BROTHERS</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> ON one of the Danish islands, where old Thingstones, the seats<br>
                of justice of our forefathers, still stand in the cornfields, 
                and huge<br>
                trees rise in the forests of beech, there lies a little town whose 
                low<br>
                houses are covered with red tiles. In one of these houses strange<br>
                things were brewing over the glowing coals on the open hearth; 
                there<br>
                was a boiling going on in glasses, and a mixing and distilling,<br>
                while herbs were being cut up and pounded in mortars. An elderly 
                man looked after it all.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;One must only do the right thing,&quot; he said; &quot;yes, 
                the right-<br>
                the correct thing. One must find out the truth concerning every<br>
                created particle, and keep to that.&quot;<br>
                In the room with the good housewife sat her two sons; they were<br>
                still small, but had great thoughts. Their mother, too, had always<br>
                spoken to them of right and justice, and exhorted them to keep 
                to<br>
                the truth, which she said was the countenance of the Lord in this<br>
                world.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The elder of the boys looked roguish and enterprising. He took 
                a<br>
                delight in reading of the forces of nature, of the sun and the 
                moon;<br>
                no fairy tale pleased him so much. Oh, how beautiful it must be, 
                he<br>
                thought, to go on voyages of discovery, or to find out how to<br>
                imitate the wings of birds and then to be able to fly! Yes, to 
                find<br>
                that out was the right thing. Father was right, and mother was<br>
                right- truth holds the world together.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The younger brother was quieter, and buried himself entirely 
                in<br>
                his books. When he read about Jacob dressing himself in sheep-skins 
                to personify Esau, and so to usurp his brother's birthright, he 
                would<br>
                clench his little fist in anger against the deceiver; when he 
                read<br>
                of tyrants and of the injustice and wickedness of the world, tears<br>
                would come into his eyes, and he was quite filled with the thought<br>
                of the justice and truth which must and would triumph.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One evening he was lying in bed, but the curtains were not yet<br>
                drawn close, and the light streamed in upon him; he had taken 
                his book into bed with him, for he wanted to finish reading the 
                story of Solon.<br>
              </p>
              <p>His thoughts lifted and carried him away a wonderful distance; 
                it<br>
                seemed to him as if the bed had become a ship flying along under<br>
                full sail. Was he dreaming, or what was happening? It glided over<br>
                the rolling waves and across the ocean of time, and to him came 
                the<br>
                voice of Solon; spoken in a strange tongue, yet intelligible to 
                him,<br>
                he heard the Danish motto: &quot;By law the land is ruled.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The genius of the human race stood in the humble room, bent down<br>
                over the bed and imprinted a kiss on the boy's forehead: &quot;Be 
                thou<br>
                strong in fame and strong in the battle of life! With truth in 
                thy<br>
                heart fly toward the land of truth!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The elder brother was not yet in bed; he was standing at the<br>
                window looking out at the mist which rose from the meadows. They<br>
                were not elves dancing out there, as their old nurse had told 
                him;<br>
                he knew better- they were vapours which were warmer than the air,<br>
                and that is why they rose. A shooting star lit up the sky, and 
                the<br>
                boy's thoughts passed in a second from the vapours of the earth 
                up<br>
                to the shining meteor. The stars gleamed in the heavens, and it 
                seemed as if long golden threads hung down from them to the earth.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Fly with me,&quot; sang a voice, which the boy heard in 
                his heart. And<br>
                the mighty genius of mankind, swifter than a bird and than an 
                arrow-<br>
                swifter than anything of earthly origin- carried him out into 
                space,<br>
                where the heavenly bodies are bound together by the rays that 
                pass<br>
                from star to star. Our earth revolved in the thin air, and the<br>
                cities upon it seemed to lie close to each other. Through the<br>
                spheres echoed the words:<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What is near, what is far, when thou art lifted by the 
                mighty<br>
                genius of mind?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And again the boy stood by the window, gazing out, whilst his<br>
                younger brother lay in bed. Their mother called them by their 
                names:<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Anders Sandoe&quot; and &quot;Hans Christian.&quot;<br>
                Denmark and the whole world knows them- the two brothers Oersted.</p>

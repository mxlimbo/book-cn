              <p class="h" align="center"> JACK THE DULLARD<br>
                AN OLD STORY TOLD ANEW</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> FAR in the interior of the country lay an old baronial hall, 
                and<br>
                in it lived an old proprietor, who had two sons, which two young 
                men<br>
                thought themselves too clever by half. They wanted to go out and 
                woo the King's daughter; for the maiden in question had publicly 
                announced that she would choose for her husband that youth who 
                could arrange his words best.<br>
              </p>
              <p>So these two geniuses prepared themselves a full week for the<br>
                wooing- this was the longest time that could be granted them; 
                but it<br>
                was enough, for they had had much preparatory information, and<br>
                everybody knows how useful that is. One of them knew the whole 
                Latin dictionary by heart, and three whole years of the daily 
                paper of the little town into the bargain, and so well, indeed, 
                that he could<br>
                repeat it all either backwards or forwards, just as he chose. 
                The<br>
                other was deeply read in the corporation laws, and knew by heart<br>
                what every corporation ought to know; and accordingly he thought 
                he<br>
                could talk of affairs of state, and put his spoke in the wheel 
                in<br>
                the council. And he knew one thing more: he could embroider suspenders 
                with roses and other flowers, and with arabesques, for he was 
                a tasty, light-fingered fellow.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I shall win the Princess!&quot; So cried both of them. 
                Therefore their<br>
                old papa gave to each of them a handsome horse. The youth who 
                knew the dictionary and newspaper by heart had a black horse, 
                and he who knew all about the corporation laws received a milk-white 
                steed. Then they rubbed the corners of their mouths with fish-oil, 
                so that they might become very smooth and glib. All the servants 
                stood below in the courtyard, and looked on while they mounted 
                their horses; and just by chance the third son came up. For the 
                proprietor had really three sons, though nobody counted the third 
                with his brothers, because he was not so learned as they, and 
                indeed he was generally known as &quot;Jack the Dullard.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Hallo!&quot; said Jack the Dullard, &quot;where are you 
                going? I declare<br>
                you have put on your Sunday clothes!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We're going to the King's court, as suitors to the King's<br>
                daughter. Don't you know the announcement that has been made all<br>
                through the country?&quot; And they told him all about it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;My word! I'll be in it too!&quot; cried Jack the Dullard; 
                and his<br>
                two brothers burst out laughing at him, and rode away.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Father, dear,&quot; said Jack, &quot;I must have a horse 
                too. I do feel<br>
                so desperately inclined to marry! If she accepts me, she accepts 
                me;<br>
                and if she won't have me, I'll have her; but she shall be mine!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Don't talk nonsense,&quot; replied the old gentleman. &quot;You 
                shall<br>
                have no horse from me. You don't know how to speak- you can't<br>
                arrange your words. Your brothers are very different fellows from<br>
                you.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well,&quot; quoth Jack the Dullard, &quot;If I can't have 
                a horse, I'll<br>
                take the Billy-goat, who belongs to me, and he can carry me very<br>
                well!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And so said, so done. He mounted the Billy-goat, pressed his 
                heels<br>
                into its sides, and galloped down the high street like a hurricane.<br>
                &quot;Hei, houp! that was a ride! Here I come!&quot; shouted Jack 
                the<br>
                Dullard, and he sang till his voice echoed far and wide.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But his brothers rode slowly on in advance of him. They spoke<br>
                not a word, for they were thinking about the fine extempore speeches<br>
                they would have to bring out, and these had to be cleverly prepared<br>
                beforehand.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Hallo!&quot; shouted Jack the Dullard. &quot;Here am I! 
                Look what I have<br>
                found on the high road.&quot; And he showed them what it was, 
                and it was<br>
                a dead crow.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Dullard!&quot; exclaimed the brothers, &quot;what are you 
                going to do<br>
                with that?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;With the crow? why, I am going to give it to the Princess.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, do so,&quot; said they; and they laughed, and rode 
                on.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Hallo, here I am again! just see what I have found now: 
                you don't<br>
                find that on the high road every day!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the brothers turned round to see what he could have found 
                now.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Dullard!&quot; they cried, &quot;that is only an old wooden 
                shoe, and the<br>
                upper part is missing into the bargain; are you going to give 
                that<br>
                also to the Princess?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Most certainly I shall,&quot; replied Jack the Dullard; 
                and again<br>
                the brothers laughed and rode on, and thus they got far in advance<br>
                of him; but-<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Hallo- hop rara!&quot; and there was Jack the Dullard again. 
                &quot;It is<br>
                getting better and better,&quot; he cried. &quot;Hurrah! it is 
                quite famous.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why, what have you found this time?&quot; inquired the 
                brothers.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Jack the Dullard, &quot;I can hardly tell 
                you. How glad<br>
                the Princess will be!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Bah!&quot; said the brothers; &quot;that is nothing but 
                clay out of the<br>
                ditch.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, certainly it is,&quot; said Jack the Dullard; &quot;and 
                clay of the<br>
                finest sort. See, it is so wet, it runs through one's fingers.&quot; 
                And he<br>
                filled his pocket with the clay.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But his brothers galloped on till the sparks flew, and<br>
                consequently they arrived a full hour earlier at the town gate 
                than<br>
                could Jack. Now at the gate each suitor was provided with a number,<br>
                and all were placed in rows immediately on their arrival, six 
                in<br>
                each row, and so closely packed together that they could not move<br>
                their arms; and that was a prudent arrangement, for they would<br>
                certainly have come to blows, had they been able, merely because 
                one of them stood before the other.<br>
              </p>
              <p>All the inhabitants of the country round about stood in great<br>
                crowds around the castle, almost under the very windows, to see 
                the<br>
                Princess receive the suitors; and as each stepped into the hall, 
                his<br>
                power of speech seemed to desert him, like the light of a candle<br>
                that is blown out. Then the Princess would say, &quot;He is of 
                no use! Away with him out of the hall!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>At last the turn came for that brother who knew the dictionary<br>
                by heart; but he did not know it now; he had absolutely forgotten 
                it<br>
                altogether; and the boards seemed to re-echo with his footsteps, 
                and<br>
                the ceiling of the hall was made of looking-glass, so that he 
                saw<br>
                himself standing on his head; and at the window stood three clerks 
                and a head clerk, and every one of them was writing down every 
                single word that was uttered, so that it might be printed in the 
                newspapers, and sold for a penny at the street corners. It was 
                a terrible ordeal, and they had, moreover, made such a fire in 
                the stove, that the room seemed quite red hot.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is dreadfully hot here!&quot; observed the first brother.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the Princess, &quot;my father is going 
                to roast young<br>
                pullets today.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Baa!&quot; there he stood like a baa-lamb. He had not been 
                prepared<br>
                for a speech of this kind, and had not a word to say, though he<br>
                intended to say something witty. &quot;Baa!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He is of no use!&quot; said the Princess. &quot;Away with 
                him!&quot;<br>
                And he was obliged to go accordingly. And now the second brother<br>
                came in.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is terribly warm here!&quot; he observed.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, we're roasting pullets to-day,&quot; replied the Princess.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What- what were you- were you pleased to ob-&quot; stammered 
                he- and<br>
                all the clerks wrote down, &quot;pleased to ob-&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He is of no use!&quot; said the Princess. &quot;Away with 
                him!&quot;<br>
                Now came the turn of Jack the Dullard. He rode into the hall on<br>
                his goat.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, it's most abominably hot here.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, because I'm roasting young pullets,&quot; replied 
                the Princess.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah, that's lucky!&quot; exclaimed Jack the Dullard, &quot;for 
                I suppose<br>
                you'll let me roast my crow at the same time?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;With the greatest pleasure,&quot; said the Princess. &quot;But 
                have you<br>
                anything you can roast it in? for I have neither pot nor pan.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Certainly I have!&quot; said Jack. &quot;Here's a cooking 
                utensil with a<br>
                tin handle.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And he brought out the old wooden shoe, and put the crow into 
                it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, that is a famous dish!&quot; said the Princess. &quot;But 
                what<br>
                shall we do for sauce?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, I have that in my pocket,&quot; said Jack; &quot;I 
                have so much of it<br>
                that I can afford to throw some away;&quot; and he poured some 
                of the<br>
                clay out of his pocket.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I like that!&quot; said the Princess. &quot;You can give 
                an answer, and you<br>
                have something to say for yourself, and so you shall be my husband.<br>
                But are you aware that every word we speak is being taken down, 
                and<br>
                will be published in the paper to-morrow? Look yonder, and you 
                will<br>
                see in every window three clerks and a head clerk; and the old 
                head<br>
                clerk is the worst of all, for he can't understand anything.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But she only said this to frighten Jack the Dullard; and the<br>
                clerks gave a great crow of delight, and each one spurted a blot 
                out<br>
                of his pen on to the floor.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, those are the gentlemen, are they?&quot; said Jack; 
                &quot;then I will<br>
                give the best I have to the head clerk.&quot; And he turned out 
                his<br>
                pockets, and flung the wet clay full in the head clerk's face.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That was very cleverly done,&quot; observed the Princess. 
                &quot;I could not<br>
                have done that; but I shall learn in time.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And accordingly Jack the Dullard was made a king, and received 
                a<br>
                crown and a wife, and sat upon a throne. And this report we have 
                wet<br>
                from the press of the head clerk and the corporation of printers-<br>
                but they are not to be depended upon in the least.</p>

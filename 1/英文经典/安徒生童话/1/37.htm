              <p class="h" align="center"> THE BOTTLE NECK</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> CLOSE to the corner of a street, among other abodes of poverty,<br>
                stood an exceedingly tall, narrow house, which had been so knocked<br>
                about by time that it seemed out of joint in every direction. 
                This<br>
                house was inhabited by poor people, but the deepest poverty was<br>
                apparent in the garret lodging in the gable. In front of the little<br>
                window, an old bent bird-cage hung in the sunshine, which had 
                not even a proper water-glass, but instead of it the broken neck 
                of a bottle, turned upside down, and a cork stuck in to make it 
                hold the water with which it was filled. An old maid stood at 
                the window; she had hung chickweed over the cage, and the little 
                linnet which it contained hopped from perch to perch and sang 
                and twittered merrily.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, it's all very well for you to sing,&quot; said the 
                bottle neck:<br>
                that is, he did not really speak the words as we do, for the neck 
                of a<br>
                bottle cannot speak; but he thought them to himself in his own 
                mind,<br>
                just as people sometimes talk quietly to themselves.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, you may sing very well, you have all your limbs uninjured;<br>
                you should feel what it is like to lose your body, and only have 
                a<br>
                neck and a mouth left, with a cork stuck in it, as I have: you<br>
                wouldn't sing then, I know. After all, it is just as well that 
                there<br>
                are some who can be happy. I have no reason to sing, nor could 
                I<br>
                sing now if I were ever so happy; but when I was a whole bottle, 
                and<br>
                they rubbed me with a cork, didn't I sing then? I used to be called<br>
                a complete lark. I remember when I went out to a picnic with the<br>
                furrier's family, on the day his daughter was betrothed,- it seems<br>
                as if it only happened yesterday. I have gone through a great 
                deal<br>
                in my time, when I come to recollect: I have been in the fire 
                and in<br>
                the water, I have been deep in the earth, and have mounted higher 
                in<br>
                the air than most other people, and now I am swinging here, outside<br>
                a bird-cage, in the air and the sunshine. Oh, indeed, it would 
                be<br>
                worth while to hear my history; but I do not speak it aloud, for 
                a<br>
                good reason- because I cannot.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the bottle neck related his history, which was really<br>
                rather remarkable; he, in fact, related it to himself, or, at 
                least,<br>
                thought it in his own mind. The little bird sang his own song 
                merrily;<br>
                in the street below there was driving and running to and fro, 
                every<br>
                one thought of his own affairs, or perhaps of nothing at all; 
                but<br>
                the bottle neck thought deeply. He thought of the blazing furnace 
                in<br>
                the factory, where he had been blown into life; he remembered 
                how<br>
                hot it felt when he was placed in the heated oven, the home from 
                which he sprang, and that he had a strong inclination to leap 
                out again<br>
                directly; but after a while it became cooler, and he found himself<br>
                very comfortable. He had been placed in a row, with a whole regiment<br>
                of his brothers and sisters all brought out of the same furnace;<br>
                some of them had certainly been blown into champagne bottles, 
                and<br>
                others into beer bottles, which made a little difference between 
                them.<br>
                In the world it often happens that a beer bottle may contain the<br>
                most precious wine, and a champagne bottle be filled with blacking,<br>
                but even in decay it may always be seen whether a man has been 
                well<br>
                born. Nobility remains noble, as a champagne bottle remains the<br>
                same, even with blacking in its interior. When the bottles were 
                packed<br>
                our bottle was packed amongst them; it little expected then to<br>
                finish its career as a bottle neck, or to be used as a water-glass<br>
                to a bird's-cage, which is, after all, a place of honor, for it 
                is<br>
                to be of some use in the world. The bottle did not behold the 
                light of<br>
                day again, until it was unpacked with the rest in the wine merchant's 
                cellar, and, for the first time, rinsed with water, which caused 
                some very curious sensations. There it lay empty, and without 
                a cork, and it had a peculiar feeling, as if it wanted something 
                it knew not what. At last it was filled with rich and costly wine, 
                a cork was placed in it, and sealed down. Then it was labelled 
                &quot;first quality,&quot; as if it had carried off the first 
                prize at an examination; besides, the wine and the bottle were 
                both good, and while we are young is the time for poetry. There 
                were sounds of song within the bottle, of things it could not 
                understand, of green sunny mountains, where the vines grow and 
                where the merry vine-dressers laugh, sing, and are merry. &quot;Ah, 
                how beautiful is life.&quot; All these tones of joy and song in 
                the bottle were like the working of a young poet's brain, who 
                often knows not the meaning of the tones which are sounding within 
                him. </p>
              <p>One morning the bottle found a purchaser in the furrier's apprentice, 
                who was told to bring one of the best bottles of wine. It was 
                placed in the provision basket with ham and cheese and sausages. 
                The sweetest fresh butter and the finest bread were put into the 
                basket by the furrier's daughter herself, for she packed it. She 
                was young and pretty; her brown eyes laughed, and a smile lingered 
                round her mouth as sweet as that in her eyes. She had delicate 
                hands, beautifully white, and her neck was whiter still. It could 
                easily be seen that she was a very lovely girl, and as yet she 
                was not engaged. The provision basket lay in the lap of the young 
                girl as the family drove out to the forest, and the neck of the 
                bottle peeped out from between the folds of the white napkin. 
                There was the red wax on the cork, and the bottle looked straight 
                at the young girl's face, and also at the face of the young sailor 
                who sat near her. He was a young friend, the son of a portrait 
                painter. He had lately passed his examination with honor, as mate, 
                and the next morning he was to sail in his ship to a distant coast. 
                There had been a great deal of talk on this subject while the 
                basket was being packed, and during this conversation the eyes 
                and the mouth of the furrier's daughter did not wear a very joyful 
                expression. The young people wandered away into the green wood, 
                and talked together. What did they talk about? The bottle could 
                not say, for he was in the provision basket. It remained there 
                a long time; but when at last it was brought forth it appeared 
                as if something pleasant had happened, for every one was laughing; 
                the furrier's daughter laughed too, but she said very little, 
                and her cheeks were like two roses. Then her father took the bottle 
                and the cork-screw into his hands. What a strange sensation it 
                was to have the cork drawn for the first time! The bottle could 
                never after that forget the performance of that moment; indeed 
                there was quite a convulsion within him as the cork flew out, 
                and a gurgling sound as the wine was poured forth into the glasses.</p>
              <p> &quot;Long life to the betrothed,&quot; cried the papa, and 
                every glass<br>
                was emptied to the dregs, while the young sailor kissed his<br>
                beautiful bride.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Happiness and blessing to you both,&quot; said the old 
                people-father<br>
                and mother, and the young man filled the glasses again.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Safe return, and a wedding this day next year,&quot; he 
                cried; and<br>
                when the glasses were empty he took the bottle, raised it on high, 
                and<br>
                said, &quot;Thou hast been present here on the happiest day of 
                my life;<br>
                thou shalt never be used by others!&quot; So saying, he hurled 
                it high in<br>
                the air.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The furrier's daughter thought she should never see it again,<br>
                but she was mistaken. It fell among the rushes on the borders 
                of a<br>
                little woodland lake. The bottle neck remembered well how long 
                it<br>
                lay there unseen. &quot;I gave them wine, and they gave me muddy 
                water,&quot; he had said to himself, &quot;but I suppose it was 
                all well meant.&quot; He could no longer see the betrothed couple, 
                nor the cheerful old people; but for a long time he could hear 
                them rejoicing and singing. At length<br>
                there came by two peasant boys, who peeped in among the reeds 
                and<br>
                spied out the bottle. Then they took it up and carried it home 
                with<br>
                them, so that once more it was provided for. At home in their 
                wooden cottage these boys had an elder brother, a sailor, who 
                was about to start on a long voyage. He had been there the day 
                before to say farewell, and his mother was now very busy packing 
                up various things for him to take with him on his voyage. In the 
                evening his father<br>
                was going to carry the parcel to the town to see his son once 
                more,<br>
                and take him a farewell greeting from his mother. A small bottle 
                had<br>
                already been filled with herb tea, mixed with brandy, and wrapped 
                in a<br>
                parcel; but when the boys came in they brought with them a larger<br>
                and stronger bottle, which they had found. This bottle would hold 
                so<br>
                much more than the little one, and they all said the brandy would 
                be<br>
                so good for complaints of the stomach, especially as it was mixed 
                with medical herbs. The liquid which they now poured into the 
                bottle was not like the red wine with which it had once been filled; 
                these were bitter drops, but they are of great use sometimes-for 
                the stomach. The new large bottle was to go, not the little one: 
                so the bottle once more started on its travels. It was taken on 
                board (for Peter Jensen was one of the crew) the very same ship 
                in which the young mate was to sail. But the mate did not see 
                the bottle: indeed, if he had he would not have known it, or supposed 
                it was the one out of which they had drunk to the felicity of 
                the betrothed and to the prospect of a marriage on his own happy 
                return. Certainly the bottle no longer poured forth wine, but 
                it contained something quite as good; and so it happened that 
                whenever Peter Jensen brought it out, his messmates gave it the 
                name of &quot;the apothecary,&quot; for it contained the best 
                medicine to cure the stomach, and he gave it out quite willingly 
                as long as a drop remained. Those were happy days, and the bottle 
                would sing when rubbed with a cork, and it was called a great 
                lark,&quot; &quot;Peter Jensen's lark.&quot; Long days and months 
                rolled by, during which the bottle stood empty in a corner, when 
                a storm arose- whether on the passage out or home it could not 
                tell, for it had never been ashore. It was a terrible storm, great 
                waves arose, darkly heaving and tossing the vessel to and fro. 
                The main mast was split asunder, the ship sprang a leak, and the 
                pumps became useless, while all around was black as night. At 
                the last moment, when the ship was sinking, the young mate wrote 
                on a piece of paper, &quot;We are going down: God's will be done.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then he wrote the name of his betrothed, his own name, and that 
                of the ship. Then he put the leaf in an empty bottle that happened 
                to be at hand, corked it down tightly, and threw it into the foaming 
                sea. He<br>
                knew not that it was the very same bottle from which the goblet 
                of joy<br>
                and hope had once been filled for him, and now it was tossing 
                on the<br>
                waves with his last greeting, and a message from the dead. The 
                ship<br>
                sank, and the crew sank with her; but the bottle flew on like 
                a<br>
                bird, for it bore within it a loving letter from a loving heart. 
                And<br>
                as the sun rose and set, the bottle felt as at the time of its 
                first<br>
                existence, when in the heated glowing stove it had a longing to 
                fly<br>
                away. It outlived the storms and the calm, it struck against no 
                rocks,<br>
                was not devoured by sharks, but drifted on for more than a year,<br>
                sometimes towards the north, sometimes towards the south, just 
                as<br>
                the current carried it. It was in all other ways its own master, 
                but<br>
                even of that one may get tired. The written leaf, the last farewell 
                of<br>
                the bridegroom to his bride, would only bring sorrow when once 
                it<br>
                reached her hands; but where were those hands, so soft and delicate,<br>
                which had once spread the table-cloth on the fresh grass in the<br>
                green wood, on the day of her betrothal? Ah, yes! where was the<br>
                furrier's daughter? and where was the land which might lie nearest<br>
                to her home?<br>
              </p>
              <p>The bottle knew not, it travelled onward and onward, and at last<br>
                all this wandering about became wearisome; at all events it was 
                not<br>
                its usual occupation. But it had to travel, till at length it<br>
                reached land- a foreign country. Not a word spoken in this country<br>
                could the bottle understand; it was a language it had never before<br>
                heard, and it is a great loss not to be able to understand a language.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The bottle was fished out of the water, and examined on all sides. 
              </p>
              <p>The little letter contained within it was discovered, taken out, 
                and<br>
                turned and twisted in every direction; but the people could not<br>
                understand what was written upon it. They could be quite sure 
                that the bottle had been thrown overboard from a vessel, and that 
                something about it was written on this paper: but what was written? 
                that was the question,- so the paper was put back into the bottle, 
                and then both were put away in a large cupboard of one of the 
                great houses of the town. Whenever any strangers arrived, the 
                paper was taken out and turned over and over, so that the address, 
                which was only written in pencil, became almost illegible, and 
                at last no one could distinguish any letters on it at all. For 
                a whole year the bottle<br>
                remained standing in the cupboard, and then it was taken up to 
                the<br>
                loft, where it soon became covered with dust and cobwebs. Ah! 
                how<br>
                often then it thought of those better days- of the times when 
                in the<br>
                fresh, green wood, it had poured forth rich wine; or, while rocked<br>
                by the swelling waves, it had carried in its bosom a secret, a 
                letter,<br>
                a last parting sigh. For full twenty years it stood in the loft, 
                and<br>
                it might have stayed there longer but that the house was going 
                to be<br>
                rebuilt. The bottle was discovered when the roof was taken off; 
                they<br>
                talked about it, but the bottle did not understand what they said- 
                a<br>
                language is not to be learnt by living in a loft, even for twenty<br>
                years. &quot;If I had been down stairs in the room,&quot; thought 
                the bottle, &quot;I<br>
                might have learnt it.&quot; It was now washed and rinsed, which 
                process was really quite necessary, and afterwards it looked clean 
                and<br>
                transparent, and felt young again in its old age; but the paper<br>
                which it had carried so faithfully was destroyed in the washing.<br>
                They filled the bottle with seeds, though it scarcely knew what 
                had<br>
                been placed in it. Then they corked it down tightly, and carefully<br>
                wrapped it up. There not even the light of a torch or lantern 
                could<br>
                reach it, much less the brightness of the sun or moon. &quot;And 
                yet,&quot;<br>
                thought the bottle, &quot;men go on a journey that they may see 
                as much<br>
                as possible, and I can see nothing.&quot; However, it did something 
                quite<br>
                as important; it travelled to the place of its destination, and 
                was<br>
                unpacked.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What trouble they have taken with that bottle over yonder!&quot;<br>
                said one, and very likely it is broken after all.&quot; But the 
                bottle<br>
                was not broken, and, better still, it understood every word that 
                was<br>
                said: this language it had heard at the furnaces and at the wine<br>
                merchant's; in the forest and on the ship,- it was the only good 
                old<br>
                language it could understand. It had returned home, and the language<br>
                was as a welcome greeting. For very joy, it felt ready to jump 
                out<br>
                of people's hands, and scarcely noticed that its cork had been<br>
                drawn, and its contents emptied out, till it found itself carried 
                to a<br>
                cellar, to be left there and forgotten. &quot;There's no place 
                like home,<br>
                even if it's a cellar.&quot; It never occurred to him to think 
                that he<br>
                might lie there for years, he felt so comfortable. For many long 
                years<br>
                he remained in the cellar, till at last some people came to carry 
                away<br>
                the bottles, and ours amongst the number.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Out in the garden there was a great festival. Brilliant lamps 
                hung<br>
                in festoons from tree to tree; and paper lanterns, through which 
                the<br>
                light shone till they looked like transparent tulips. It was a 
                beautiful evening, and the weather mild and clear. The stars twinkled;<br>
                and the new moon, in the form of a crescent, was surrounded by 
                the<br>
                shadowy disc of the whole moon, and looked like a gray globe with 
                a<br>
                golden rim: it was a beautiful sight for those who had good eyes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The illumination extended even to the most retired of the garden<br>
                walks, at least not so retired that any one need lose himself 
                there.<br>
                In the borders were placed bottles, each containing a light, and 
                among<br>
                them the bottle with which we are acquainted, and whose fate it 
                was,<br>
                one day, to be only a bottle neck, and to serve as a water-glass 
                to<br>
                a bird's-cage. Everything here appeared lovely to our bottle, 
                for it<br>
                was again in the green wood, amid joy and feasting; again it heard<br>
                music and song, and the noise and murmur of a crowd, especially 
                in<br>
                that part of the garden where the lamps blazed, and the paper 
                lanterns<br>
                displayed their brilliant colors. It stood in a distant walk certainly, 
                but a place pleasant for contemplation; and it carried a light; 
                and was at once useful and ornamental. In such an hour it is easy 
                to forget that one has spent twenty years in a loft, and a good 
                thing it is to be able to do so. Close before the bottle passed 
                a single pair, like the bridal pair- the mate and the furrier's 
                daughter- who had so long ago wandered in the wood. It seemed 
                to the bottle as if he were living that time over again. Not only 
                the guests but other people were walking in the garden, who were 
                allowed to witness the splendor and the festivities. Among the 
                latter came an old maid, who seemed to be quite alone in the world. 
                She was thinking, like the bottle, of the green wood, and of a 
                young betrothed pair, who were closely connected with herself; 
                she was thinking of that hour, the happiest of her life, in which 
                she had taken part, when she had herself been one of that betrothed 
                pair; such hours are never to be forgotten, let a maiden be as 
                old as she may. But she did not recognize the bottle, neither 
                did the bottle notice the old maid. And so we often pass each 
                other in the world when we meet, as did these two, even while 
                together in the same town.</p>
              <p> The bottle was taken from the garden, and again sent to a wine<br>
                merchant, where it was once more filled with wine, and sold to 
                an<br>
                aeronaut, who was to make an ascent in his balloon on the following<br>
                Sunday. A great crowd assembled to witness the sight; military 
                music<br>
                had been engaged, and many other preparations made. The bottle 
                saw<br>
                it all from the basket in which he lay close to a live rabbit. 
                The<br>
                rabbit was quite excited because he knew that he was to be taken 
                up,<br>
                and let down again in a parachute. The bottle, however, knew nothing<br>
                of the &quot;up,&quot; or the &quot;down;&quot; he saw only that 
                the balloon was<br>
                swelling larger and larger till it could swell no more, and began 
                to<br>
                rise and be restless. Then the ropes which held it were cut through,<br>
                and the aerial ship rose in the air with the aeronaut and the 
                basket<br>
                containing the bottle and the rabbit, while the music sounded 
                and<br>
                all the people shouted &quot;Hurrah.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This is a wonderful journey up into the air,&quot; thought 
                the bottle;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;it is a new way of sailing, and here, at least, there is 
                no fear of<br>
                striking against anything.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Thousands of people gazed at the balloon, and the old maid who 
                was<br>
                in the garden saw it also; for she stood at the open window of 
                the<br>
                garret, by which hung the cage containing the linnet, who then 
                had<br>
                no water-glass, but was obliged to be contented with an old cup. 
                In<br>
                the window-sill stood a myrtle in a pot, and this had been pushed 
                a<br>
                little on one side, that it might not fall out; for the old maid 
                was<br>
                leaning out of the window, that she might see. And she did see<br>
                distinctly the aeronaut in the balloon, and how he let down the 
                rabbit<br>
                in the parachute, and then drank to the health of all the spectators<br>
                in the wine from the bottle. After doing this, he hurled it high<br>
                into the air. How little she thought that this was the very same<br>
                bottle which her friend had thrown aloft in her honor, on that 
                happy<br>
                day of rejoicing, in the green wood, in her youthful days. The<br>
                bottle had no time to think, when raised so suddenly; and before 
                it<br>
                was aware, it reached the highest point it had ever attained in 
                its<br>
                life. Steeples and roofs lay far, far beneath it, and the people<br>
                looked as tiny as possible. Then it began to descend much more 
                rapidly than the rabbit had done, made somersaults in the air, 
                and felt itself quite young and unfettered, although it was half 
                full of wine. But<br>
                this did not last long. What a journey it was! All the people 
                could<br>
                see the bottle; for the sun shone upon it. The balloon was already 
                far<br>
                away, and very soon the bottle was far away also; for it fell 
                upon a<br>
                roof, and broke in pieces. But the pieces had got such an impetus 
                in<br>
                them, that they could not stop themselves. They went jumping and<br>
                rolling about, till at last they fell into the court-yard, and 
                were<br>
                broken into still smaller pieces; only the neck of the bottle<br>
                managed to keep whole, and it was broken off as clean as if it 
                had<br>
                been cut with a diamond.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That would make a capital bird's glass,&quot; said one 
                of the<br>
                cellar-men; but none of them had either a bird or a cage, and 
                it was<br>
                not to be expected they would provide one just because they had<br>
                found a bottle neck that could be used as a glass. But the old 
                maid<br>
                who lived in the garret had a bird, and it really might be useful 
                to<br>
                her; so the bottle neck was provided with a cork, and taken up 
                to her;<br>
                and, as it often happens in life, the part that had been uppermost 
                was<br>
                now turned downwards, and it was filled with fresh water. Then 
                they<br>
                hung it in the cage of the little bird, who sang and twittered 
                more<br>
                merrily than ever.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah, you have good reason to sing,&quot; said the bottle 
                neck, which<br>
                was looked upon as something very remarkable, because it had been 
                in a balloon; nothing further was known of its history. As it 
                hung there in the bird's-cage, it could hear the noise and murmur 
                of the people in<br>
                the street below, as well as the conversation of the old maid 
                in the<br>
                room within. An old friend had just come to visit her, and they<br>
                talked, not about the bottle neck, but of the myrtle in the window.<br>
                &quot;No, you must not spend a dollar for your daughter's bridal<br>
                bouquet,&quot; said the old maid; &quot;you shall have a beautiful 
                little<br>
                bunch for a nosegay, full of blossoms. Do you see how splendidly 
                the tree has grown? It has been raised from only a little sprig 
                of<br>
                myrtle that you gave me on the day after my betrothal, and from<br>
                which I was to make my own bridal bouquet when a year had passed:<br>
                but that day never came; the eyes were closed which were to have<br>
                been my light and joy through life. In the depths of the sea my<br>
                beloved sleeps sweetly; the myrtle has become an old tree, and 
                I am<br>
                a still older woman. Before the sprig you gave me faded, I took 
                a<br>
                spray, and planted it in the earth; and now, as you see, it has 
                become<br>
                a large tree, and a bunch of the blossoms shall at last appear 
                at a<br>
                wedding festival, in the bouquet of your daughter.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>There were tears in the eyes of the old maid, as she spoke of<br>
                the beloved of her youth, and of their betrothal in the wood. 
                Many<br>
                thoughts came into her mind; but the thought never came, that 
                quite<br>
                close to her, in that very window, was a remembrance of those 
                olden<br>
                times,- the neck of the bottle which had, as it were shouted for 
                joy<br>
                when the cork flew out with a bang on the betrothal day. But the<br>
                bottle neck did not recognize the old maid; he had not been<br>
                listening to what she had related, perhaps because he was thinking<br>
                so much about her.</p>

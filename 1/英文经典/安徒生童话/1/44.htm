              <p class="h" align="center"> THE DARNING-NEEDLE</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THERE was once a darning-needle who thought herself so fine 
                that<br>
                she fancied she must be fit for embroidery. &quot;Hold me tight,&quot; 
                she would say to the fingers, when they took her up, &quot;don't 
                let me fall; if<br>
                you do I shall never be found again, I am so very fine.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is your opinion, is it?&quot; said the fingers, as 
                they seized<br>
                her round the body.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;See, I am coming with a train,&quot; said the darning-needle,<br>
                drawing a long thread after her; but there was no knot in the 
                thread.<br>
                The fingers then placed the point of the needle against the cook's<br>
                slipper. There was a crack in the upper leather, which had to 
                be<br>
                sewn together.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What coarse work!&quot; said the darning-needle, &quot;I 
                shall never get<br>
                through. I shall break!- I am breaking!&quot; and sure enough 
                she broke.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Did I not say so?&quot; said the darning-needle, &quot;I 
                know I am too fine for<br>
                such work as that.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This needle is quite useless for sewing now,&quot; said 
                the fingers;<br>
                but they still held it fast, and the cook dropped some sealing-wax<br>
                on the needle, and fastened her handkerchief with it in front.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;So now I am a breast-pin,&quot; said the darning-needle; 
                &quot;I knew<br>
                very well I should come to honor some day: merit is sure to rise;&quot; 
                and<br>
                she laughed, quietly to herself, for of course no one ever saw 
                a<br>
                darning-needle laugh. And there she sat as proudly as if she were 
                in a<br>
                state coach, and looked all around her. &quot;May I be allowed 
                to ask if<br>
                you are made of gold?&quot; she inquired of her neighbor, a pin; 
                &quot;you<br>
                have a very pretty appearance, and a curious head, although you 
                are<br>
                rather small. You must take pains to grow, for it is not every 
                one who<br>
                has sealing-wax dropped upon him;&quot; and as she spoke, the<br>
                darning-needle drew herself up so proudly that she fell out of 
                the<br>
                handkerchief right into the sink, which the cook was cleaning. 
                &quot;Now<br>
                I am going on a journey,&quot; said the needle, as she floated 
                away with<br>
                the dirty water, &quot;I do hope I shall not be lost.&quot; But 
                she really was<br>
                lost in a gutter. &quot;I am too fine for this world,&quot; said 
                the<br>
                darning-needle, as she lay in the gutter; &quot;but I know who 
                I am, and<br>
                that is always some comfort.&quot; So the darning-needle kept 
                up her<br>
                proud behavior, and did not lose her good humor. Then there floated<br>
                over her all sorts of things,- chips and straws, and pieces of 
                old<br>
                newspaper. &quot;See how they sail,&quot; said the darning-needle; 
                &quot;they do<br>
                not know what is under them. I am here, and here I shall stick. 
                See,<br>
                there goes a chip, thinking of nothing in the world but himself-<br>
                only a chip. There's a straw going by now; how he turns and twists<br>
                about! Don't be thinking too much of yourself, or you may chance 
                to<br>
                run against a stone. There swims a piece of newspaper; what is 
                written upon it has been forgotten long ago, and yet it gives 
                itself airs. I sit here patiently and quietly. I know who I am, 
                so I shall not move.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>One day something lying close to the darning-needle glittered 
                so<br>
                splendidly that she thought it was a diamond; yet it was only 
                a<br>
                piece of broken bottle. The darning-needle spoke to it, because 
                it<br>
                sparkled, and represented herself as a breast-pin. &quot;I suppose 
                you<br>
                are really a diamond?&quot; she said.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why yes, something of the kind,&quot; he replied; and so 
                each believed<br>
                the other to be very valuable, and then they began to talk about 
                the<br>
                world, and the conceited people in it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I have been in a lady's work-box,&quot; said the darning-needle,<br>
                &quot;and this lady was the cook. She had on each hand five fingers, 
                and<br>
                anything so conceited as these five fingers I have never seen; 
                and yet<br>
                they were only employed to take me out of the box and to put me 
                back again.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Were they not high-born?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;High-born!&quot; said the darning-needle, &quot;no indeed, 
                but so<br>
                haughty. They were five brothers, all born fingers; they kept 
                very<br>
                proudly together, though they were of different lengths. The one 
                who<br>
                stood first in the rank was named the thumb, he was short and 
                thick,<br>
                and had only one joint in his back, and could therefore make but 
                one<br>
                bow; but he said that if he were cut off from a man's hand, that 
                man<br>
                would be unfit for a soldier. Sweet-tooth, his neighbor, dipped<br>
                himself into sweet or sour, pointed to the sun and moon, and formed<br>
                the letters when the fingers wrote. Longman, the middle finger, 
                looked<br>
                over the heads of all the others. Gold-band, the next finger, 
                wore a<br>
                golden circle round his waist. And little Playman did nothing 
                at<br>
                all, and seemed proud of it. They were boasters, and boasters 
                they<br>
                will remain; and therefore I left them.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And now we sit here and glitter,&quot; said the piece of 
                broken bottle.<br>
              </p>
              <p>At the same moment more water streamed into the gutter, so that 
                it<br>
                overflowed, and the piece of bottle was carried away.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;So he is promoted,&quot; said the darning-needle, &quot;while 
                I remain<br>
                here; I am too fine, but that is my pride, and what do I care?&quot; 
                And so<br>
                she sat there in her pride, and had many such thoughts as these,- 
                &quot;I<br>
                could almost fancy that I came from a sunbeam, I am so fine. It<br>
                seems as if the sunbeams were always looking for me under the 
                water.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Ah! I am so fine that even my mother cannot find me. Had I still 
                my<br>
                old eye, which was broken off, I believe I should weep; but no, 
                I<br>
                would not do that, it is not genteel to cry.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>One day a couple of street boys were paddling in the gutter, 
                for<br>
                they sometimes found old nails, farthings, and other treasures. 
                It was<br>
                dirty work, but they took great pleasure in it. &quot;Hallo!&quot; 
                cried one, as<br>
                he pricked himself with the darning-needle, &quot;here's a fellow 
                for you.&quot;<br>
                &quot;I am not a fellow, I am a young lady,&quot; said the darning-needle;<br>
                but no one heard her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The sealing-wax had come off, and she was quite black; but black<br>
                makes a person look slender, so she thought herself even finer 
                than<br>
                before.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Here comes an egg-shell sailing along,&quot; said one of 
                the boys;<br>
                so they stuck the darning-needle into the egg-shell.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;White walls, and I am black myself,&quot; said the darning-needle,<br>
                &quot;that looks well; now I can be seen, but I hope I shall not 
                be<br>
                sea-sick, or I shall break again.&quot; She was not sea-sick, 
                and she did<br>
                not break. &quot;It is a good thing against sea-sickness to have 
                a steel<br>
                stomach, and not to forget one's own importance. Now my sea-sickness 
                has past: delicate people can bear a great deal.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Crack went the egg-shell, as a waggon passed over it. &quot;Good<br>
                heavens, how it crushes!&quot; said the darning-needle. &quot;I 
                shall be sick<br>
                now. I am breaking!&quot; but she did not break, though the waggon 
                went<br>
                over her as she lay at full length; and there let her lie.</p>

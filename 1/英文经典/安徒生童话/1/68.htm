              <p class="h" align="center"> THE LOVELIEST ROSE IN THE WORLD</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THERE lived once a great queen, in whose garden were found at<br>
                all seasons the most splendid flowers, and from every land in 
                the<br>
                world. She specially loved roses, and therefore she possessed 
                the most beautiful varieties of this flower, from the wild hedge-rose, 
                with its apple-scented leaves, to the splendid Provence rose. 
                They grew near the shelter of the walls, wound themselves round 
                columns and<br>
                window-frames, crept along passages and over the ceilings of the<br>
                halls. They were of every fragrance and color.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But care and sorrow dwelt within these halls; the queen lay upon 
                a<br>
                sick bed, and the doctors declared that she must die. &quot;There 
                is<br>
                still one thing that could save her,&quot; said one of the wisest 
                among<br>
                them. &quot;Bring her the loveliest rose in the world; one which 
                exhibits<br>
                the purest and brightest love, and if it is brought to her before<br>
                her eyes close, she will not die.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then from all parts came those who brought roses that bloomed 
                in<br>
                every garden, but they were not the right sort. The flower must 
                be one<br>
                from the garden of love; but which of the roses there showed forth 
                the highest and purest love? The poets sang of this rose, the 
                loveliest in the world, and each named one which he considered 
                worthy of that<br>
                title; and intelligence of what was required was sent far and 
                wide<br>
                to every heart that beat with love; to every class, age, and<br>
                condition.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No one has yet named the flower,&quot; said the wise man. 
                &quot;No one<br>
                has pointed out the spot where it blooms in all its splendor. 
                It is<br>
                not a rose from the coffin of Romeo and Juliet, or from the grave 
                of<br>
                Walburg, though these roses will live in everlasting song. It 
                is not<br>
                one of the roses which sprouted forth from the blood-stained fame 
                of<br>
                Winkelreid. The blood which flows from the breast of a hero who 
                dies for his country is sacred, and his memory is sweet, and no 
                rose can be redder than the blood which flows from his veins. 
                Neither is it the magic flower of Science, to obtain which wondrous 
                flower a man devotes many an hour of his fresh young life in sleepless 
                nights, in a<br>
                lonely chamber.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I know where it blooms,&quot; said a happy mother, who 
                came with her<br>
                lovely child to the bedside of the queen. &quot;I know where the<br>
                loveliest rose in the world is. It is seen on the blooming cheeks 
                of<br>
                my sweet child, when it expresses the pure and holy love of infancy;<br>
                when refreshed by sleep it opens its eyes, and smiles upon me 
                with<br>
                childlike affection.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This is a lovely rose,&quot; said the wise man; &quot;but 
                there is one<br>
                still more lovely.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, one far more lovely,&quot; said one of the women. 
                &quot;I have seen<br>
                it, and a loftier and purer rose does not bloom. But it was white,<br>
                like the leaves of a blush-rose. I saw it on the cheeks of the<br>
                queen. She had taken off her golden crown, and through the long,<br>
                dreary night, she carried her sick child in her arms. She wept 
                over<br>
                it, kissed it, and prayed for it as only a mother can pray in 
                that<br>
                hour of her anguish.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Holy and wonderful in its might is the white rose of grief, 
                but<br>
                it is not the one we seek.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No; the loveliest rose in the world I saw at the Lord's 
                table,&quot;<br>
                said the good old bishop. &quot;I saw it shine as if an angel's 
                face had<br>
                appeared. A young maiden knelt at the altar, and renewed the vows 
                made at her baptism; and there were white roses and red roses 
                on the<br>
                blushing cheeks of that young girl. She looked up to heaven with 
                all<br>
                the purity and love of her young spirit, in all the expression 
                of<br>
                the highest and purest love.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;May she be blessed!&quot; said the wise man: &quot;but 
                no one has yet named<br>
                the loveliest rose in the world.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then there came into the room a child- the queen's little son.<br>
                Tears stood in his eyes, and glistened on his cheeks; he carried 
                a<br>
                great book and the binding was of velvet, with silver clasps.<br>
                &quot;Mother,&quot; cried the little boy; &quot;only hear what 
                I have read.&quot; And<br>
                the child seated himself by the bedside, and read from the book 
                of Him who suffered death on the cross to save all men, even who 
                are yet unborn. He read, &quot;Greater love hath no man than this,&quot; 
                and as he<br>
                read a roseate hue spread over the cheeks of the queen, and her 
                eyes<br>
                became so enlightened and clear, that she saw from the leaves 
                of the<br>
                book a lovely rose spring forth, a type of Him who shed His blood 
                on the cross.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I see it,&quot; she said. &quot;He who beholds this, the 
                loveliest rose<br>
                on earth, shall never die.&quot;</p>

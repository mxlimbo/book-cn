              <p class="h" align="center"> THE BUTTERFLY</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THERE was once a butterfly who wished for a bride, and, as may<br>
                be supposed, he wanted to choose a very pretty one from among 
                the<br>
                flowers. He glanced, with a very critical eye, at all the flower-beds,<br>
                and found that the flowers were seated quietly and demurely on 
                their<br>
                stalks, just as maidens should sit before they are engaged; but<br>
                there was a great number of them, and it appeared as if his search<br>
                would become very wearisome. The butterfly did not like to take 
                too<br>
                much trouble, so he flew off on a visit to the daisies. The French<br>
                call this flower &quot;Marguerite,&quot; and they say that the 
                little daisy<br>
                can prophesy. Lovers pluck off the leaves, and as they pluck each<br>
                leaf, they ask a question about their lovers; thus: &quot;Does 
                he or she<br>
                love me?- Ardently? Distractedly? Very much? A little? Not at 
                all?&quot;<br>
                and so on. Every one speaks these words in his own language. The<br>
                butterfly came also to Marguerite to inquire, but he did not pluck 
                off<br>
                her leaves; he pressed a kiss on each of them, for he thought 
                there<br>
                was always more to be done by kindness.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Darling Marguerite daisy,&quot; he said to her, &quot;you 
                are the wisest<br>
                woman of all the flowers. Pray tell me which of the flowers I 
                shall<br>
                choose for my wife. Which will be my bride? When I know, I will 
                fly<br>
                directly to her, and propose.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But Marguerite did not answer him; she was offended that he should<br>
                call her a woman when she was only a girl; and there is a great<br>
                difference. He asked her a second time, and then a third; but 
                she<br>
                remained dumb, and answered not a word. Then he would wait no<br>
                longer, but flew away, to commence his wooing at once. It was 
                in the<br>
                early spring, when the crocus and the snowdrop were in full bloom.<br>
                &quot;They are very pretty,&quot; thought the butterfly; &quot;charming 
                little<br>
                lasses; but they are rather formal.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then, as the young lads often do, he looked out for the elder<br>
                girls. He next flew to the anemones; these were rather sour to 
                his<br>
                taste. The violet, a little too sentimental. The lime-blossoms, 
                too<br>
                small, and besides, there was such a large family of them. The<br>
                apple-blossoms, though they looked like roses, bloomed to-day, 
                but<br>
                might fall off to-morrow, with the first wind that blew; and he<br>
                thought that a marriage with one of them might last too short 
                a<br>
                time. The pea-blossom pleased him most of all; she was white and<br>
                red, graceful and slender, and belonged to those domestic maidens<br>
                who have a pretty appearance, and can yet be useful in the kitchen. 
                He was just about to make her an offer, when, close by the maiden, 
                he saw a pod, with a withered flower hanging at the end.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Who is that?&quot; he asked.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is my sister,&quot; replied the pea-blossom.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, indeed; and you will be like her some day,&quot; said 
                he; and he<br>
                flew away directly, for he felt quite shocked.<br>
              </p>
              <p>A honeysuckle hung forth from the hedge, in full bloom; but<br>
                there were so many girls like her, with long faces and sallow<br>
                complexions. No; he did not like her. But which one did he like?<br>
                Spring went by, and summer drew towards its close; autumn came;<br>
                but he had not decided. The flowers now appeared in their most<br>
                gorgeous robes, but all in vain; they had not the fresh, fragrant<br>
                air of youth. For the heart asks for fragrance, even when it is 
                no<br>
                longer young; and there is very little of that to be found in 
                the<br>
                dahlias or the dry chrysanthemums; therefore the butterfly turned 
                to<br>
                the mint on the ground. You know, this plant has no blossom; but 
                it is sweetness all over,- full of fragrance from head to foot, 
                with the<br>
                scent of a flower in every leaf.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I will take her,&quot; said the butterfly; and he made 
                her an offer.<br>
                But the mint stood silent and stiff, as she listened to him. At 
                last<br>
                she said,-<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Friendship, if you please; nothing more. I am old, and 
                you are<br>
                old, but we may live for each other just the same; as to marrying- 
                no;<br>
                don't let us appear ridiculous at our age.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And so it happened that the butterfly got no wife at all. He 
                had<br>
                been too long choosing, which is always a bad plan. And the<br>
                butterfly became what is called an old bachelor.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was late in the autumn, with rainy and cloudy weather. The 
                cold<br>
                wind blew over the bowed backs of the willows, so that they creaked<br>
                again. It was not the weather for flying about in summer clothes;<br>
                but fortunately the butterfly was not out in it. He had got a<br>
                shelter by chance. It was in a room heated by a stove, and as 
                warm<br>
                as summer. He could exist here, he said, well enough.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But it is not enough merely to exist,&quot; said he, &quot;I 
                need<br>
                freedom, sunshine, and a little flower for a companion.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then he flew against the window-pane, and was seen and admired<br>
                by those in the room, who caught him, and stuck him on a pin, 
                in a box of curiosities. They could not do more for him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now I am perched on a stalk, like the flowers,&quot; said 
                the<br>
                butterfly. &quot;It is not very pleasant, certainly; I should 
                imagine it is<br>
                something like being married; for here I am stuck fast.&quot; 
                And with this<br>
                thought he consoled himself a little.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That seems very poor consolation,&quot; said one of the 
                plants in<br>
                the room, that grew in a pot.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah,&quot; thought the butterfly, &quot;one can't very well 
                trust these<br>
                plants in pots; they have too much to do with mankind.&quot;</p>

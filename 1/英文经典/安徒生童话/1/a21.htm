              <p class="h" align="center"> TWO MAIDENS</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> HAVE you ever seen a maiden? I mean what our pavers call a maiden, 
                a thing with which they ram down the paving-stones in the roads. 
                A maiden of this kind is made altogether of wood, broad below, 
                and girt round with iron rings. At the top she is narrow, and 
                has a stick passed across through her waist, and this stick forms 
                the arms of the maiden.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the shed stood two Maidens of this kind. They had their place<br>
                among shovels, hand-carts, wheelbarrows, and measuring-tapes; 
                and to all this company the news had come that the Maidens were 
                no longer to be called &quot;maidens,&quot; but &quot;hand-rammers,&quot; 
                which word was the newest and the only correct designation among 
                the pavers for the thing we all know from the old times by the 
                name of &quot;the maiden.&quot;<br>
                Now, there are among us human creatures certain individuals who<br>
                are known as &quot;emancipated women,&quot; as, for instance, 
                principals of<br>
                institutions, dancers who stand professionally on one leg,<br>
                milliners, and sick-nurses; and with this class of emancipated 
                women<br>
                the two Maidens in the shed associated themselves. They were &quot;maidens&quot; 
                among the paver folk, and determined not to give up this honorable 
                appellation, and let themselves be miscalled &quot;rammers.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Maiden is a human name, but hand-rammer is a thing, and 
                we<br>
                won't be called things- that's insulting us.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;My lover would be ready to give up his engagement,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                youngest, who was betrothed to a paver's hammer; and the hammer 
                is the thing which drives great piles into the earth, like a machine, 
                and<br>
                therefore does on a large scale what ten maidens effect in a similar<br>
                way. &quot;He wants to marry me as a maiden, but whether he would 
                have me were I a hand-rammer is a question, so I won't have my 
                name changed.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And I,&quot; said the elder one, &quot;would rather have 
                both my arms<br>
                broken off.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the Wheelbarrow was of a different opinion; and the<br>
                Wheelbarrow was looked upon as of some consequence, for he<br>
                considered himself a quarter of a coach, because he went about 
                upon<br>
                one wheel.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I must submit to your notice,&quot; he said, &quot;that 
                the name 'maiden'<br>
                is common enough, and not nearly so refined as 'hand-rammer,' 
                or<br>
                'stamper,' which latter has also been proposed, and through which<br>
                you would be introduced into the category of seals; and only think<br>
                of the great stamp of state, which impresses the royal seal that 
                gives<br>
                effect to the laws! No, in your case I would surrender my maiden<br>
                name.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, certainly not!&quot; exclaimed the elder. &quot;I am 
                too old for that.&quot;<br>
                &quot;I presume you have never heard of what is called 'European<br>
                necessity?'&quot; observed the honest Measuring Tape. &quot;One 
                must be able<br>
                to adapt one's self to time and circumstances, and if there is 
                a law<br>
                that the 'maiden' is to be called 'hand-rammer,' why, she must 
                be<br>
                called 'hand-rammer,' and no pouting will avail, for everything 
                has<br>
                its measure.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No; if there must be a change,&quot; said the younger, 
                &quot;I should<br>
                prefer to be called 'Missy,' for that reminds one a little of<br>
                maidens.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But I would rather be chopped to chips,&quot; said the 
                elder.<br>
                At last they all went to work. The Maidens rode- that is, they<br>
                were put in a wheelbarrow, and that was a distinction; but still<br>
                they were called &quot;hand-rammers.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Mai-!&quot; they said, as they were bumped upon the pavement.<br>
                &quot;Mai-!&quot; and they were very nearly pronouncing the whole 
                word &quot;maiden;&quot;<br>
                but they broke off short, and swallowed the last syllable; for 
                after<br>
                mature deliberation they considered it beneath their dignity to<br>
                protest. But they always called each other &quot;maiden,&quot; 
                and praised the<br>
                good old days in which everything had been called by its right 
                name,<br>
                and those who were maidens were called maidens. And they remained 
                as they were; for the hammer really broke off his engagement with 
                the<br>
                younger one, for nothing would suit him but he must have a maiden<br>
                for his bride.</p>

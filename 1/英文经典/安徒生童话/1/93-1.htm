              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> HAVE you ever seen an old wooden cupboard quite black with age,<br>
                and ornamented with carved foliage and curious figures? Well, 
                just<br>
                such a cupboard stood in a parlor, and had been left to the family<br>
                as a legacy by the great-grandmother. It was covered from top 
                to<br>
                bottom with carved roses and tulips; the most curious scrolls 
                were<br>
                drawn upon it, and out of them peeped little stags' heads, with<br>
                antlers. In the middle of the cupboard door was the carved figure 
                of a<br>
                man most ridiculous to look at. He grinned at you, for no one 
                could<br>
                call it laughing. He had goat's legs, little horns on his head, 
                and<br>
                a long beard; the children in the room always called him, &quot;Major<br>
                general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat's-legs.&quot; It was<br>
                certainly a very difficult name to pronounce, and there are very 
                few<br>
                who ever receive such a title, but then it seemed wonderful how 
                he<br>
                came to be carved at all; yet there he was, always looking at 
                the<br>
                table under the looking-glass, where stood a very pretty little<br>
                shepherdess made of china. Her shoes were gilt, and her dress 
                had a<br>
                red rose or an ornament. She wore a hat, and carried a crook, 
                that<br>
                were both gilded, and looked very bright and pretty. Close by 
                her side stood a little chimney-sweep, as black as coal, and also 
                made of<br>
                china. He was, however, quite as clean and neat as any other china<br>
                figure; he only represented a black chimney-sweep, and the china<br>
                workers might just as well have made him a prince, had they felt<br>
                inclined to do so. He stood holding his ladder quite handily, 
                and<br>
                his face was as fair and rosy as a girl's; indeed, that was rather 
                a<br>
                mistake, it should have had some black marks on it. He and the<br>
                shepherdess had been placed close together, side by side; and, 
                being<br>
                so placed, they became engaged to each other, for they were very<br>
                well suited, being both made of the same sort of china, and being<br>
                equally fragile. Close to them stood another figure, three times 
                as<br>
                large as they were, and also made of china. He was an old Chinaman,<br>
                who could nod his head, and used to pretend that he was the<br>
                grandfather of the shepherdess, although he could not prove it. 
                He<br>
                however assumed authority over her, and therefore when<br>
                &quot;Major-general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat's-legs&quot; 
                asked for<br>
                the little shepherdess to be his wife, he nodded his head to show 
                that<br>
                he consented. &quot;You will have a husband,&quot; said the old 
                Chinaman to her, &quot;who I really believe is made of mahogany. 
                He will make you a lady of Major-general-field-sergeant-commander 
                Billy-goat's-legs. He has the whole cupboard full of silver plate, 
                which he keeps locked up in secret drawers.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I won't go into the dark cupboard,&quot; said the little 
                shepherdess. &quot;I have heard that he has eleven china wives 
                there already.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Then you shall be the twelfth,&quot; said the old Chinaman.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;To-night as soon as you hear a rattling in the old cupboard, 
                you<br>
                shall be married, as true as I am a Chinaman;&quot; and then he 
                nodded<br>
                his head and fell asleep.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the little shepherdess cried, and looked at her sweetheart,<br>
                the china chimney-sweep. &quot;I must entreat you,&quot; said 
                she, &quot;to go out<br>
                with me into the wide world, for we cannot stay here.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I will do whatever you wish,&quot; said the little chimney-sweep; 
                &quot;let<br>
                us go immediately: I think I shall be able to maintain you with 
                my<br>
                profession.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;If we were but safely down from the table!&quot; said she; 
                &quot;I shall<br>
                not be happy till we are really out in the world.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then he comforted her, and showed her how to place her little 
                foot<br>
                on the carved edge and gilt-leaf ornaments of the table. He brought<br>
                his little ladder to help her, and so they contrived to reach 
                the<br>
                floor. But when they looked at the old cupboard, they saw it was 
                all<br>
                in an uproar. The carved stags pushed out their heads, raised 
                their<br>
                antlers, and twisted their necks. The major-general sprung up 
                in the<br>
                air; and cried out to the old Chinaman, &quot;They are running 
                away! they<br>
                are running away!&quot; The two were rather frightened at this, 
                so they<br>
                jumped into the drawer of the window-seat. Here were three or 
                four<br>
                packs of cards not quite complete, and a doll's theatre, which 
                had<br>
                been built up very neatly. A comedy was being performed in it, 
                and all the queens of diamonds, clubs, and hearts,, and spades, 
                sat in the<br>
                first row fanning themselves with tulips, and behind them stood 
                all<br>
                the knaves, showing that they had heads above and below as playing<br>
                cards generally have. The play was about two lovers, who were 
                not<br>
                allowed to marry, and the shepherdess wept because it was so like<br>
                her own story. &quot;I cannot bear it,&quot; said she, &quot;I 
                must get out of the<br>
                drawer;&quot; but when they reached the floor, and cast their 
                eyes on the<br>
                table, there was the old Chinaman awake and shaking his whole 
                body,<br>
                till all at once down he came on the floor, &quot;plump.&quot; 
                &quot;The old Chinaman is coming,&quot; cried the little shepherdess 
                in a fright, and down she fell on one knee.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I have thought of something,&quot; said the chimney-sweep; 
                &quot;let us get<br>
                into the great pot-pourri jar which stands in the corner; there 
                we can<br>
                lie on rose-leaves and lavender, and throw salt in his eyes if 
                he<br>
                comes near us.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, that will never do,&quot; said she, &quot;because I 
                know that the<br>
                Chinaman and the pot-pourri jar were lovers once, and there always<br>
                remains behind a feeling of good-will between those who have been 
                so intimate as that. No, there is nothing left for us but to go 
                out<br>
                into the wide world.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Have you really courage enough to go out into the wide 
                world with<br>
                me?&quot; said the chimney-sweep; &quot;have you thought how large 
                it is, and<br>
                that we can never come back here again?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, I have,&quot; she replied.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When the chimney-sweep saw that she was quite firm, he said, 
                &quot;My<br>
                way is through the stove and up the chimney. Have you courage 
                to creep with me through the fire-box, and the iron pipe? When 
                we get to the chimney I shall know how to manage very well. We 
                shall soon climb too high for any one to reach us, and we shall 
                come through a hole in the top out into the wide world.&quot; 
                So he led her to the door of<br>
                the stove.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It looks very dark,&quot; said she; still she went in with 
                him through<br>
                the stove and through the pipe, where it was as dark as pitch.<br>
                &quot;Now we are in the chimney,&quot; said he; &quot;and look, 
                there is a<br>
                beautiful star shining above it.&quot; It was a real star shining 
                down upon<br>
                them as if it would show them the way. So they clambered, and 
                crept<br>
                on, and a frightful steep place it was; but the chimney-sweep 
                helped<br>
                her and supported her, till they got higher and higher. He showed<br>
                her the best places on which to set her little china foot, so 
                at<br>
                last they reached the top of the chimney, and sat themselves down, 
                for they were very tired, as may be supposed. The sky, with all 
                its stars, was over their heads, and below were the roofs of the 
                town. </p>
              <p>They could see for a very long distance out into the wide world, 
                and the poor little shepherdess leaned her head on her chimney-sweep's 
                shoulder, and wept till she washed the gilt off her sash; the 
                world was so different to what she expected. &quot;This is too 
                much,&quot; she said; &quot;I<br>
                cannot bear it, the world is too large. Oh, I wish I were safe 
                back on<br>
                the table. again, under the looking glass; I shall never be happy 
                till<br>
                I am safe back again. Now I have followed you out into the wide 
                world, you will take me back, if you love me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the chimney-sweep tried to reason with her, and spoke of<br>
                the old Chinaman, and of the Major-general-field-sergeant-commander 
                Billy-goat's legs; but she sobbed so bitterly, and kissed her 
                little chimney-sweep till he was obliged to do all she asked, 
                foolish as it was. And so, with a great deal of trouble, they 
                climbed down the chimney, and then crept through the pipe and 
                stove, which were certainly not very pleasant places. Then they 
                stood in the dark<br>
                fire-box, and listened behind the door, to hear what was going 
                on in<br>
                the room. As it was all quiet, they peeped out. Alas! there lay 
                the<br>
                old Chinaman on the floor; he had fallen down from the table as 
                he<br>
                attempted to run after them, and was broken into three pieces; 
                his<br>
                back had separated entirely, and his head had rolled into a corner<br>
                of the room. The major-general stood in his old place, and appeared<br>
                lost in thought.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This is terrible,&quot; said the little shepherdess. &quot;My 
                poor old<br>
                grandfather is broken to pieces, and it is our fault. I shall 
                never<br>
                live after this;&quot; and she wrung her little hands.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He can be riveted,&quot; said the chimney-sweep; &quot;he 
                can be riveted.<br>
                Do not be so hasty. If they cement his back, and put a good rivet 
                in<br>
                it, he will be as good as new, and be able to say as many disagreeable<br>
                things to us as ever.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Do you think so?&quot; said she; and then they climbed 
                up to the<br>
                table, and stood in their old places.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;As we have done no good,&quot; said the chimney-sweep, 
                &quot;we might as<br>
                well have remained here, instead of taking so much trouble.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I wish grandfather was riveted,&quot; said the shepherdess. 
                &quot;Will it<br>
                cost much, I wonder?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And she had her wish. The family had the Chinaman's back mended,<br>
                and a strong rivet put through his neck; he looked as good as 
                new, but he could no longer nod his head.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You have become proud since your fall broke you to pieces,&quot;<br>
                said Major-general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat's-legs. 
                &quot;You<br>
                have no reason to give yourself such airs. Am I to have her or 
                not?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The chimney-sweep and the little shepherdess looked piteously 
                at<br>
                the old Chinaman, for they were afraid he might nod; but he was 
                not<br>
                able: besides, it was so tiresome to be always telling strangers 
                he<br>
                had a rivet in the back of his neck.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And so the little china people remained together, and were glad 
                of<br>
                the grandfather's rivet, and continued to love each other till 
                they<br>
                were broken to pieces.</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> THE STORM SHAKES THE SHIELD</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IN the old days, when grandpapa was quite a little boy, and 
                ran<br>
                about in little red breeches and a red coat, and a feather in 
                his cap-<br>
                for that's the costume the little boys wore in his time when they 
                were<br>
                dressed in their best- many things were very different from what<br>
                they are now. There was often a good deal of show in the streets- 
                show that we don't see nowadays, because it has been abolished 
                as too old-fashioned. Still, it is very interesting to hear grandfather<br>
                tell about it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It must really have been a gorgeous sight to behold, in those<br>
                days, when the shoemaker brought over the shield, when the court-house 
                was changed. The silken flag waved to and fro, on the shield itself 
                a double eagle was displayed, and a big boot; the youngest lads<br>
                carried the &quot;welcome,&quot; and the chest of the workmen's 
                guild, and their shirt-sleeves were adorned with red and white 
                ribbons; the elder<br>
                ones carried drawn swords, each with a lemon stuck on its point. 
              </p>
              <p>There was a full band of music, and the most splendid of all 
                the instruments was the &quot;bird,&quot; as grandfather called 
                the big stick with the<br>
                crescent on the top, and all manner of dingle-dangles hanging 
                to it- a<br>
                perfect Turkish clatter of music. The stick was lifted high in 
                the<br>
                air, and swung up and down till it jingled again, and quite dazzled<br>
                one's eyes when the sun shone on all its glory of gold, and silver,<br>
                and brass.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In front of the procession ran the Harlequin, dressed in clothes<br>
                made of all kinds of colored patches artfully sewn together, with 
                a<br>
                black face, and bells on his head like a sledge horse. He beat 
                the<br>
                people with his bat, which made a great clattering without hurting<br>
                them, and the people would crowd together and fall back, only 
                to<br>
                advance again the next moment. Little boys and girls fell over 
                their<br>
                own toes into the gutter, old women dispensed digs with their<br>
                elbows, and looked sour, and took snuff. One laughed, another 
                chatted; the people thronged the windows and door-steps, and even 
                all the roofs. The sun shone; and although they had a little rain 
                too, that was good for the farmer; and when they got wetted thoroughly, 
                they only thought what a blessing it was for the country.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And what stories grandpapa could tell! As a little boy he had 
                seen<br>
                all these fine doings in their greatest pomp. The oldest of the<br>
                policemen used to make a speech from the platform on which the<br>
                shield was hung up, and the speech was in verse, as if it had 
                been<br>
                made by a poet, as, indeed it had; for three people had concocted 
                it<br>
                together, and they had first drunk a good bowl of punch, so that 
                the<br>
                speech might turn out well.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the people gave a cheer for the speech, but they shouted<br>
                much louder for the Harlequin, when he appeared in front of the<br>
                platform, and made a grimace at them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The fools played the fool most admirably, and drank mead out 
                of<br>
                spirit-glasses, which they then flung among the crowd, by whom 
                they<br>
                were caught up. Grandfather was the possessor of one of these 
                glasses, which had been given him by a working mason, who had 
                managed to catch it. Such a scene was really very pleasant; and 
                the shield on the new court-house was hung with flowers and green 
                wreaths.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;One never forgets a feast like that, however old one may 
                grow,&quot;<br>
                said grandfather. Nor did he forget it, though he saw many other 
                grand spectacles in his time, and could tell about them too; but 
                it was most pleasant of all to hear him tell about the shield 
                that was brought<br>
                in the town from the old to the new court-house.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Once, when he was a little boy, grandpapa had gone with his<br>
                parents to see this festivity. He had never yet been in the metropolis<br>
                of the country. There were so many people in the streets, that 
                he<br>
                thought that the shield was being carried. There were many shields<br>
                to be seen; a hundred rooms might have been filled with pictures, 
                if<br>
                they had been hung up inside and outside. At the tailor's were<br>
                pictures of all kinds of clothing, to show that he could stitch 
                up<br>
                people from the coarsest to the finest; at the tobacco<br>
                manufacturer's were pictures of the most charming little boys, 
                smoking cigars, just as they do in reality; there were signs with 
                painted butter, and herring, clerical collars, and coffins, and 
                inscriptions and announcements into the bargain. A person could 
                walk up and down for a whole day through the streets, and tire 
                himself out with looking at the pictures; and then he would know 
                all about what people lived in the houses, for they had hung out 
                their shields or signs; and, as grandfather said, it was a very 
                instructive thing, in a great town, to know at once who the inhabitants 
                were.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And this is what happened with these shields, when grandpapa<br>
                came to the town. He told it me himself, and he hadn't &quot;a 
                rogue on his<br>
                back,&quot; as mother used to tell me he had when he wanted to 
                make me<br>
                believe something outrageous, for now he looked quite trustworthy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The first night after he came to the town had been signalized 
                by<br>
                the most terrible gale ever recorded in the newspapers- a gale 
                such as<br>
                none of the inhabitants had ever before experienced. The air was<br>
                dark with flying tiles; old wood-work crashed and fell; and a<br>
                wheelbarrow ran up the streets all alone, only to get out of the<br>
                way. There was a groaning in the air, and a howling and a shrieking,<br>
                and altogether it was a terrible storm. The water in the canal 
                rose<br>
                over the banks, for it did not know where to run. The storm swept 
                over the town, carrying plenty of chimneys with it, and more than 
                one proud weathercock on a church tower had to bow, and has never 
                got over it from that time.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There was a kind of sentry-house, where dwelt the venerable old<br>
                superintendent of the fire brigade, who always arrived with the 
                last<br>
                engine. The storm would not leave this little sentry-house alone,<br>
                but must needs tear it from its fastenings, and roll it down the<br>
                street; and, wonderfully enough, it stopped opposite to the door 
                of<br>
                the dirty journeyman plasterer, who had saved three lives at the<br>
                last fire, but the sentry-house thought nothing of that.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The barber's shield, the great brazen dish, was carried away,<br>
                and hurled straight into the embrasure of the councillor of justice;<br>
                and the whole neighborhood said this looked almost like malice,<br>
                inasmuch as they, and nearly all the friends of the councillor's 
                wife,<br>
                used to call that lady &quot;the Razor&quot; for she was so sharp 
                that she<br>
                knew more about other people's business than they knew about it<br>
                themselves.<br>
              </p>
              <p>A shield with a dried salt fish painted on it flew exactly in<br>
                front of the door of a house where dwelt a man who wrote a<br>
                newspaper. That was a very poor joke perpetrated by the gale, 
                which<br>
                seemed to have forgotten that a man who writes in a paper is not 
                the<br>
                kind of person to understand any liberty taken with him; for he 
                is a<br>
                king in his own newspaper, and likewise in his own opinion.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The weathercock flew to the opposite house, where he perched,<br>
                looking the picture of malice- so the neighbors said.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The cooper's tub stuck itself up under the head of &quot;ladies'<br>
                costumes.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The eating-house keeper's bill of fare, which had hung at his 
                door<br>
                in a heavy frame, was posted by the storm over the entrance to 
                the<br>
                theatre, where nobody went. &quot;It was a ridiculous list- horse-radish,<br>
                soup, and stuffed cabbage.&quot; And now people came in plenty.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The fox's skin, the honorable sign of the furrier, was found<br>
                fastened to the bell-pull of a young man who always went to early<br>
                lecture, and looked like a furled umbrella. He said he was striving<br>
                after truth, and was considered by his aunt &quot;a model and 
                an example.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The inscription &quot;Institution for Superior Education&quot; 
                was found<br>
                near the billiard club, which place of resort was further adorned 
                with<br>
                the words, &quot;Children brought up by hand.&quot; Now, this 
                was not at all<br>
                witty; but, you see, the storm had done it, and no one has any 
                control<br>
                over that.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was a terrible night, and in the morning- only think!- nearly<br>
                all the shields had changed places. In some places the inscriptions<br>
                were so malicious, that grandfather would not speak of them at 
                all;<br>
                but I saw that he was chuckling secretly, and there may have been 
                some inaccuracy in his description, after all.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The poor people in the town, and still more the strangers, were<br>
                continually making mistakes in the people they wanted to see; 
                nor<br>
                was this to be avoided, when they went according to the shields 
                that<br>
                were hung up. Thus, for instance, some who wanted to go to a very<br>
                grave assembly of elderly men, where important affairs were to 
                be<br>
                discussed, found themselves in a noisy boys' school, where all 
                the<br>
                company were leaping over the chairs and tables.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There were also people who made a mistake between the church 
                and<br>
                the theatre, and that was terrible indeed!<br>
              </p>
              <p>Such a storm we have never witnessed in our day; for that only<br>
                happened in grandpapa's time, when he was quite a little boy.<br>
                Perhaps we shall never experience a storm of the kind, but our<br>
                grandchildren may; and we can only hope and pray that all may 
                stay<br>
                at home while the storm is moving the shields.</p>

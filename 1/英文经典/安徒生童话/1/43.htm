              <p class="h" align="center"> THE DAISY</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> Now listen! In the country, close by the high road, stood a<br>
                farmhouse; perhaps you have passed by and seen it yourself. There<br>
                was a little flower garden with painted wooden palings in front 
                of it;<br>
                close by was a ditch, on its fresh green bank grew a little daisy; 
                the<br>
                sun shone as warmly and brightly upon it as on the magnificent<br>
                garden flowers, and therefore it thrived well. One morning it 
                had<br>
                quite opened, and its little snow-white petals stood round the<br>
                yellow centre, like the rays of the sun. It did not mind that 
                nobody<br>
                saw it in the grass, and that it was a poor despised flower; on 
                the<br>
                contrary, it was quite happy, and turned towards the sun, looking<br>
                upward and listening to the song of the lark high up in the air.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The little daisy was as happy as if the day had been a great<br>
                holiday, but it was only Monday. All the children were at school,<br>
                and while they were sitting on the forms and learning their lessons,<br>
                it sat on its thin green stalk and learnt from the sun and from 
                its<br>
                surroundings how kind God is, and it rejoiced that the song of 
                the<br>
                little lark expressed so sweetly and distinctly its own feelings. 
                With<br>
                a sort of reverence the daisy looked up to the bird that could 
                fly and<br>
                sing, but it did not feel envious. &quot;I can see and hear,&quot; 
                it thought;<br>
                &quot;the sun shines upon me, and the forest kisses me. How rich 
                I am!&quot;<br>
                In the garden close by grew many large and magnificent flowers,<br>
                and, strange to say, the less fragrance they had the haughtier 
                and<br>
                prouder they were. The peonies puffed themselves up in order to 
                be<br>
                larger than the roses, but size is not everything! The tulips 
                had<br>
                the finest colours, and they knew it well, too, for they were 
                standing<br>
                bolt upright like candles, that one might see them the better. 
                In<br>
                their pride they did not see the little daisy, which looked over 
                to<br>
                them and thought, &quot;How rich and beautiful they are! I am 
                sure the<br>
                pretty bird will fly down and call upon them. Thank God, that 
                I<br>
                stand so near and can at least see all the splendour.&quot; And 
                while the<br>
                daisy was still thinking, the lark came flying down, crying &quot;Tweet,&quot;<br>
                but not to the peonies and tulips- no, into the grass to the poor<br>
                daisy. Its joy was so great that it did not know what to think. 
                The<br>
                little bird hopped round it and sang, &quot;How beautifully soft 
                the<br>
                grass is, and what a lovely little flower with its golden heart 
                and<br>
                silver dress is growing here.&quot; The yellow centre in the daisy 
                did<br>
                indeed look like gold, while the little petals shone as brightly 
                as<br>
                silver.<br>
              </p>
              <p>How happy the daisy was! No one has the least idea. The bird<br>
                kissed it with its beak, sang to it, and then rose again up to 
                the<br>
                blue sky. It was certainly more than a quarter of an hour before 
                the<br>
                daisy recovered its senses. Half ashamed, yet glad at heart, it 
                looked<br>
                over to the other flowers in the garden; surely they had witnessed 
                its<br>
                pleasure and the honour that had been done to it; they understood<br>
                its joy. But the tulips stood more stiffly than ever, their faces 
                were<br>
                pointed and red, because they were vexed. The peonies were sulky; 
                it<br>
                was well that they could not speak, otherwise they would have 
                given<br>
                the daisy a good lecture. The little flower could very well see 
                that<br>
                they were ill at ease, and pitied them sincerely.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Shortly after this a girl came into the garden, with a large 
                sharp<br>
                knife. She went to the tulips and began cutting them off, one 
                after<br>
                another. &quot;Ugh!&quot; sighed the daisy, &quot;that is terrible; 
                now they are done<br>
                for.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The girl carried the tulips away. The daisy was glad that it 
                was<br>
                outside, and only a small flower- it felt very grateful. At sunset<br>
                it folded its petals, and fell asleep, and dreamt all night of 
                the sun<br>
                and the little bird.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On the following morning, when the flower once more stretched<br>
                forth its tender petals, like little arms, towards the air and<br>
                light, the daisy recognised the bird's voice, but what it sang 
                sounded<br>
                so sad. Indeed the poor bird had good reason to be sad, for it 
                had<br>
                been caught and put into a cage close by the open window. It sang 
                of<br>
                the happy days when it could merrily fly about, of fresh green 
                corn in<br>
                the fields, and of the time when it could soar almost up to the<br>
                clouds. The poor lark was most unhappy as a prisoner in a cage. 
                The<br>
                little daisy would have liked so much to help it, but what could 
                be<br>
                done? Indeed, that was very difficult for such a small flower 
                to<br>
                find out. It entirely forgot how beautiful everything around it 
                was,<br>
                how warmly the sun was shining, and how splendidly white its own<br>
                petals were. It could only think of the poor captive bird, for 
                which<br>
                it could do nothing. Then two little boys came out of the garden;<br>
                one of them had a large sharp knife, like that with which the 
                girl had<br>
                cut the tulips. They came straight towards the little daisy, which<br>
                could not understand what they wanted.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Here is a fine piece of turf for the lark,&quot; said one 
                of the boys,<br>
                and began to cut out a square round the daisy, so that it remained<br>
                in the centre of the grass.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Pluck the flower off&quot; said the other boy, and the 
                daisy<br>
                trembled for fear, for to be pulled off meant death to it; and 
                it<br>
                wished so much to live, as it was to go with the square of turf 
                into<br>
                the poor captive lark's cage.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No let it stay,&quot; said the other boy, &quot;it looks 
                so pretty&quot;.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And so it stayed, and was brought into the lark's cage. The poor<br>
                bird was lamenting its lost liberty, and beating its wings against 
                the<br>
                wires; and the little daisy could not speak or utter a consoling 
                word,<br>
                much as it would have liked to do so. So the forenoon passed.<br>
                &quot;I have no water,&quot; said the captive lark, &quot;they 
                have all gone out,<br>
                and forgotten to give me anything to drink. My throat is dry and<br>
                burning. I feel as if I had fire and ice within me, and the air 
                is<br>
                so oppressive. Alas! I must die, and part with the warm sunshine,<br>
                the fresh green meadows, and all the beauty that God has created.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>And it thrust its beak into the piece of grass, to refresh itself 
                a<br>
                little. Then it noticed the little daisy, and nodded to it, and 
                kissed<br>
                it with its beak and said: &quot;You must also fade in here, poor 
                little<br>
                flower. You and the piece of grass are all they have given me 
                in<br>
                exchange for the whole world, which I enjoyed outside. Each little<br>
                blade of grass shall be a green tree for me, each of your white 
                petals<br>
                a fragrant flower. Alas! you only remind me of what I have lost.&quot;<br>
                &quot;I wish I could console the poor lark,&quot; thought the 
                daisy. It<br>
                could not move one of its leaves, but the fragrance of its delicate<br>
                petals streamed forth, and was much stronger than such flowers 
                usually have: the bird noticed it, although it was dying with 
                thirst, and in its pain tore up the green blades of grass, but 
                did not touch the<br>
                flower.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The evening came, and nobody appeared to bring the poor bird 
                a<br>
                drop of water; it opened its beautiful wings, and fluttered about 
                in<br>
                its anguish; a faint and mournful &quot;Tweet, tweet,&quot; was 
                all it could<br>
                utter, then it bent its little head towards the flower, and its<br>
                heart broke for want and longing. The flower could not, as on 
                the<br>
                previous evening, fold up its petals and sleep; it dropped<br>
                sorrowfully. The boys only came the next morning; when they saw 
                the dead bird, they began to cry bitterly, dug a nice grave for 
                it, and<br>
                adorned it with flowers. The bird's body was placed in a pretty 
                red<br>
                box; they wished to bury it with royal honours. While it was alive 
                and<br>
                sang they forgot it, and let it suffer want in the cage; now, 
                they<br>
                cried over it and covered it with flowers. The piece of turf, 
                with the<br>
                little daisy in it, was thrown out on the dusty highway. Nobody<br>
                thought of the flower which had felt so much for the bird and 
                had so<br>
                greatly desired to comfort it.</p>

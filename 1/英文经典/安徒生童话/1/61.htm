              <p class="h" align="center"> THE ICE MAIDEN</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> WE will pay a visit to Switzerland, and wander through that<br>
                country of mountains, whose steep and rocky sides are overgrown 
                with forest trees. Let us climb to the dazzling snow-fields at 
                their<br>
                summits, and descend again to the green meadows beneath, through 
                which rivers and brooks rush along as if they could not quickly 
                enough reach the sea and vanish. Fiercely shines the sun over 
                those deep valleys, as well as upon the heavy masses of snow which 
                lie on the mountains.<br>
              </p>
              <p>During the year these accumulations thaw or fall in the rolling<br>
                avalance, or are piled up in shining glaciers. Two of these glaciers<br>
                lie in the broad, rocky cliffs, between the Schreckhorn and the<br>
                Wetterhorn, near the little town of Grindelwald. They are wonderful 
                to<br>
                behold, and therefore in the summer time strangers come here from<br>
                all parts of the world to see them. They cross snow-covered mountains, 
                and travel through the deep valleys, or ascend for hours, higher 
                and still higher, the valleys appearing to sink lower and lower 
                as they proceed, and become as small as if seen from an air balloon. 
              </p>
              <p>Over the lofty summits of these mountains the clouds often hang 
                like a dark veil; while beneath in the valley, where many brown, 
                wooden houses are scattered about, the bright rays of the sun 
                may be shining upon a little brilliant patch of green, making 
                it appear almost<br>
                transparent. The waters foam and dash along in the valleys beneath;<br>
                the streams from above trickle and murmur as they fall down the<br>
                rocky mountain's side, looking like glittering silver bands.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On both sides of the mountain-path stand these little wooden<br>
                houses; and, as within, there are many children and many mouths 
                to<br>
                feed, each house has its own little potato garden. These children 
                rush<br>
                out in swarms, and surround travellers, whether on foot or in<br>
                carriages. They are all clever at making a bargain. They offer 
                for<br>
                sale the sweetest little toy-houses, models of the mountain cottages<br>
                in Switzerland. Whether it be rain or sunshine, these crowds of<br>
                children are always to be seen with their wares.<br>
              </p>
              <p>About twenty years ago, there might be seen occasionally, standing<br>
                at a short distance from the other children, a little boy, who 
                was<br>
                also anxious to sell his curious wares. He had an earnest,<br>
                expressive countenance, and held the box containing his carved 
                toys<br>
                tightly with both hands, as if unwilling to part with it. His<br>
                earnest look, and being also a very little boy, made him noticed 
                by<br>
                the strangers; so that he often sold the most, without knowing 
                why. </p>
              <p>An hour's walk farther up the ascent lived his grandfather, who 
                cut and carved the pretty little toy-houses; and in the old man's 
                room stood a large press, full of all sorts of carved things- 
                nut-crackers,<br>
                knives and forks, boxes with beautifully carved foliage, leaping<br>
                chamois. It contained everything that could delight the eyes of 
                a<br>
                child. But the boy, who was named Rudy, looked with still greater<br>
                pleasure and longing at some old fire-arms which hung upon the<br>
                rafters, under the ceiling of the room. His grandfather promised 
                him<br>
                that he should have them some day, but that he must first grow 
                big and strong, and learn how to use them. Small as he was, the 
                goats were placed in his care, and a good goat-keeper should also 
                be a good climber, and such Rudy was; he sometimes, indeed, climbed 
                higher than the goats, for he was fond of seeking for birds'-nests 
                at the top of high trees; he was bold and daring, but was seldom 
                seen to smile, excepting when he stood by the roaring cataract, 
                or heard the<br>
                descending roll of the avalanche. He never played with the other<br>
                children, and was not seen with them, unless his grandfather sent<br>
                him down to sell his curious workmanship. Rudy did not much like<br>
                trade; he loved to climb the mountains, or to sit by his grandfather<br>
                and listen to his tales of olden times, or of the people in Meyringen,<br>
                the place of his birth.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;In the early ages of the world,&quot; said the old man, 
                &quot;these people could not be found in Switzerland. They are 
                a colony from the<br>
                north, where their ancestors still dwell, and are called Swedes.&quot;<br>
                This was something for Rudy to know, but he learnt more from other<br>
                sources, particularly from the domestic animals who belonged to 
                the<br>
                house. One was a large dog, called Ajola, which had belonged to 
                his<br>
                father; and the other was a tom-cat. This cat stood very high 
                in<br>
                Rudy's favor, for he had taught him to climb.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Come out on the roof with me,&quot; said the cat; and Rudy 
                quite<br>
                understood him, for the language of fowls, ducks, cats, and dogs, 
                is<br>
                as easily understood by a young child as his own native tongue. 
                But it<br>
                must be at the age when grandfather's stick becomes a neighing<br>
                horse, with head, legs, and tail. Some children retain these ideas<br>
                later than others, and they are considered backwards and childish<br>
                for their age. People say so; but is it so?<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Come out on the roof with me, little Rudy,&quot; was the 
                first thing<br>
                he heard the cat say, and Rudy understood him. &quot;What people 
                say<br>
                about falling down is all nonsense,&quot; continued the cat; &quot;you 
                will<br>
                not fall, unless you are afraid. Come, now, set one foot here 
                and<br>
                another there, and feel your way with your fore-feet. Keep your 
                eyes<br>
                wide open, and move softly, and if you come to a hole jump over 
                it,<br>
                and cling fast as I do.&quot; And this was just what Rudy did. 
                He was often on the sloping roof with the cat, or on the tops 
                of high trees. But, more frequently, higher still on the ridges 
                of the rocks where puss never came.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Higher, higher!&quot; cried the trees and the bushes, &quot;see 
                to what<br>
                height we have grown, and how fast we hold, even to the narrow 
                edges of the rocks.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Rudy often reached the top of the mountain before the sunrise, 
                and<br>
                there inhaled his morning draught of the fresh, invigorating<br>
                mountain air,- God's own gift, which men call the sweet fragrance 
                of<br>
                plant and herb on the mountain-side, and the mint and wild thyme 
                in<br>
                the valleys. The overhanging clouds absorb all heaviness from 
                the air,<br>
                and the winds convey them away over the pine-tree summits. The<br>
                spirit of fragrance, light and fresh, remained behind, and this 
                was<br>
                Rudy's morning draught. The sunbeams- those blessing-bringing<br>
                daughters of the sun- kissed his cheeks. Vertigo might be lurking 
                on<br>
                the watch, but he dared not approach him. The swallows, who had 
                not less than seven nests in his grandfather's house, flew up 
                to him and his goats, singing, &quot;We and you, you and we.&quot; 
                They brought him<br>
                greetings from his grandfather's house, even from two hens, the 
                only<br>
                birds of the household; but Rudy was not intimate with them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Although so young and such a little fellow, Rudy had travelled 
                a<br>
                great deal. He was born in the canton of Valais, and brought to 
                his<br>
                grandfather over the mountains. He had walked to Staubbach- a 
                little<br>
                town that seems to flutter in the air like a silver veil- the<br>
                glittering, snow-clad mountain Jungfrau. He had also been to the 
                great<br>
                glaciers; but this is connected with a sad story, for here his<br>
                mother met her death, and his grandfather used to say that all<br>
                Rudy's childish merriment was lost from that time. His mother 
                had<br>
                written in a letter, that before he was a year old he had laughed 
                more<br>
                than he cried; but after his fall into the snow-covered crevasse,<br>
                his disposition had completely changed. The grandfather seldom 
                spoke of this, but the fact was generally known. Rudy's father 
                had been a postilion, and the large dog which now lived in his 
                grandfather's cottage had always followed him on his journeys 
                over the Simplon to the lake of Geneva. Rudy's relations, on his 
                father's side, lived in the canton of Valais, in the valley of 
                the Rhone. His uncle was a chamois hunter, and a well-known guide. 
                Rudy was only a year old when his father died, and his mother 
                was anxious to return with her child to her own relations, who 
                lived in the Bernese Oberland. Her father dwelt at a few hours' 
                distance from Grindelwald; he was a carver in wood, and gained 
                so much by it that he had plenty to live upon. She set out homewards 
                in the month of June, carrying her infant in her arms, and, accompanied 
                by two chamois hunters, crossed the Gemmi on her way to Grindelwald. 
                They had already left more than half the journey behind them. 
                They had crossed high ridges, and traversed snow-fields; they 
                could even see her native valley, with its familiar wooden cottages. 
                They had only one more glacier to climb.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Some newly fallen snow concealed a cleft which, though it did 
                not<br>
                extend to the foaming waters in the depths beneath, was still 
                much<br>
                deeper than the height of a man. The young woman, with the child 
                in<br>
                her arms, slipped upon it, sank in, and disappeared. Not a shriek, 
                not<br>
                a groan was heard; nothing but the whining of a little child. 
                More<br>
                than an hour elapsed before her two companions could obtain from 
                the nearest house ropes and poles to assist in raising them; and 
                it was<br>
                with much exertion that they at last succeeded in raising from 
                the<br>
                crevasse what appeared to be two dead bodies. Every means was 
                used to restore them to life. With the child they were successful, 
                but<br>
                not with the mother; so the old grandfather received his daughter's<br>
                little son into his house an orphan,- a little boy who laughed 
                more<br>
                than he cried; but it seemed as if laughter had left him in the 
                cold<br>
                ice-world into which he had fallen, where, as the Swiss peasants<br>
                say, the souls of the lost are confined till the judgment-day.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The glaciers appear as if a rushing stream had been frozen in<br>
                its course, and pressed into blocks of green crystal, which,<br>
                balanced one upon another, form a wondrous palace of crystal for 
                the Ice Maiden- the queen of the glaciers. It is she whose mighty 
                power can crush the traveller to death, and arrest the flowing 
                river in<br>
                its course. She is also a child of the air, and with the swiftness<br>
                of the chamois she can reach the snow-covered mountain tops, where 
                the boldest mountaineer has to cut footsteps in the ice to ascend. 
                She<br>
                will sail on a frail pine-twig over the raging torrents beneath, 
                and<br>
                spring lightly from one iceberg to another, with her long,<br>
                snow-white hair flowing around her, and her dark-green robe glittering<br>
                like the waters of the deep Swiss lakes. &quot;Mine is the power 
                to seize<br>
                and crush,&quot; she cried. &quot;Once a beautiful boy was stolen 
                from me by<br>
                man,- a boy whom I had kissed, but had not kissed to death. He 
                is<br>
                again among mankind, and tends the goats on the mountains. He 
                is<br>
                always climbing higher and higher, far away from all others, but 
                not<br>
                from me. He is mine; I will send for him.&quot; And she gave Vertigo 
                the<br>
                commission.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was summer, and the Ice Maiden was melting amidst the green<br>
                verdure, when Vertigo swung himself up and down. Vertigo has many<br>
                brothers, quite a troop of them, and the Ice Maiden chose the<br>
                strongest among them. They exercise their power in different ways, 
                and everywhere. Some sit on the banisters of steep stairs, others 
                on the outer rails of lofty towers, or spring like squirrels along 
                the ridges<br>
                of the mountains. Others tread the air as a swimmer treads the<br>
                water, and lure their victims here and there till they fall into 
                the<br>
                deep abyss. Vertigo and the Ice Maiden clutch at human beings, 
                as<br>
                the polypus seizes upon all that comes within its reach. And now<br>
                Vertigo was to seize Rudy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Seize him, indeed,&quot; cried Vertigo; &quot;I cannot 
                do it. That<br>
                monster of a cat has taught him her tricks. That child of the 
                human<br>
                race has a power within him which keeps me at a distance; I cannot<br>
                possibly reach the boy when he hangs from the branches of trees,<br>
                over the precipice; or I would gladly tickle his feet, and send 
                him<br>
                heels over head through the air; but I cannot accomplish it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We must accomplish it,&quot; said the Ice Maiden; &quot;either 
                you or I<br>
                must; and I will- I will!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, no!&quot; sounded through the air, like an echo on 
                the mountain<br>
                church bells chime. It was an answer in song, in the melting tones<br>
                of a chorus from others of nature's spirits- good and loving<br>
                spirits, the daughters of the sunbeam. They who place themselves 
                in<br>
                a circle every evening on the mountain peaks; there they spread 
                out<br>
                their rose-colored wings, which, as the sun sinks, become more 
                flaming red, until the lofty Alps seem to burn with fire. Men 
                call this the Alpine glow. After the sun has set, they disappear 
                within the white<br>
                snow on the mountain-tops, and slumber there till sunrise, when 
                they<br>
                again come forth. They have great love for flowers, for butterflies,<br>
                and for mankind; and from among the latter they had chosen little<br>
                Rudy. &quot;You shall not catch him; you shall not seize him!&quot; 
                they sang.<br>
                &quot;Greater and stronger than he have I seized!&quot; said the 
                Ice Maiden.<br>
                Then the daughters of the sun sang a song of the traveller,<br>
                whose cloak had been carried away by the wind. &quot;The wind 
                took the<br>
                covering, but not the man; it could even seize upon him, but not<br>
                hold him fast. The children of strength are more powerful, more<br>
                ethereal, even than we are. They can rise higher than our parent,<br>
                the sun. They have the magic words that rule the wind and the 
                waves,<br>
                and compel them to serve and obey; and they can, at last, cast 
                off the<br>
                heavy, oppressive weight of mortality, and soar upwards.&quot; 
                Thus sweetly sounded the bell-like tones of the chorus.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And each morning the sun's rays shone through the one little<br>
                window of the grandfather's house upon the quiet child. The<br>
                daughters of the sunbeam kissed him; they wished to thaw, and 
                melt,<br>
                and obliterate the ice kiss which the queenly maiden of the glaciers<br>
                had given him as he lay in the lap of his dead mother, in the 
                deep<br>
                crevasse of ice from which he had been so wonderfully rescued.<br>
              </p>
              <p>II. THE JOURNEY TO THE NEW HOME</p>
              <p> Rudy was just eight years old, when his uncle, who lived on 
                the<br>
                other side of the mountain, wished to have the boy, as he thought 
                he<br>
                might obtain a better education with him, and learn something 
                more.<br>
                His grandfather thought the same, so he consented to let him go.<br>
                Rudy had many to say farewell to, as well as his grandfather. 
                First,<br>
                there was Ajola, the old dog.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Your father was the postilion, and I was the postilion's 
                dog,&quot;<br>
                said Ajola. &quot;We have often travelled the same journey together; 
                I knew all the dogs and men on this side of the mountain. It is 
                not my<br>
                habit to talk much; but now that we have so little time to converse<br>
                together, I will say something more than usual. I will relate 
                to you a<br>
                story, which I have reflected upon for a long time. I do not<br>
                understand it, and very likely you will not, but that is of no<br>
                consequence. I have, however, learnt from it that in this world 
                things<br>
                are not equally divided, neither for dogs nor for men. All are 
                not<br>
                born to lie on the lap and to drink milk: I have never been petted<br>
                in this way, but I have seen a little dog seated in the place 
                of a<br>
                gentleman or lady, and travelling inside a post-chaise. The lady,<br>
                who was his mistress, or of whom he was master, carried a bottle 
                of<br>
                milk, of which the little dog now and then drank; she also offered 
                him<br>
                pieces of sugar to crunch. He sniffed at them proudly, but would 
                not<br>
                eat one, so she ate them herself. I was running along the dirty 
                road<br>
                by the side of the carriage as hungry as a dog could be, chewing 
                the<br>
                cud of my own thoughts, which were rather in confusion. But many 
                other things seemed in confusion also. Why was not I lying on 
                a lap and travelling in a coach? I could not tell; yet I knew 
                I could not<br>
                alter my own condition, either by barking or growling.<br>
              </p>
              <p>This was Ajola's farewell speech, and Rudy threw his arms round<br>
                the dog's neck and kissed his cold nose. Then he took the cat 
                in his<br>
                arms, but he struggled to get free.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are getting too strong for me,&quot; he said; &quot;but 
                I will not<br>
                use my claws against you. Clamber away over the mountains; it 
                was I<br>
                who taught you to climb. Do not fancy you are going to fall, and 
                you<br>
                will be quite safe.&quot; Then the cat jumped down and ran away; 
                he did not wish Rudy to see that there were tears in his eyes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The hens were hopping about the floor; one of them had no tail;<br>
                a traveller, who fancied himself a sportsman, had shot off her 
                tail,<br>
                he had mistaken her for a bird of prey.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Rudy is going away over the mountains,&quot; said one of 
                the hens.<br>
                &quot;He is always in such a hurry,&quot; said the other; &quot;and 
                I don't<br>
                like taking leave,&quot; so they both hopped out.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the goats said farewell; they bleated and wanted to go with<br>
                him, they were so very sorry.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Just at this time two clever guides were going to cross the<br>
                mountains to the other side of the Gemmi, and Rudy was to go with 
                them on foot. It was a long walk for such a little boy, but he 
                had plenty of strength and invincible courage. The swallows flew 
                with him a little way, singing, &quot;We and you- you and we.&quot; 
                The way led across<br>
                the rushing Lutschine, which falls in numerous streams from the 
                dark<br>
                clefts of the Grindelwald glaciers. Trunks of fallen trees and<br>
                blocks of stone form bridges over these streams. After passing 
                a<br>
                forest of alders, they began to ascend, passing by some blocks 
                of<br>
                ice that had loosened themselves from the side of the mountain 
                and lay across their path; they had to step over these ice-blocks 
                or walk<br>
                round them. Rudy crept here and ran there, his eyes sparkling 
                with<br>
                joy, and he stepped so firmly with his iron-tipped mountain shoe, 
                that<br>
                he left a mark behind him wherever he placed his foot.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The earth was black where the mountain torrents or the melted<br>
                ice had poured upon it, but the bluish green, glassy ice sparkled<br>
                and glittered. They had to go round little pools, like lakes, 
                enclosed<br>
                between large masses of ice; and, while thus wandering out of 
                their<br>
                path, they came near an immense stone, which lay balanced on the<br>
                edge of an icy peak. The stone lost its balance just as they reached<br>
                it, and rolled over into the abyss beneath, while the noise of 
                its<br>
                fall was echoed back from every hollow cliff of the glaciers.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They were always going upwards. The glaciers seemed to spread<br>
                above them like a continued chain of masses of ice, piled up in 
                wild<br>
                confusion between bare and rugged rocks. Rudy thought for a moment 
                of what had been told him, that he and his mother had once lain 
                buried in one of these cold, heart-chilling fissures; but he soon 
                banished such thoughts, and looked upon the story as fabulous, 
                like many other stories which had been told him. Once or twice, 
                when the men thought the way was rather difficult for such a little 
                boy, they<br>
                held out their hands to assist him; but he would not accept their<br>
                assistance, for he stood on the slippery ice as firmly as if he 
                had<br>
                been a chamois. They came at length to rocky ground; sometimes<br>
                stepping upon moss-covered stones, sometimes passing beneath stunted 
                fir-trees, and again through green meadows. The landscape was 
                always changing, but ever above them towered the lofty snow-clad 
                mountains, whose names not only Rudy but every other child knew- 
                &quot;The Jungfrau,&quot; &quot;The Monk and the Eiger.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Rudy had never been so far away before; he had never trodden 
                on<br>
                the wide-spreading ocean of snow that lay here with its immovable<br>
                billows, from which the wind blows off the snowflake now and then,<br>
                as it cuts the foam from the waves of the sea. The glaciers stand 
                here<br>
                so close together it might almost be said they are hand-in-hand; 
                and<br>
                each is a crystal palace for the Ice Maiden, whose power and will 
                it<br>
                is to seize and imprison the unwary traveller.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The sun shone warmly, and the snow sparkled as if covered with<br>
                glittering diamonds. Numerous insects, especially butterflies 
                and<br>
                bees, lay dead in heaps on the snow. They had ventured too high, 
                or<br>
                the wind had carried them here and left them to die of cold.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Around the Wetterhorn hung a feathery cloud, like a woolbag, 
                and a<br>
                threatening cloud too, for as it sunk lower it increased in size,<br>
                and concealed within was a &quot;fohn,&quot; fearful in its violence 
                should it<br>
                break loose. This journey, with its varied incidents,- the wild 
                paths,<br>
                the night passed on the mountain, the steep rocky precipices, 
                the<br>
                hollow clefts, in which the rustling waters from time immemorial 
                had<br>
                worn away passages for themselves through blocks of stone,- all<br>
                these were firmly impressed on Rudy's memory.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In a forsaken stone building, which stood just beyond the seas<br>
                of snow, they one night took shelter. Here they found some charcoal<br>
                and pine branches, so that they soon made a fire. They arranged<br>
                couches to lie on as well as they could, and then the men seated<br>
                themselves by the fire, took out their pipes, and began to smoke. 
              </p>
              <p>They also prepared a warm, spiced drink, of which they partook 
                and Rudy was not forgotten- he had his share. Then they began 
                to talk of those mysterious beings with which the land of the 
                Alps abounds; the hosts of apparitions which come in the night, 
                and carry off the sleepers through the air, to the wonderful floating 
                town of Venice; of the wild herds-man, who drives the black sheep 
                across the meadows. </p>
              <p>These flocks are never seen, yet the tinkle of their little bells 
                has often been heard, as well as their unearthly bleating. Rudy 
                listened eagerly, but without fear, for he knew not what fear 
                meant; and while he<br>
                listened, he fancied he could hear the roaring of the spectral 
                herd.<br>
                It seemed to come nearer and roar louder, till the men heard it 
                also<br>
                and listened in silence, till, at length, they told Rudy that 
                he<br>
                must not dare to sleep. It was a &quot;fohn,&quot; that violent 
                storm-wind which<br>
                rushes from the mountain to the valley beneath, and in its fury<br>
                snaps asunder the trunks of large trees as if they were but slender<br>
                reeds, and carries the wooden houses from one side of a river 
                to the<br>
                other as easily as we could move the pieces on a chess-board. 
                After an hour had passed, they told Rudy that it was all over, 
                and he might<br>
                go to sleep; and, fatigued with his long walk, he readily slept 
                at the<br>
                word of command.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Very early the following morning they again set out. The sun 
                on<br>
                this day lighted up for Rudy new mountains, new glaciers, and 
                new<br>
                snow-fields. They had entered the Canton Valais, and found<br>
                themselves on the ridge of the hills which can be seen from<br>
                Grindelwald; but he was still far from his new home. They pointed<br>
                out to him other clefts, other meadows, other woods and rocky 
                paths, and other houses. Strange men made their appearance before 
                him, and what men! They were misshapen, wretched-looking creatures, 
                with yellow complexions; and on their necks were dark, ugly lumps 
                of flesh, hanging down like bags. They were called cretins. They 
                dragged themselves along painfully, and stared at the strangers 
                with vacant eyes. The women looked more dreadful than the men. 
                Poor Rudy! were these the sort of people he should see at his 
                new home?<br>
              </p>
              <p>III. THE UNCLE</p>
              <p> Rudy arrived at last at his uncle's house, and was thankful 
                to<br>
                find the people like those he had been accustomed to see. There 
                was<br>
                only one cretin amongst them, a poor idiot boy, one of those<br>
                unfortunate beings who, in their neglected conditions, go from 
                house<br>
                to house, and are received and taken care of in different families,<br>
                for a month or two at a time.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Poor Saperli had just arrived at his uncle's house when Rudy 
                came.<br>
                The uncle was an experienced hunter; he also followed the trade 
                of a<br>
                cooper; his wife was a lively little person, with a face like 
                a<br>
                bird, eyes like those of an eagle, and a long, hairy throat.<br>
                Everything was new to Rudy- the fashion of the dress, the manners, 
                the employments, and even the language; but the latter his childish 
                ear<br>
                would soon learn. He saw also that there was more wealth here, 
                when<br>
                compared with his former home at his grandfather's. The rooms 
                were<br>
                larger, the walls were adorned with the horns of the chamois, 
                and<br>
                brightly polished guns. Over the door hung a painting of the Virgin<br>
                Mary, fresh alpine roses and a burning lamp stood near it. Rudy's<br>
                uncle was, as we have said, one of the most noted chamois hunters 
                in<br>
                the whole district, and also one of the best guides. Rudy soon<br>
                became the pet of the house; but there was another pet, an old<br>
                hound, blind and lazy, who would never more follow the hunt, well 
                as<br>
                he had once done so. But his former good qualities were not forgotten, 
                and therefore the animal was kept in the family and treated with 
                every indulgence. Rudy stroked the old hound, but he did not like 
                strangers, and Rudy was as yet a stranger; he did not, however, 
                long remain so, he soon endeared himself to every heart, and became 
                like one of the family.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We are not very badly off, here in the canton Valais,&quot; 
                said his<br>
                uncle one day; &quot;we have the chamois, they do not die so fast 
                as the<br>
                wild goats, and it is certainly much better here now than in former<br>
                times. How highly the old times have been spoken of, but ours 
                is<br>
                better. The bag has been opened, and a current of air now blows<br>
                through our once confined valley. Something better always makes 
                its<br>
                appearance when old, worn-out things fail.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>When his uncle became communicative, he would relate stories 
                of<br>
                his youthful days, and farther back still of the warlike times 
                in<br>
                which his father had lived. Valais was then, as he expressed it,<br>
                only a closed-up bag, quite full of sick people, miserable cretins;<br>
                but the French soldiers came, and they were capital doctors, they 
                soon killed the disease and the sick people, too. The French people 
                knew how to fight in more ways than one, and the girls knew how 
                to<br>
                conquer too; and when he said this the uncle nodded at his wife, 
                who<br>
                was a French woman by birth, and laughed. The French could also 
                do battle on the stones. &quot;It was they who cut a road out 
                of the solid<br>
                rock over the Simplon- such a road, that I need only say to a 
                child of<br>
                three years old, 'Go down to Italy, you have only to keep in the<br>
                high road,' and the child will soon arrive in Italy, if he followed 
                my<br>
                directions.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the uncle sang a French song, and cried, &quot;Hurrah! long 
                live<br>
                Napoleon Buonaparte.&quot; This was the first time Rudy had ever 
                heard of France, or of Lyons, that great city on the Rhone where 
                his uncle<br>
                had once lived. His uncle said that Rudy, in a very few years, 
                would<br>
                become a clever hunter, he had quite a talent for it; he taught 
                the<br>
                boy to hold a gun properly, and to load and fire it. In the hunting<br>
                season he took him to the hills, and made him drink the warm blood<br>
                of the chamois, which is said to prevent the hunter from becoming<br>
                giddy; he taught him to know the time when, from the different<br>
                mountains, the avalanche is likely to fall, namely, at noontide 
                or<br>
                in the evening, from the effects of the sun's rays; he made him<br>
                observe the movements of the chamois when he gave a leap, so that 
                he might fall firmly and lightly on his feet. He told him that 
                when on<br>
                the fissures of the rocks he could find no place for his feet, 
                he must<br>
                support himself on his elbows, and cling with his legs, and even<br>
                lean firmly with his back, for this could be done when necessary. 
                He<br>
                told him also that the chamois are very cunning, they place<br>
                lookers-out on the watch; but the hunter must be more cunning 
                than<br>
                they are, and find them out by the scent.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One day, when Rudy went out hunting with his uncle, he hung a 
                coat<br>
                and hat on an alpine staff, and the chamois mistook it for a man, 
                as<br>
                they generally do. The mountain path was narrow here; indeed it 
                was<br>
                scarcely a path at all, only a kind of shelf, close to the yawning<br>
                abyss. The snow that lay upon it was partially thawed, and the<br>
                stones crumbled beneath the feet. Every fragment of stone broken 
                off<br>
                struck the sides of the rock in its fall, till it rolled into 
                the<br>
                depths beneath, and sunk to rest. Upon this shelf Rudy's uncle 
                laid<br>
                himself down, and crept forward. At about a hundred paces behind 
                him stood Rudy, upon the highest point of the rock, watching a 
                great<br>
                vulture hovering in the air; with a single stroke of his wing 
                the bird<br>
                might easily cast the creeping hunter into the abyss beneath, 
                and make<br>
                him his prey. Rudy's uncle had eyes for nothing but the chamois,<br>
                who, with its young kid, had just appeared round the edge of the 
                rock.<br>
              </p>
              <p>So Rudy kept his eyes fixed on the bird, he knew well what the 
                great<br>
                creature wanted; therefore he stood in readiness to discharge 
                his<br>
                gun at the proper moment. Suddenly the chamois made a spring, 
                and<br>
                his uncle fired and struck the animal with the deadly bullet; 
                while<br>
                the young kid rushed away, as if for a long life he had been<br>
                accustomed to danger and practised flight. The large bird, alarmed<br>
                at the report of the gun, wheeled off in another direction, and 
                Rudy's<br>
                uncle was saved from danger, of which he knew nothing till he 
                was told of it by the boy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>While they were both in pleasant mood, wending their way<br>
                homewards, and the uncle whistling the tune of a song he had learnt 
                in<br>
                his young days, they suddenly heard a peculiar sound which seemed 
                to come from the top of the mountain. They looked up, and saw 
                above them, on the over-hanging rock, the snow-covering heave 
                and lift itself as a piece of linen stretched on the ground to 
                dry raises itself when the wind creeps under it. Smooth as polished 
                marble slabs, the waves of snow cracked and loosened themselves, 
                and then suddenly, with the rumbling noise of distant thunder, 
                fell like a foaming cataract into the abyss. An avalanche had 
                fallen, not upon Rudy and his uncle, but very near them. Alas, 
                a great deal too near!<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Hold fast, Rudy!&quot; cried his uncle; &quot;hold fast, 
                with all your<br>
                might.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then Rudy clung with his arms to the trunk of the nearest tree,<br>
                while his uncle climbed above him, and held fast by the branches.<br>
                The avalanche rolled past them at some distance; but the gust 
                of<br>
                wind that followed, like the storm-wings of the avalanche, snapped<br>
                asunder the trees and bushes over which it swept, as if they had<br>
                been but dry rushes, and threw them about in every direction. 
                The tree to which Rudy clung was thus overthrown, and Rudy dashed 
                to the ground. The higher branches were snapped off, and carried 
                away to a great distance; and among these shattered branches lay 
                Rudy's uncle, with his skull fractured. When they found him, his 
                hand was still warm; but it would have been impossible to recognize 
                his face. </p>
              <p>Rudy stood by, pale and trembling; it was the first shock of 
                his life,<br>
                the first time he had ever felt fear. Late in the evening he<br>
                returned home with the fatal news,- to that home which was now 
                to be so full of sorrow. His uncle's wife uttered not a word, 
                nor shed a<br>
                tear, till the corpse was brought in; then her agony burst forth.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The poor cretin crept away to his bed, and nothing was seen of 
                him<br>
                during the whole of the following day. Towards evening, however, 
                he<br>
                came to Rudy, and said, &quot;Will you write a letter for me? 
                Saperli<br>
                cannot write; Saperli can only take the letters to the post.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;A letter for you!&quot; said Rudy; &quot;who do you wish 
                to write to?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;To the Lord Christ,&quot; he replied.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Rudy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the poor idiot, as the cretin was often called, looked at<br>
                Rudy with a most touching expression in his eyes, clasped his 
                hands,<br>
                and said, solemnly and devoutly, &quot;Saperli wants to send a 
                letter to<br>
                Jesus Christ, to pray Him to let Saperli die, and not the master 
                of<br>
                the house here.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Rudy pressed his hand, and replied, &quot;A letter would not 
                reach<br>
                Him up above; it would not give him back whom we have lost.&quot;<br>
                It was not, however, easy for Rudy to convince Saperli of the<br>
                impossibility of doing what he wished.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now you must work for us,&quot; said his foster-mother; 
                and Rudy<br>
                very soon became the entire support of the house.<br>
              </p>
              <p>BABETTE<br>
                IV. BABETTE</p>
              <p> Who was the best marksman in the canton Valais? The chamois 
                knew<br>
                well. &quot;Save yourselves from Rudy,&quot; they might well say. 
                And who is the handsomest marksman? &quot;Oh, it is Rudy,&quot; 
                said the maidens; but they did not say, &quot;Save yourselves 
                from Rudy.&quot; Neither did anxious<br>
                mothers say so; for he bowed to them as pleasantly as to the young<br>
                girls. He was so brave and cheerful. His cheeks were brown, his<br>
                teeth white, and his eyes dark and sparkling. He was now a handsome<br>
                young man of twenty years. The most icy water could not deter 
                him from swimming; he could twist and turn like a fish. None could 
                climb like he, and he clung as firmly to the edges of the rocks 
                as a limpet. He had strong muscular power, as could be seen when 
                he leapt from rock to rock. He had learnt this first from the 
                cat, and more lately from the chamois. Rudy was considered the 
                best guide over the mountains; every one had great confidence 
                in him. He might have made a great deal of money as guide. His 
                uncle had also taught him the trade of a cooper; but he had no 
                inclination for either; his delight was in chamois-hunting, which 
                also brought him plenty of money. </p>
              <p>Rudy would be a very good match, as people said, if he would 
                not look above his own station. He was also such a famous partner 
                in dancing, that the girls often dreamt about him, and one and 
                another thought of him even when awake.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He kissed me in the dance,&quot; said Annette, the schoolmaster's<br>
                daughter, to her dearest friend; but she ought not to have told<br>
                this, even to her dearest friend. It is not easy to keep such 
                secrets;<br>
                they are like sand in a sieve; they slip out. It was therefore 
                soon<br>
                known that Rudy, so brave and so good as he was, had kissed some 
                one while dancing, and yet he had never kissed her who was dearest 
                to him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah, ah,&quot; said an old hunter, &quot;he has kissed Annette, 
                has he? he<br>
                has begun with A, and I suppose he will kiss through the whole<br>
                alphabet.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But a kiss in the dance was all the busy tongues could accuse<br>
                him of. He certainly had kissed Annette, but she was not the flower 
                of<br>
                his heart.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Down in the valley, near Bex, among the great walnut-trees, by 
                the<br>
                side of a little rushing mountain-stream, lived a rich miller. 
                His<br>
                dwelling-house was a large building, three storeys high, with 
                little<br>
                turrets. The roof was covered with chips, bound together with 
                tin<br>
                plates, that glittered in sunshine and in the moonlight. The largest<br>
                of the turrets had a weather-cock, representing an apple pierced 
                by<br>
                a glittering arrow, in memory of William Tell. The mill was a 
                neat and<br>
                well-ordered place, that allowed itself to be sketched and written<br>
                about; but the miller's daughter did not permit any to sketch 
                or write<br>
                about her. So, at least, Rudy would have said, for her image was<br>
                pictured in his heart; her eyes shone in it so brightly, that 
                quite<br>
                a flame had been kindled there; and, like all other fires, it 
                had<br>
                burst forth so suddenly, that the miller's daughter, the beautiful<br>
                Babette, was quite unaware of it. Rudy had never spoken a word 
                to<br>
                her on the subject. The miller was rich, and, on that account, 
                Babette<br>
                stood very high, and was rather difficult to aspire to. But said<br>
                Rudy to himself, &quot;Nothing is too high for a man to reach: 
                he must<br>
                climb with confidence in himself, and he will not fail.&quot; 
                He had learnt<br>
                this lesson in his youthful home.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It happened once that Rudy had some business to settle at Bex.<br>
                It was a long journey at that time, for the railway had not been<br>
                opened. From the glaciers of the Rhone, at the foot of the Simplon,<br>
                between its ever-changing mountain summits, stretches the valley 
                of<br>
                the canton Valais. Through it runs the noble river of the Rhone, 
                which<br>
                often overflows its banks, covering fields and highways, and<br>
                destroying everything in its course. Near the towns of Sion and 
                St.<br>
                Maurice, the valley takes a turn, and bends like an elbow, and<br>
                behind St. Maurice becomes so narrow that there is only space 
                enough for the bed of the river and a narrow carriage-road. An 
                old tower stands here, as if it were guardian to the canton Valais, 
                which ends at this point; and from it we can look across the stone 
                bridge to<br>
                the toll-house on the other side, where the canton Vaud commences. 
                Not far from this spot stands the town of Bex, and at every step 
                can be seen an increase of fruitfulness and verdure. It is like 
                entering a<br>
                grove of chestnut and walnut-trees. Here and there the cypress 
                and<br>
                pomegranate blossoms peep forth; and it is almost as warm as an<br>
                Italian climate. Rudy arrived at Bex, and soon finished the business<br>
                which had brought him there, and then walked about the town; but 
                not even the miller's boy could be seen, nor any one belonging 
                to the<br>
                mill, not to mention Babette. This did not please him at all.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Evening came on. The air was filled with the perfume of the wild 
                thyme and the blossoms of the lime-trees, and the green woods 
                on the mountains seemed to be covered with a shining veil, blue 
                as the sky.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Over everything reigned a stillness, not of sleep or of death, 
                but<br>
                as if Nature were holding her breath, that her image might be<br>
                photographed on the blue vault of heaven. Here and there, amidst 
                the<br>
                trees of the silent valley, stood poles which supported the wires 
                of<br>
                the electric telegraph. Against one of these poles leaned an object 
                so<br>
                motionless that it might have been mistaken for the trunk of a 
                tree;<br>
                but it was Rudy, standing there as still as at that moment was<br>
                everything around him. He was not asleep, neither was he dead; 
                but<br>
                just as the various events in the world- matters of momentous<br>
                importance to individuals- were flying through the telegraph wires,<br>
                without the quiver of a wire or the slightest tone, so, through 
                the<br>
                mind of Rudy, thoughts of overwhelming importance were passing,<br>
                without an outward sign of emotion. The happiness of his future 
                life<br>
                depended upon the decision of his present reflections. His eyes 
                were<br>
                fixed on one spot in the distance- a light that twinkled through 
                the<br>
                foliage from the parlor of the miller's house, where Babette dwelt.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Rudy stood so still, that it might have been supposed he was<br>
                watching for a chamois; but he was in reality like a chamois, 
                who will<br>
                stand for a moment, looking as if it were chiselled out of the 
                rock,<br>
                and then, if only a stone rolled by, would suddenly bound forward 
                with a spring, far away from the hunter. And so with Rudy: a sudden 
                roll of his thoughts roused him from his stillness, and made him 
                bound forward with determination to act.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Never despair!&quot; cried he. &quot;A visit to the mill, 
                to say good<br>
                evening to the miller, and good evening to little Babette, can 
                do no<br>
                harm. No one ever fails who has confidence in himself. If I am 
                to be<br>
                Babette's husband, I must see her some time or other.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then Rudy laughed joyously, and took courage to go to the mill. 
                He<br>
                knew what he wanted; he wanted to marry Babette. The clear water 
                of<br>
                the river rolled over its yellow bed, and willows and lime-trees<br>
                were reflected in it, as Rudy stepped along the path to the miller's<br>
                house. But, as the children sing-</p>
              <p> &quot;There was no one at home in the house,<br>
                Only a kitten at play.&quot;</p>
              <p> The cat standing on the steps put up its back and cried &quot;mew.&quot; 
                But<br>
                Rudy had no inclination for this sort of conversation; he passed 
                on,<br>
                and knocked at the door. No one heard him, no one opened the door.<br>
                &quot;Mew,&quot; said the cat again; and had Rudy been still a 
                child, he would<br>
                have understood this language, and known that the cat wished to 
                tell<br>
                him there was no one at home. So he was obliged to go to the mill<br>
                and make inquiries, and there he heard that the miller had gone 
                on a<br>
                journey to Interlachen, and taken Babette with him, to the great<br>
                shooting festival, which began that morning, and would continue 
                for<br>
                eight days, and that people from all the German settlements would 
                be<br>
                there.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Poor Rudy! we may well say. It was not a fortunate day for his<br>
                visit to Bex. He had just to return the way he came, through St.<br>
                Maurice and Sion, to his home in the valley. But he did not despair.<br>
                When the sun rose the next morning, his good spirits had returned;<br>
                indeed he had never really lost them. &quot;Babette is at Interlachen,&quot;<br>
                said Rudy to himself, &quot;many days' journey from here. It is 
                certainly a<br>
                long way for any one who takes the high-road, but not so far if 
                he<br>
                takes a short cut across the mountain, and that just suits a<br>
                chamois-hunter. I have been that way before, for it leads to the<br>
                home of my childhood, where, as a little boy, I lived with my<br>
                grandfather. And there are shooting matches at Interlachen. I 
                will go,<br>
                and try to stand first in the match. Babette will be there, and 
                I<br>
                shall be able to make her acquaintance.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Carrying his light knapsack, which contained his Sunday clothes,<br>
                on his back, and with his musket and his game-bag over his shoulder,<br>
                Rudy started to take the shortest way across the mountain. Still 
                it<br>
                was a great distance. The shooting matches were to commence on 
                that day, and to continue for a whole week. He had been told also 
                that<br>
                the miller and Babette would remain that time with some relatives 
                at<br>
                Interlachen. So over the Gemmi Rudy climbed bravely, and determined 
                to descend the side of the Grindelwald. Bright and joyous were 
                his feelings as he stepped lightly onwards, inhaling the invigorating 
                mountain air. The valley sunk as he ascended, the circle of the 
                horizon expanded. One snow-capped peak after another rose before 
                him, till the whole of the glittering Alpine range became visible.<br>
                Rudy knew each ice-clad peak, and he continued his course towards<br>
                the Schreckhorn, with its white powdered stone finger raised high 
                in<br>
                the air. At length he had crossed the highest ridges, and before 
                him<br>
                lay the green pasture lands sloping down towards the valley, which 
                was once his home. The buoyancy of the air made his heart light. 
                Hill<br>
                and valley were blooming in luxuriant beauty, and his thoughts 
                were<br>
                youthful dreams, in which old age or death were out of the question.<br>
                Life, power, and enjoyment were in the future, and he felt free 
                and<br>
                light as a bird. And the swallows flew round him, as in the days 
                of<br>
                his childhood, singing &quot;We and you- you and we.&quot; All 
                was overflowing with joy. Beneath him lay the meadows, covered 
                with velvety green, with the murmuring river flowing through them, 
                and dotted here and there were small wooden houses. He could see 
                the edges of the glaciers, looking like green glass against the 
                soiled snow, and the deep chasms beneath the loftiest glacier. 
                The church bells were ringing, as if to welcome him to his home 
                with their sweet tones.<br>
                His heart beat quickly, and for a moment he seemed to have<br>
                foregotten Babette, so full were his thoughts of old recollections. 
                He<br>
                was, in imagination, once more wandering on the road where, when 
                a<br>
                little boy, he, with other children, came to sell their curiously<br>
                carved toy houses. Yonder, behind the fir-trees, still stood his<br>
                grandfather's house, his mother's father, but strangers dwelt 
                in it<br>
                now. Children came running to him, as he had once done, and wished<br>
                to sell their wares. One of them offered him an Alpine rose. Rudy 
                took the rose as a good omen, and thought of Babette. He quickly 
                crossed the bridge where the two rivers flow into each other. 
                Here he found a walk over-shadowed with large walnut-trees, and 
                their thick<br>
                foliage formed a pleasant shade. Very soon he perceived in the<br>
                distance, waving flags, on which glittered a white cross on a 
                red<br>
                ground- the standard of the Danes as well as of the Swiss- and<br>
                before him lay Interlachen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is really a splendid town, like none other that I have 
                ever<br>
                seen,&quot; said Rudy to himself. It was indeed a Swiss town in 
                its holiday<br>
                dress. Not like the many other towns, crowded with heavy stone 
                houses, stiff and foreign looking. No; here it seemed as if the 
                wooden<br>
                houses on the hills had run into the valley, and placed themselves<br>
                in rows and ranks by the side of the clear river, which rushes 
                like an<br>
                arrow in its course. The streets were rather irregular, it is 
                true,<br>
                but still this added to their picturesque appearance. There was 
                one<br>
                street which Rudy thought the prettiest of them all; it had been 
                built<br>
                since he had visited the town when a little boy. It seemed to 
                him as<br>
                if all the neatest and most curiously carved toy houses which 
                his<br>
                grandfather once kept in the large cupboard at home, had been<br>
                brought out and placed in this spot, and that they had increased 
                in<br>
                size since then, as the old chestnut trees had done. The houses 
                were<br>
                called hotels; the woodwork on the windows and balconies was curiously 
                carved. The roofs were gayly painted, and before each house was 
                a flower garden, which separated it from the macadamized high-road.<br>
              </p>
              <p>These houses all stood on the same side of the road, so that 
                the<br>
                fresh, green meadows, in which were cows grazing, with bells on<br>
                their necks, were not hidden. The sound of these bells is often<br>
                heard amidst Alpine scenery. These meadows were encircled by lofty<br>
                hills, which receded a little in the centre, so that the most<br>
                beautifully formed of Swiss mountains- the snow-crowned Jungfrau-<br>
                could be distinctly seen glittering in the distance. A number 
                of<br>
                elegantly dressed gentlemen and ladies from foreign lands, and<br>
                crowds of country people from the neighboring cantons, were<br>
                assembled in the town. Each marksman wore the number of hits he 
                had made twisted in a garland round his hat. Here were music and 
                singing of all descriptions: hand-organs, trumpets, shouting, 
                and noise. The houses and bridges were adorned with verses and 
                inscriptions. Flags and banners were waving. Shot after shot was 
                fired, which was the best music to Rudy's ears. And amidst all 
                this excitement he quite forgot Babette, on whose account only 
                he had come. The shooters were thronging round the target, and 
                Rudy was soon amongst them. But when he took his turn to fire, 
                he proved himself the best shot, for he always struck the bull's-eye.<br>
                &quot;Who may that young stranger be?&quot; was the inquiry on 
                all sides.<br>
                &quot;He speaks French as it is spoken in the Swiss cantons.&quot;<br>
                &quot;And makes himself understood very well when he speaks German,&quot;<br>
                said some.<br>
                &quot;He lived here, when a child, with his grandfather, in a 
                house<br>
                on the road to Grindelwald,&quot; remarked one of the sportsmen.<br>
                And full of life was this young stranger; his eyes sparkled, his<br>
                glance was steady, and his arm sure, therefore he always hit the 
                mark.<br>
                Good fortune gives courage, and Rudy was always courageous. He 
                soon had a circle of friends gathered round him. Every one noticed 
                him, and did him homage. Babette had quite vanished from his thoughts, 
                when he was struck on the shoulder by a heavy hand, and a deep 
                voice said to him in French, &quot;You are from the canton Valais.&quot;<br>
                Rudy turned round, and beheld a man with a ruddy, pleasant face,<br>
                and a stout figure. It was the rich miller from Bex. His broad, 
                portly<br>
                person, hid the slender, lovely Babette; but she came forward 
                and<br>
                glanced at him with her bright, dark eyes. The rich miller was 
                very<br>
                much flattered at the thought that the young man, who was acknowledged 
                to be the best shot, and was so praised by every one, should be 
                from his own canton. Now was Rudy really fortunate: he had travelled 
                all this way to this place, and those he had forgotten were now 
                come to seek him. When country people go far from home, they often 
                meet with those they know, and improve their acquaintance. Rudy, 
                by his shooting, had gained the first place in the shooting-match, 
                just as the miller at home at Bex stood first, because of his 
                money and his mill. So the two men shook hands, which they had 
                never done before.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Babette, too, held out her hand to Rudy frankly, and he pressed 
                it<br>
                in his, and looked at her so earnestly, that she blushed deeply. 
                The<br>
                miller talked of the long journey they had travelled, and of the<br>
                many towns they had seen. It was his opinion that he had really 
                made<br>
                as great a journey as if he had travelled in a steamship, a railway<br>
                carriage, or a post-chaise.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I came by a much shorter way,&quot; said Rudy; &quot;I 
                came over the<br>
                mountains. There is no road so high that a man may not venture 
                upon<br>
                it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah, yes; and break your neck,&quot; said the miller; &quot;and 
                you look<br>
                like one who will break his neck some day, you are so daring.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Oh, nothing ever happens to a man if he has confidence in<br>
                himself,&quot; replied Rudy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The miller's relations at Interlachen, with whom the miller and<br>
                Babette were staying, invited Rudy to visit them, when they found 
                he<br>
                came from the same canton as the miller. It was a most pleasant 
                visit.<br>
                Good fortune seemed to follow him, as it does those who think 
                and<br>
                act for themselves, and who remember the proverb, &quot;Nuts are 
                given to us, but they are not cracked for us.&quot; And Rudy was 
                treated by the<br>
                miller's relations almost like one of the family, and glasses 
                of<br>
                wine were poured out to drink to the welfare of the best shooter.<br>
                Babette clinked glasses with Rudy, and he returned thanks for 
                the<br>
                toast. In the evening they all took a delightful walk under the<br>
                walnut-trees, in front of the stately hotels; there were so many<br>
                people, and such crowding, that Rudy was obliged to offer his 
                arm to<br>
                Babette. Then he told her how happy it made him to meet people 
                from the canton Vaud,- for Vaud and Valais were neighboring cantons. 
                He spoke of this pleasure so heartily that Babette could not resist 
                giving his arm a slight squeeze; and so they walked on together, 
                and talked and chatted like old acquaintances. Rudy felt inclined 
                to laugh sometimes at the absurd dress and walk of the foreign 
                ladies; but Babette did not wish to make fun of them, for she 
                knew there must be some good, excellent people amongst them; she, 
                herself, had a godmother, who was a high-born English lady. Eighteen 
                years before, when Babette was christened, this lady was staying 
                at Bex, and she stood godmother for her, and gave her the valuable 
                brooch she now wore in her bosom.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Her godmother had twice written to her, and this year she was<br>
                expected to visit Interlachen with her two daughters; &quot;but 
                they are<br>
                old-maids,&quot; added Babette, who was only eighteen: &quot;they 
                are nearly<br>
                thirty.&quot; Her sweet little mouth was never still a moment, 
                and all that<br>
                she said sounded in Rudy's ears as matters of the greatest importance, 
                and at last he told her what he was longing to tell. How often 
                he had been at Bex, how well he knew the mill, and how often he 
                had seen Babette, when most likely she had not noticed him; and 
                lastly, that full of many thoughts which he could not tell her, 
                he had been to the mill on the evening when she and her father 
                has started on their long journey, but not too far for him to 
                find a way to overtake<br>
                them. He told her all this, and a great deal more; he told her 
                how<br>
                much he could endure for her; and that it was to see her, and 
                not<br>
                the shooting-match, which had brought him to Interlachen. Babette<br>
                became quite silent after hearing all this; it was almost too 
                much,<br>
                and it troubled her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And while they thus wandered on, the sun sunk behind the lofty<br>
                mountains. The Jungfrau stood out in brightness and splendor, 
                as a<br>
                back-ground to the green woods of the surrounding hills. Every 
                one<br>
                stood still to look at the beautiful sight, Rudy and Babette among<br>
                them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Nothing can be more beautiful than this,&quot; said Babette.<br>
                &quot;Nothing!&quot; replied Rudy, looking at Babette.<br>
                &quot;To-morrow I must return home,&quot; remarked Rudy a few 
                minutes<br>
                afterwards.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Come and visit us at Bex,&quot; whispered Babette; &quot;my 
                father will<br>
                be pleased to see you.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>V. ON THE WAY HOME</p>
              <p> Oh, what a number of things Rudy had to carry over the<br>
                mountains, when he set out to return home! He had three silver 
                cups,<br>
                two handsome pistols, and a silver coffee-pot. This latter would 
                be<br>
                useful when he began housekeeping. But all these were not the 
                heaviest weight he had to bear; something mightier and more important 
                he carried with him in his heart, over the high mountains, as 
                he journeyed homeward.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The weather was dismally dark, and inclined to rain; the clouds<br>
                hung low, like a mourning veil on the tops of the mountains, and<br>
                shrouded their glittering peaks. In the woods could be heard the 
                sound of the axe and the heavy fall of the trunks of the trees, 
                as they<br>
                rolled down the slopes of the mountains. When seen from the heights,<br>
                the trunks of these trees looked like slender stems; but on a 
                nearer<br>
                inspection they were found to be large and strong enough for the 
                masts of a ship. The river murmured monotonously, the wind whistled, 
                and the<br>
                clouds sailed along hurriedly.<br>
                Suddenly there appeared, close by Rudy's side, a young maiden;<br>
                he had not noticed her till she came quite near to him. She was 
                also<br>
                going to ascend the mountain. The maiden's eyes shone with an<br>
                unearthly power, which obliged you to look into them; they were<br>
                strange eyes,- clear, deep, and unfathomable.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Hast thou a lover?&quot; asked Rudy; all his thoughts were 
                naturally<br>
                on love just then.<br>
                &quot;I have none,&quot; answered the maiden, with a laugh; it 
                was as if she<br>
                had not spoken the truth.<br>
                &quot;Do not let us go such a long way round,&quot; said she. 
                &quot;We must<br>
                keep to the left; it is much shorter.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; he replied; &quot;and fall into some crevasse. 
                Do you<br>
                pretend to be a guide, and not know the road better than that?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I know every step of the way,&quot; said she; &quot;and 
                my thoughts are<br>
                collected, while yours are down in the valley yonder. We should<br>
                think of the Ice Maiden while we are up here; men say she is not<br>
                kind to their race.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I fear her not,&quot; said Rudy. &quot;She could not keep 
                me when I was a<br>
                child; I will not give myself up to her now I am a man.&quot;<br>
                Darkness came on, the rain fell, and then it began to snow, and<br>
                the whiteness dazzled the eyes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Give me your hand,&quot; said the maiden; &quot;I will 
                help you to<br>
                mount.&quot; And he felt the touch of her icy fingers.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You help me,&quot; cried Rudy; &quot;I do not yet require 
                a woman to help<br>
                me to climb.&quot; And he stepped quickly forwards away from her.<br>
                The drifting snow-shower fell like a veil between them, the wind<br>
                whistled, and behind him he could hear the maiden laughing and<br>
                singing, and the sound was most strange to hear.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It certainly must be a spectre or a servant of the Ice 
                Maiden,&quot;<br>
                thought Rudy, who had heard such things talked about when he was 
                a<br>
                little boy, and had stayed all night on the mountain with the 
                guides.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The snow fell thicker than ever, the clouds lay beneath him; 
                he<br>
                looked back, there was no one to be seen, but he heard sounds 
                of<br>
                mocking laughter, which were not those of a human voice.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When Rudy at length reached the highest part of the mountain,<br>
                where the path led down to the valley of the Rhone, the snow had<br>
                ceased, and in the clear heavens he saw two bright stars twinkling.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They reminded him of Babette and of himself, and of his future<br>
                happiness, and his heart glowed at the thought.<br>
                VI. THE VISIT TO THE MILL</p>
              <p> &quot;What beautiful things you have brought home!&quot; said 
                his old<br>
                foster-mother; and her strange-looking eagle-eyes sparkled, while<br>
                she wriggled and twisted her skinny neck more quickly and strangely<br>
                than ever. &quot;You have brought good luck with you, Rudy. I 
                must give you a kiss, my dear boy.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Rudy allowed himself to be kissed; but it could be seen by his<br>
                countenance that he only endured the infliction as a homely duty.<br>
                &quot;How handsome you are, Rudy!&quot; said the old woman.<br>
                &quot;Don't flatter,&quot; said Rudy, with a laugh; but still 
                he was pleased.<br>
                &quot;I must say once more,&quot; said the old woman, &quot;that 
                you are very<br>
                lucky.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Well, in that I believe you are right,&quot; said he, as 
                he thought of<br>
                Babette. Never had he felt such a longing for that deep valley 
                as he<br>
                now had. &quot;They must have returned home by this time,&quot; 
                said he to<br>
                himself, &quot;it is already two days over the time which they 
                fixed<br>
                upon. I must go to Bex.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So Rudy set out to go to Bex; and when he arrived there, he<br>
                found the miller and his daughter at home. They received him kindly,<br>
                and brought him many greetings from their friends at Interlachen.<br>
                Babette did not say much. She seemed to have become quite silent;<br>
                but her eyes spoke, and that was quite enough for Rudy. The miller 
                had generally a great deal to talk about, and seemed to expect 
                that<br>
                every one should listen to his jokes, and laugh at them; for was 
                not<br>
                he the rich miller? But now he was more inclined to hear Rudy's<br>
                adventures while hunting and travelling, and to listen to his<br>
                descriptions of the difficulties the chamois-hunter has to overcome 
                on<br>
                the mountain-tops, or of the dangerous snow-drifts which the wind<br>
                and weather cause to cling to the edges of the rocks, or to lie 
                in the<br>
                form of a frail bridge over the abyss beneath. The eyes of the 
                brave<br>
                Rudy sparkled as he described the life of a hunter, or spoke of 
                the<br>
                cunning of the chamois and their wonderful leaps; also of the 
                powerful fohn and the rolling avalanche. He noticed that the more 
                he described, the more interested the miller became, especially 
                when he spoke of the fierce vulture and of the royal eagle. Not 
                far from Bex, in the canton Valais, was an eagle's nest, more 
                curiously built under a high, over-hanging rock. In this nest 
                was a young eagle; but who would venture to take it? A young Englishman 
                had offered Rudy a whole handful of gold, if he would bring him 
                the young eagle alive.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There is a liit to everything,&quot; was Rudy's reply. 
                &quot;The eagle<br>
                could not be taken; it would be folly to attempt it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The wine was passed round freely, and the conversation kept up<br>
                pleasantly; but the evening seemed too short for Rudy, although 
                it was midnight when he left the miller's house, after this his 
                first visit.<br>
                While the lights in the windows of the miller's house still<br>
                twinkled through the green foliage, out through the open skylight 
                came the parlor-cat on to the roof, and along the water-pipe walked 
                the kitchen-cat to meet her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What is the news at the mill?&quot; asked the parlor-cat. 
                &quot;Here in the<br>
                house there is secret love-making going on, which the father knows<br>
                nothing about. Rudy and Babette have been treading on each other's<br>
                paws, under the table, all the evening. They trod on my tail twice,<br>
                but I did not mew; that would have attracted notice.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, I should have mewed,&quot; said the kitchen-cat.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What might suit the kitchen would not suit the parlor,&quot; 
                said<br>
                the other. &quot;I am quite curious to know what the miller will 
                say when<br>
                he finds out this engagement.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Yes, indeed; what would the miller say? Rudy himself was anxious<br>
                to know that; but to wait till the miller heard of it from others<br>
                was out of the question. Therefore, not many days after this visit, 
                he<br>
                was riding in the omnibus that runs between the two cantons, Valais<br>
                and Vaud. These cantons are separated by the Rhone, over which 
                is a<br>
                bridge that unites them. Rudy, as usual, had plenty of courage, 
                and<br>
                indulged in pleasant thoughts of the favorable answer he should<br>
                receive that evening. And when the omnibus returned, Rudy was 
                again seated in it, going homewards; and at the same time the 
                parlor-cat at the miller's house ran out quickly, crying,-<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Here, you from the kitchen, what do you think? The miller 
                knows<br>
                all now. Everything has come to a delightful end. Rudy came here<br>
                this evening, and he and Babette had much whispering and secret<br>
                conversation together. They stood in the path near the miller's<br>
                room. I lay at their feet; but they had no eyes or thoughts for 
                me.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'I will go to your father at once,' said he; 'it is the 
                most<br>
                honorable way.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Shall I go with you?' asked Babette; 'it will give you 
                courage.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'I have plenty of courage,' said Rudy; 'but if you are 
                with me,<br>
                he must be friendly, whether he says Yes or No.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;So they turned to go in, and Rudy trod heavily on my tail; 
                he<br>
                certainly is very clumsy. I mewed; but neither he nor Babette 
                had<br>
                any ears for me. They opened the door, and entered together. I 
                was<br>
                before them, and jumped on the back of a chair. I hardly know 
                what<br>
                Rudy said; but the miller flew into a rage, and threatened to 
                kick him<br>
                out of the house. He told him he might go to the mountains, and 
                look<br>
                after the chamois, but not after our little Babette.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And what did they say? Did they speak?&quot; asked the 
                kitchen-cat.<br>
                &quot;What did they say! why, all that people generally do say 
                when<br>
                they go a-wooing- 'I love her, and she loves me; and when there 
                is<br>
                milk in the can for one, there is milk in the can for two.'<br>
                &quot;'But she is so far above you,' said the miller; 'she has 
                heaps of<br>
                gold, as you know. You should not attempt to reach her.'<br>
                &quot;'There is nothing so high that a man cannot reach, if he 
                will,'<br>
                answered Rudy; for he is a brave youth.<br>
                &quot;'Yet you could not reach the young eagle,' said the miller,<br>
                laughing. 'Babette is higher than the eagle's nest.'<br>
                &quot;'I will have them both,' said Rudy.<br>
                &quot;'Very well; I will give her to you when you bring me the 
                young<br>
                eaglet alive,' said the miller; and he laughed till the tears 
                stood in<br>
                his eyes. 'But now I thank you for this visit, Rudy; and if you 
                come<br>
                to-morrow, you will find nobody at home. Good-bye, Rudy.'<br>
                &quot;Babette also wished him farewell; but her voice sounded 
                as<br>
                mournful as the mew of a little kitten that has lost its mother.<br>
                &quot;'A promise is a promise between man and man,' said Rudy. 
                'Do<br>
                not weep, Babette; I shall bring the young eagle.'<br>
                &quot;'You will break your neck, I hope,' said the miller, 'and 
                we<br>
                shall be relieved from your company.'<br>
                &quot;I call that kicking him out of the house,&quot; said the 
                parlor-cat.<br>
                &quot;And now Rudy is gone, and Babette sits and weeps, while 
                the miller<br>
                sings German songs that he learnt on his journey; but I do not 
                trouble<br>
                myself on the matter,- it would be of no use.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Yet, for all that, it is a very strange affair,&quot; said 
                the<br>
                kitchen-cat.<br>
              </p>
              <p>VII. THE EAGLE'S NEST</p>
              <p> From the mountain-path came a joyous sound of some person<br>
                whistling, and it betokened good humor and undaunted courage. 
                It was Rudy, going to meet his friend Vesinaud. &quot;You must 
                come and help,&quot; said he. &quot;I want to carry off the young 
                eaglet from the top of the rock. We will take young Ragli with 
                us.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Had you not better first try to take down the moon? That 
                would be<br>
                quite as easy a task,&quot; said Vesinaud. &quot;You seem to be 
                in good<br>
                spirits.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, indeed I am. I am thinking of my wedding. But to be 
                serious,<br>
                I will tell you all about it, and how I am situated.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then he explained to Vesinaud and Ragli what he wished to do,<br>
                and why.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are a daring fellow,&quot; said they; &quot;but it 
                is no use; you<br>
                will break your neck.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No one falls, unless he is afraid,&quot; said Rudy.<br>
                So at midnight they set out, carrying with them poles, ladders,<br>
                and ropes. The road lay amidst brushwood and underwood, over rolling 
                stones, always upwards higher and higher in the dark night. Waters 
                roared beneath them, or fell in cascades from above. Humid clouds 
                were driving through the air as the hunters reached the precipitous 
                ledge of the rock. It was even darker here, for the sides of the 
                rocks almost met, and the light penetrated only through a small 
                opening at the top. At a little distance from the edge could be 
                heard the sound of the roaring, foaming waters in the yawning 
                abyss beneath them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The three seated themselves on a stone, to await in stillness 
                the dawn<br>
                of day, when the parent eagle would fly out, as it would be<br>
                necessary to shoot the old bird before they could think of gaining<br>
                possession of the young one. Rudy sat motionless, as if he had 
                been<br>
                part of the stone on which he sat. He held his gun ready to fire, 
                with<br>
                his eyes fixed steadily on the highest point of the cliff, where 
                the<br>
                eagle's nest lay concealed beneath the overhanging rock.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The three hunters had a long time to wait. At last they heard 
                a<br>
                rustling, whirring sound above them, and a large hovering object<br>
                darkened the air. Two guns were ready to aim at the dark body 
                of the<br>
                eagle as it rose from the nest. Then a shot was fired; for an<br>
                instant the bird fluttered its wide-spreading wings, and seemed 
                as<br>
                if it would fill up the whole of the chasm, and drag down the<br>
                hunters in its fall. But it was not so; the eagle sunk gradually<br>
                into the abyss beneath, and the branches of trees and bushes were<br>
                broken by its weight. Then the hunters roused themselves: three 
                of the<br>
                longest ladders were brought and bound together; the topmost ring 
                of<br>
                these ladders would just reach the edge of the rock which hung 
                over<br>
                the abyss, but no farther. The point beneath which the eagle's 
                nest<br>
                lay sheltered was much higher, and the sides of the rock were 
                as<br>
                smooth as a wall. After consulting together, they determined to 
                bind<br>
                together two more ladders, and to hoist them over the cavity, 
                and so<br>
                form a communication with the three beneath them, by binding the 
                upper ones to the lower. With great difficulty they contrived 
                to drag the two ladders over the rock, and there they hung for 
                some moments, swaying over the abyss; but no sooner had they fastened 
                them together, than Rudy placed his foot on the lowest step.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was a bitterly cold morning; clouds of mist were rising from<br>
                beneath, and Rudy stood on the lower step of the ladder as a fly 
                rests<br>
                on a piece of swinging straw, which a bird may have dropped from 
                the edge of the nest it was building on some tall factory chimney; 
                but the fly could fly away if the straw were shaken, Rudy could 
                only break his neck. The wind whistled around him, and beneath 
                him the waters of the abyss, swelled by the thawing of the glaciers, 
                those palaces of the Ice Maiden, foamed and roared in their rapid 
                course. </p>
              <p>When Rudy began to ascend, the ladder trembled like the web of 
                the spider, when it draws out the long, delicate threads; but 
                as soon as he<br>
                reached the fourth of the ladders, which had been bound together, 
                he<br>
                felt more confidence,- he knew that they had been fastened securely 
                by skilful hands. The fifth ladder, that appeared to reach the 
                nest,<br>
                was supported by the sides of the rock, yet it swung to and fro, 
                and<br>
                flapped about like a slender reed, and as if it had been bound 
                by<br>
                fishing lines. It seemed a most dangerous undertaking to ascend 
                it,<br>
                but Rudy knew how to climb; he had learnt that from the cat, and 
                he<br>
                had no fear. He did not observe Vertigo, who stood in the air 
                behind<br>
                him, trying to lay hold of him with his outstretched polypous 
                arms.<br>
                When at length he stood on the topmost step of the ladder, he<br>
                found that he was still some distance below the nest, and not 
                even<br>
                able to see into it. Only by using his hands and climbing could 
                he<br>
                possibly reach it. He tried the strength of the stunted trees, 
                and the<br>
                thick underwood upon which the nest rested, and of which it was<br>
                formed, and finding they would support his weight, he grasped 
                them<br>
                firmly, and swung himself up from the ladder till his head and<br>
                breast were above the nest, and then what an overpowering stench<br>
                came from it, for in it lay the putrid remains of lambs, chamois,<br>
                and birds. Vertigo, although he could not reach him, blew the<br>
                poisonous vapor in his face, to make him giddy and faint; and 
                beneath, in the dark, yawning deep, on the rushing waters, sat 
                the Ice<br>
                Maiden, with her long, pale, green hair falling around her, and 
                her<br>
                death-like eyes fixed upon him, like the two barrels of a gun. 
                &quot;I have<br>
                thee now,&quot; she cried.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In a corner of the eagle's nest sat the young eaglet, a large<br>
                and powerful bird, though still unable to fly. Rudy fixed his 
                eyes<br>
                upon it, held on by one hand with all his strength, and with the 
                other<br>
                threw a noose round the young eagle. The string slipped to its 
                legs.<br>
                Rudy tightened it, and thus secured the bird alive. Then flinging<br>
                the sling over his shoulder, so that the creature hung a good 
                way down behind him, he prepared to descend with the help of a 
                rope, and his foot soon touched safely the highest step of the 
                ladder. Then Rudy, remembering his early lesson in climbing, &quot;Hold 
                fast, and do not fear,&quot; descended carefully down the ladders, 
                and at last stood<br>
                safely on the ground with the young living eaglet, where he was<br>
                received with loud shouts of joy and congratulations.<br>
              </p>
              <p>VIII. WHAT FRESH NEWS THE PARLOR-CAT HAD TO TELL</p>
              <p> &quot;There is what you asked for,&quot; said Rudy, as he entered 
                the<br>
                miller's house at Bex, and placed on the floor a large basket. 
                He<br>
                removed the lid as he spoke, and a pair of yellow eyes, encircled 
                by a<br>
                black ring, stared forth with a wild, fiery glance, that seemed<br>
                ready to burn and destroy all that came in its way. Its short,<br>
                strong beak was open, ready to bite, and on its red throat were<br>
                short feathers, like stubble.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The young eaglet!&quot; cried the miller.<br>
                Babette screamed, and started back, while her eyes wandered from<br>
                Rudy to the bird in astonishment.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are not to be discouraged by difficulties, I see,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                miller.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And you will keep your word,&quot; replied Rudy. &quot;Each 
                has his own<br>
                characteristic, whether it is honor or courage.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But how is it you did not break your neck?&quot; asked 
                the miller.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Because I held fast,&quot; answered Rudy; &quot;and I mean 
                to hold fast<br>
                to Babette.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You must get her first,&quot; said the miller, laughing; 
                and Babette<br>
                thought this a very good sign.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We must take the bird out of the basket,&quot; said she. 
                &quot;It is<br>
                getting into a rage; how its eyes glare. How did you manage to 
                conquer it?&quot;<br>
                Then Rudy had to describe his adventure, and the miller's eyes<br>
                opened wide as he listened.<br>
                &quot;With your courage and your good fortune you might win three<br>
                wives,&quot; said the miller.<br>
                &quot;Oh, thank you,&quot; cried Rudy.<br>
                &quot;But you have not won Babette yet,&quot; said the miller, 
                slapping<br>
                the young Alpine hunter on the shoulder playfully.<br>
                &quot;Have you heard the fresh news at the mill?&quot; asked the<br>
                parlor-cat of the kitchen-cat. &quot;Rudy has brought us the young 
                eagle,<br>
                and he is to take Babette in exchange. They kissed each other 
                in the<br>
                presence of the old man, which is as good as an engagement. He 
                was<br>
                quite civil about it; drew in his claws, and took his afternoon 
                nap,<br>
                so that the two were left to sit and wag their tails as much as 
                they<br>
                pleased. They have so much to talk about that it will not be<br>
                finished till Christmas.&quot; Neither was it finished till Christmas.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The wind whirled the faded, fallen leaves; the snow drifted in 
                the<br>
                valleys, as well as upon the mountains, and the Ice Maiden sat 
                in<br>
                the stately palace which, in winter time, she generally occupied.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The perpendicular rocks were covered with slippery ice, and where 
                in<br>
                summer the stream from the rocks had left a watery veil, icicles 
                large<br>
                and heavy hung from the trees, while the snow-powdered fir-trees<br>
                were decorated with fantastic garlands of crystal. The Ice Maiden 
                rode on the howling wind across the deep valleys, the country, 
                as far as Bex, was covered with a carpet of snow, so that the 
                Ice Maiden could follow Rudy, and see him, when he visited the 
                mill; and while in the room at the miller's house, where he was 
                accustomed to spend so much of his time with Babette. The wedding 
                was to take place in the<br>
                following summer, and they heard enough of it, for so many of 
                their<br>
                friends spoke of the matter.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then came sunshine to the mill. The beautiful Alpine roses<br>
                bloomed, and joyous, laughing Babette, was like the early spring,<br>
                which makes all the birds sing of summer time and bridal days.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How those two do sit and chatter together,&quot; said the<br>
                parlor-cat; &quot;I have had enough of their mewing.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>IX. THE ICE MAIDEN</p>
              <p> The walnut and chestnut trees, which extend from the bridge 
                of St.<br>
                Maurice, by the river Rhone, to the shores of the lake of Geneva, 
                were already covered with the delicate green garlands of early 
                spring, just bursting into bloom, while the Rhone rushed wildly 
                from its source among the green glaciers which form the ice palace 
                of the Ice<br>
                Maiden. She sometimes allows herself to be carried by the keen 
                wind to the lofty snow-fields, where she stretches herself in 
                the sunshine<br>
                on the soft snowy-cushions. From thence she throws her far-seeing<br>
                glance into the deep valley beneath, where human beings are busily<br>
                moving about like ants on a stone in the sun. &quot;Spirits of 
                strength, as<br>
                the children of the sun call you,&quot; cried the Ice Maiden, 
                &quot;ye are but<br>
                worms! Let but a snow-ball roll, and you and your houses and your<br>
                towns are crushed and swept away.&quot; And she raised her proud 
                head,<br>
                and looked around her with eyes that flashed death from their<br>
                glance. From the valley came a rumbling sound; men were busily 
                at work blasting the rocks to form tunnels, and laying down roads 
                for the railway. &quot;They are playing at work underground, like 
                moles,&quot; said she.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;They are digging passages beneath the earth, and the noise 
                is like<br>
                the reports of cannons. I shall throw down my palaces, for the<br>
                clamor is louder than the roar of thunder.&quot; Then there ascended 
                from<br>
                the valley a thick vapor, which waved itself in the air like a<br>
                fluttering veil. It rose, as a plume of feathers, from a steam 
                engine,<br>
                to which, on the lately-opened railway, a string of carriages 
                was<br>
                linked, carriage to carriage, looking like a winding serpent. 
                The<br>
                train shot past with the speed of an arrow. &quot;They play at 
                being<br>
                masters down there, those spirits of strength!&quot; exclaimed 
                the Ice<br>
                Maiden; &quot;but the powers of nature are still the rulers.&quot; 
                And she<br>
                laughed and sang till her voice sounded through the valley, and 
                people<br>
                said it was the rolling of an avalanche. But the children of the 
                sun<br>
                sang in louder strains in praise of the mind of man, which can 
                span<br>
                the sea as with a yoke, can level mountains, and fill up valleys. 
                It<br>
                is the power of thought which gives man the mastery over nature.<br>
                Just at this moment there came across the snow-field, where the<br>
                Ice Maiden sat, a party of travellers. They had bound themselves<br>
                fast to each other, so that they looked like one large body on 
                the<br>
                slippery plains of ice encircling the deep abyss.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Worms!&quot; exclaimed the Ice Maiden. &quot;You, the lords 
                of the powers<br>
                of nature!&quot; And she turned away and looked maliciously at 
                the deep<br>
                valley where the railway train was rushing by. &quot;There they 
                sit,<br>
                these thoughts!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;There they sit in their 
                power over<br>
                nature's strength. I see them all. One sits proudly apart, like 
                a<br>
                king; others sit together in a group; yonder, half of them are 
                asleep;<br>
                and when the steam dragon stops, they will get out and go their 
                way.<br>
                The thoughts go forth into the world,&quot; and she laughed.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There goes another avalanche,&quot; said those in the valley 
                beneath.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It will not reach us,&quot; said two who sat together behind 
                the steam<br>
                dragon. &quot;Two hearts and one beat,&quot; as people say. They 
                were Rudy and Babette, and the miller was with them. &quot;I am 
                like the luggage,&quot; said he; &quot;I am here as a necessary 
                appendage.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There sit those two,&quot; said the Ice Maiden. &quot;Many 
                a chamois have I<br>
                crushed. Millions of Alpine roses have I snapped and broken off; 
                not a root have I spared. I know them all, and their thoughts, 
                those spirits<br>
                of strength!&quot; and again she laughed.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There rolls another avalanche,&quot; said those in the 
                valley.<br>
              </p>
              <p>X. THE GODMOTHER</p>
              <p> At Montreux, one of the towns which encircle the northeast part 
                of<br>
                the lake of Geneva, lived Babette's godmother, the noble English 
                lady,<br>
                with her daughters and a young relative. They had only lately 
                arrived,<br>
                yet the miller had paid them a visit, and informed them of Babette's<br>
                engagement to Rudy. The whole story of their meeting at Interlachen,<br>
                and his brave adventure with the eaglet, were related to them, 
                and<br>
                they were all very much interested, and as pleased about Rudy 
                and<br>
                Babette as the miller himself. The three were invited to come 
                to<br>
                Montreux; it was but right for Babette to become acquainted with 
                her<br>
                godmother, who wished to see her very much. A steam-boat started<br>
                from the town of Villeneuve, at one end of the lake of Geneva, 
                and<br>
                arrived at Bernex, a little town beyond Montreux, in about half 
                an<br>
                hour. And in this boat, the miller, with his daughter and Rudy, 
                set<br>
                out to visit her godmother. They passed the coast which has been 
                so<br>
                celebrated in song. Here, under the walnut-trees, by the deep 
                blue<br>
                lake, sat Byron, and wrote his melodious verses about the prisoner<br>
                confined in the gloomy castle of Chillon. Here, where Clarens, 
                with<br>
                its weeping-willows, is reflected in the clear water, wandered<br>
                Rousseau, dreaming of Heloise. The river Rhone glides gently by<br>
                beneath the lofty snow-capped hills of Savoy, and not far from 
                its<br>
                mouth lies a little island in the lake, so small that, seen from 
                the<br>
                shore, it looks like a ship. The surface of the island is rocky; 
                and<br>
                about a hundred years ago, a lady caused the ground to be covered 
                with earth, in which three acacia-trees were planted, and the 
                whole<br>
                enclosed with stone walls. The acacia-trees now overshadow every<br>
                part of the island. Babette was enchanted with the spot; it seemed<br>
                to her the most beautiful object in the whole voyage, and she<br>
                thought how much she should like to land there. But the steam-ship<br>
                passed it by, and did not stop till it reached Bernex. The little<br>
                party walked slowly from this place to Montreux, passing the sun-lit<br>
                walls with which the vineyards of the little mountain town of 
                Montreux are surrounded, and peasants' houses, overshadowed by 
                fig-trees, with gardens in which grow the laurel and the cypress.<br>
                Halfway up the hill stood the boarding-house in which Babette's<br>
                godmother resided. She was received most cordially; her godmother<br>
                was a very friendly woman, with a round, smiling countenance. 
                When a child, her head must have resembled one of Raphael's cherubs; 
                it was still an angelic face, with its white locks of silvery 
                hair. The<br>
                daughters were tall, elegant, slender maidens.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The young cousin, whom they had brought with them, was dressed<br>
                in white from head to foot; he had golden hair and golden whiskers,<br>
                large enough to be divided amongst three gentlemen; and he began<br>
                immediately to pay the greatest attention to Babette.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Richly bound books, note-paper, and drawings, lay on the large<br>
                table. The balcony window stood open, and from it could be seen 
                the<br>
                beautiful wide extended lake, the water so clear and still, that 
                the<br>
                mountains of Savoy, with their villages, woods, and snow-crowned<br>
                peaks, were clearly reflected in it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Rudy, who was usually so lively and brave, did not in the least<br>
                feel himself at home; he acted as if he were walking on peas, 
                over a<br>
                slippery floor. How long and wearisome the time appeared; it was<br>
                like being in a treadmill. And then they went out for a walk, 
                which<br>
                was very slow and tedious. Two steps forward and one backwards 
                had Rudy to take to keep pace with the others. They walked down 
                to<br>
                Chillon, and went over the old castle on the rocky island. They 
                saw<br>
                the implements of torture, the deadly dungeons, the rusty fetters 
                in<br>
                the rocky walls, the stone benches for those condemned to death, 
                the<br>
                trap-doors through which the unhappy creatures were hurled upon 
                iron spikes, and impaled alive. They called looking at all these 
                a<br>
                pleasure. It certainly was the right place to visit. Byron's poetry<br>
                had made it celebrated in the world. Rudy could only feel that 
                it<br>
                was a place of execution. He leaned against the stone framework 
                of the window, and gazed down into the deep, blue water, and over 
                to the little island with the three acacias, and wished himself 
                there, away<br>
                and free from the whole chattering party. But Babette was most<br>
                unusually lively and good-tempered.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I have been so amused,&quot; she said.<br>
                The cousin had found her quite perfect.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He is a perfect fop,&quot; said Rudy; and this was the 
                first time Rudy<br>
                had said anything that did not please Babette.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Englishman had made her a present of a little book, in<br>
                remembrance of their visit to Chillon. It was Byron's poem, &quot;The<br>
                Prisoner of Chillon,&quot; translated into French, so that Babette 
                could<br>
                read it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The book may be very good,&quot; said Rudy; &quot;but that 
                finely combed<br>
                fellow who gave it to you is not worth much.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He looks something like a flour-sack without any flour,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                miller, laughing at his own wit. Rudy laughed, too, for so had 
                he<br>
                appeared to him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>XI. THE COUSIN</p>
              <p> When Rudy went a few days after to pay a visit to the mill, 
                he<br>
                found the young Englishman there. Babette was just thinking of<br>
                preparing some trout to set before him. She understood well how 
                to<br>
                garnish the dish with parsley, and make it look quite tempting. 
                Rudy<br>
                thought all this quite unnecessary. What did the Englishman want<br>
                there? What was he about? Why should he be entertained, and waited<br>
                upon by Babette? Rudy was jealous, and that made Babette happy. 
                It<br>
                amused her to discover all the feelings of his heart; the strong<br>
                points and weak ones. Love was to her as yet only a pastime, and 
                she<br>
                played with Rudy's whole heart. At the same time it must be<br>
                acknowledged that her fortune, her whole life, her inmost thoughts,<br>
                her best and most noble feelings in this world were all for him. 
                Still<br>
                the more gloomy he looked, the more her eyes laughed. She could 
                almost have kissed the fair Englishman, with the golden whiskers, 
                if by so doing she could have put Rudy in a rage, and made him 
                run out of the house. That would have proved how much he loved 
                her. All this was not right in Babette, but she was only nineteen 
                years of age, and she did not reflect on what she did, neither 
                did she think that her<br>
                conduct would appear to the young Englishman as light, and not 
                even<br>
                becoming the modest and much-loved daughter of the miller.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The mill at Bex stood in the highway, which passed under the<br>
                snow-clad mountains, and not far from a rapid mountain-stream, 
                whose waters seemed to have been lashed into a foam like soap-suds. 
              </p>
              <p>This stream, however, did not pass near enough to the mill, and 
                therefore the mill-wheel was turned by a smaller stream which 
                tumbled down the rocks on the opposite side, where it was opposed 
                by a stone mill-dam, and obtained greater strength and speed, 
                till it fell into a large basin, and from thence through a channel 
                to the mill-wheel. </p>
              <p>This channel sometimes overflowed, and made the path so slippery 
                that any one passing that way might easily fall in, and be carried 
                towards the mill wheel with frightful rapidity. Such a catastrophe 
                nearly happened to the young Englishman. He had dressed himself 
                in white clothes, like a miller's man, and was climbing the path 
                to the<br>
                miller's house, but he had never been taught to climb, and therefore<br>
                slipped, and nearly went in head-foremost. He managed, however, 
                to<br>
                scramble out with wet sleeves and bespattered trousers. Still, 
                wet and<br>
                splashed with mud, he contrived to reach Babette's window, to 
                which he had been guided by the light that shone from it. Here 
                he climbed the old linden-tree that stood near it, and began to 
                imitate the voice<br>
                of an owl, the only bird he could venture to mimic. Babette heard<br>
                the noise, and glanced through the thin window curtain; but when 
                she<br>
                saw the man in white, and guessed who he was, her little heart 
                beat<br>
                with terror as well as anger. She quickly put out the light, felt 
                if<br>
                the fastening of the window was secure, and then left him to howl 
                as<br>
                long as he liked. How dreadful it would be, thought Babette, if 
                Rudy<br>
                were here in the house. But Rudy was not in the house. No, it 
                was much worse, he was outside, standing just under the linden-tree. 
                He was speaking loud, angry words. He could fight, and there might 
                be murder!<br>
              </p>
              <p>Babette opened the window in alarm, and called Rudy's name; she 
                told him to go away, she did not wish him to remain there.<br>
                &quot;You do not wish me to stay,&quot; cried he; &quot;then this 
                is an<br>
                appointment you expected- this good friend whom you prefer to 
                me.<br>
                Shame on you, Babette!&quot;<br>
                &quot;You are detestable!&quot; exclaimed Babette, bursting into 
                tears.<br>
                &quot;Go away. I hate you.&quot;<br>
                &quot;I have not deserved this,&quot; said Rudy, as he turned 
                away, his<br>
                cheeks burning, and his heart like fire.<br>
                Babette threw herself on the bed, and wept bitterly. &quot;So 
                much as I<br>
                loved thee, Rudy, and yet thou canst think ill of me.&quot;<br>
                Thus her anger broke forth; it relieved her, however: otherwise<br>
                she would have been more deeply grieved; but now she could sleep<br>
                soundly, as youth only can sleep.<br>
              </p>
              <p>XII. EVIL POWERS</p>
              <p> Rudy left Bex, and took his way home along the mountain path.<br>
                The air was fresh, but cold; for here amidst the deep snow, the 
                Ice<br>
                Maiden reigned. He was so high up that the large trees beneath 
                him,<br>
                with their thick foliage, appeared like garden plants, and the 
                pines<br>
                and bushes even less. The Alpine roses grew near the snow, which 
                lay in detached stripes, and looked like linen laid out to bleach. 
                A<br>
                blue gentian grew in his path, and he crushed it with the butt 
                end<br>
                of his gun. A little higher up, he espied two chamois. Rudy's 
                eyes<br>
                glistened, and his thoughts flew at once in a different direction; 
                but<br>
                he was not near enough to take a sure aim. He ascended still higher,<br>
                to a spot where a few rough blades of grass grew between the blocks 
                of stone and the chamois passed quietly on over the snow-fields. 
              </p>
              <p>Rudy walked hurriedly, while the clouds of mist gathered round 
                him.<br>
                Suddenly he found himself on the brink of a precipitous rock. 
                The rain was falling in torrents. He felt a burning thirst, his 
                head was hot,<br>
                and his limbs trembled with cold. He seized his hunting-flask, 
                but<br>
                it was empty; he had not thought of filling it before ascending 
                the<br>
                mountain. He had never been ill in his life, nor ever experienced 
                such<br>
                sensations as those he now felt. He was so tired that he could<br>
                scarcely resist lying down at his full length to sleep, although 
                the<br>
                ground was flooded with the rain. Yet when he tried to rouse himself 
                a little, every object around him danced and trembled before his 
                eyes.<br>
                Suddenly he observed in the doorway of a hut newly built under 
                the<br>
                rock, a young maiden. He did not remember having seen this hut 
                before, yet there it stood; and he thought, at first, that the 
                young maiden was Annette, the schoolmaster's daughter, whom he 
                had once kissed in the dance. The maiden was not Annette; yet 
                it seemed as if he had seen<br>
                her somewhere before, perhaps near Grindelwald, on the evening 
                of<br>
                his return home from Interlachen, after the shooting-match.<br>
                &quot;How did you come here?&quot; he asked.<br>
                &quot;I am at home,&quot; she replied; &quot;I am watching my 
                flocks.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Your flocks!&quot; he exclaimed; &quot;where do they find 
                pasture? There is<br>
                nothing here but snow and rocks.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Much you know of what grows here,&quot; she replied, laughing. 
                &quot;not<br>
                far beneath us there is beautiful pasture-land. My goats go there. 
                I<br>
                tend them carefully; I never miss one. What is once mine remains<br>
                mine.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are bold,&quot; said Rudy.<br>
                &quot;And so are you,&quot; she answered.<br>
                &quot;Have you any milk in the house?&quot; he asked; &quot;if 
                so, give me some<br>
                to drink; my thirst is intolerable.&quot;<br>
                &quot;I have something better than milk,&quot; she replied, &quot;which 
                I will<br>
                give you. Some travellers who were here yesterday with their guide<br>
                left behind them a half a flask of wine, such as you have never<br>
                tasted. They will not come back to fetch it, I know, and I shall 
                not<br>
                drink it; so you shall have it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the maiden went to fetch the wine, poured some into a<br>
                wooden cup, and offered it to Rudy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How good it is!&quot; said he; &quot;I have never before 
                tasted such<br>
                warm, invigorating wine.&quot; And his eyes sparkled with new 
                life; a<br>
                glow diffused itself over his frame; it seemed as if every sorrow,<br>
                every oppression were banished from his mind, and a fresh, free 
                nature were stirring within him. &quot;You are surely Annette, 
                the<br>
                schoolmaster's daughter,&quot; cried he; &quot;will you give me 
                a kiss?&quot;<br>
                &quot;Yes, if you will give me that beautiful ring which you wear 
                on<br>
                your finger.&quot;<br>
                &quot;My betrothal ring?&quot; he replied.<br>
                &quot;Yes, just so,&quot; said the maiden, as she poured out some 
                more wine,<br>
                and held it to his lips. Again he drank, and a living joy streamed<br>
                through every vein.<br>
                &quot;The whole world is mine, why therefore should I grieve?&quot;<br>
                thought he. &quot;Everything is created for our enjoyment and 
                happiness.<br>
                The stream of life is a stream of happiness; let us flow on with 
                it to<br>
                joy and felicity.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Rudy gazed on the young maiden; it was Annette, and yet it was 
                not<br>
                Annette; still less did he suppose it was the spectral phantom, 
                whom<br>
                he had met near Grindelwald. The maiden up here on the mountain 
                was fresh as the new fallen snow, blooming as an Alpine rose, 
                and as<br>
                nimble-footed as a young kid. Still, she was one of Adam's race,<br>
                like Rudy. He flung his arms round the beautiful being, and gazed 
                into<br>
                her wonderfully clear eyes,- only for a moment; but in that moment<br>
                words cannot express the effect of his gaze. Was it the spirit 
                of life<br>
                or of death that overpowered him? Was he rising higher, or sinking<br>
                lower and lower into the deep, deadly abyss? He knew not; but 
                the<br>
                walls of ice shone like blue-green glass; innumerable clefts yawned<br>
                around him, and the water-drops tinkled like the chiming of church<br>
                bells, and shone clearly as pearls in the light of a pale-blue<br>
                flame. The Ice Maiden, for she it was, kissed him, and her kiss 
                sent a<br>
                chill as of ice through his whole frame. A cry of agony escaped 
                from<br>
                him; he struggled to get free, and tottered from her. For a moment 
                all<br>
                was dark before his eyes, but when he opened them again it was<br>
                light, and the Alpine maiden had vanished. The powers of evil 
                had<br>
                played their game; the sheltering hut was no more to be seen. 
                The<br>
                water trickled down the naked sides of the rocks, and snow lay 
                thickly all around. Rudy shivered with cold; he was wet through 
                to the skin; and his ring was gone,- the betrothal ring that Babette 
                had given him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>His gun lay near him in the snow; he took it up and tried to 
                discharge<br>
                it, but it missed fire. Heavy clouds lay on the mountain clefts,<br>
                like firm masses of snow. Upon one of these Vertigo sat, lurking 
                after<br>
                his powerless prey, and from beneath came a sound as if a piece 
                of<br>
                rock had fallen from the cleft, and was crushing everything that 
                stood<br>
                in its way or opposed its course.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But, at the miller's, Babette sat alone and wept. Rudy had not<br>
                been to see her for six days. He who was in the wrong, and who 
                ought to ask her forgiveness; for did she not love him with her 
                whole heart?<br>
              </p>
              <p>XIII. AT THE MILL</p>
              <p> &quot;What strange creatures human beings are,&quot; said the 
                parlor-cat<br>
                to the kitchen-cat; &quot;Babette and Rudy have fallen out with 
                each other.<br>
                She sits and cries, and he thinks no more about her.&quot;<br>
                &quot;That does not please me to hear,&quot; said the kitchen-cat.<br>
                &quot;Nor me either,&quot; replied the parlor-cat; &quot;but I 
                do not take it<br>
                to heart. Babette may fall in love with the red whiskers, if she<br>
                likes, but he has not been here since he tried to get on the roof.&quot;<br>
                The powers of evil carry on their game both around us and within<br>
                us. Rudy knew this, and thought a great deal about it. What was 
                it<br>
                that had happened to him on the mountain? Was it really a ghostly<br>
                apparition, or a fever dream? Rudy knew nothing of fever, or any 
                other ailment. But, while he judged Babette, he began to examine 
                his own conduct. He had allowed wild thoughts to chase each other 
                in his heart, and a fierce tornado to break loose. Could he confess 
                to<br>
                Babette, indeed, every thought which in the hour of temptation 
                might<br>
                have led him to wrong doing? He had lost her ring, and that very<br>
                loss had won him back to her. Could she expect him to confess? 
                He felt as if his heart would break while he thought of it, and 
                while so<br>
                many memories lingered on his mind. He saw her again, as she once<br>
                stood before him, a laughing, spirited child; many loving words, 
                which she had spoken to him out of the fulness of her love, came 
                like a ray of sunshine into his heart, and soon it was all sunshine 
                as he<br>
                thought of Babette. But she must also confess she was wrong; that<br>
                she should do.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He went to the mill- he went to confession. It began with a<br>
                kiss, and ended with Rudy being considered the offender. It was 
                such a great fault to doubt Babette's truth- it was most abominable 
                of him.<br>
                Such mistrust, such violence, would cause them both great unhappiness.<br>
              </p>
              <p>This certainly was very true, she knew that; and therefore Babette<br>
                preached him a little sermon, with which she was herself much<br>
                amused, and during the preaching of which she looked quite lovely. 
              </p>
              <p>She acknowledged, however, that on one point Rudy was right. 
                Her<br>
                godmother's nephew was a fop: she intended to burn the book which 
                he had given her, so that not the slightest thing should remain 
                to remind her of him.<br>
                &quot;Well, that quarrel is all over,&quot; said the kitchen-cat. 
                &quot;Rudy is<br>
                come back, and they are friends again, which they say is the<br>
                greatest of all pleasures.&quot;<br>
                &quot;I heard the rats say one night,&quot; said the kitchen-cat, 
                &quot;that<br>
                the greatest pleasure in the world was to eat tallow candles and 
                to<br>
                feast on rancid bacon. Which are we to believe, the rats or the<br>
                lovers?&quot;<br>
                &quot;Neither of them,&quot; said the parlor-cat; &quot;it is 
                always the safest<br>
                plan to believe nothing you hear.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The greatest happiness was coming for Rudy and Babette. The<br>
                happy day, as it is called, that is, their wedding-day, was near 
                at<br>
                hand. They were not to be married at the church at Bex, nor at 
                the<br>
                miller's house; Babette's godmother wished the nuptials to be<br>
                solemnized at Montreux, in the pretty little church in that town.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The miller was very anxious that this arrangement should be agreed 
                to.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He alone knew what the newly-married couple would receive from<br>
                Babette's godmother, and he knew also that it was a wedding present<br>
                well worth a concession. The day was fixed, and they were to travel 
                as far as Villeneuve the evening before, to be in time for the 
                steamer<br>
                which sailed in the morning for Montreux, and the godmother's<br>
                daughters were to dress and adorn the bride.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Here in this house there ought to be a wedding-day kept,&quot; 
                said<br>
                the parlor-cat, &quot;or else I would not give a mew for the whole 
                affair.&quot;<br>
                &quot;There is going to be great feasting,&quot; replied the kitchen-cat.<br>
                &quot;Ducks and pigeons have been killed, and a whole roebuck 
                hangs on<br>
                the wall. It makes me lick my lips when I think of it.&quot;<br>
                &quot;To-morrow morning they will begin the journey.&quot;<br>
                Yes, to-morrow! And this evening, for the last time, Rudy and<br>
                Babette sat in the miller's house as an engaged couple. Outside, 
                the<br>
                Alps glowed in the evening sunset, the evening bells chimed, and 
                the<br>
                children of the sunbeam sang, &quot;Whatever happens is best.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>XIV. NIGHT VISIONS</p>
              <p> The sun had gone down, and the clouds lay low on the valley 
                of the<br>
                Rhone. The wind blew from the south across the mountains; it was 
                an<br>
                African wind, a wind which scattered the clouds for a moment, 
                and then suddenly fell. The broken clouds hung in fantastic forms 
                upon the wood-covered hills by the rapid Rhone. They assumed the 
                shapes of antediluvian animals, of eagles hovering in the air, 
                of frogs<br>
                leaping over a marsh, and then sunk down upon the rushing stream 
                and appeared to sail upon it, although floating in the air. An 
                uprooted<br>
                fir-tree was being carried away by the current, and marking out 
                its<br>
                path by eddying circles on the water. Vertigo and his sisters 
                were<br>
                dancing upon it, and raising these circles on the foaming river. 
                The<br>
                moon lighted up the snow on the mountain-tops, shone on the dark<br>
                woods, and on the drifting clouds those fantastic forms which 
                at night might be taken for spirits of the powers of nature. The<br>
                mountain-dweller saw them through the panes of his little window. 
              </p>
              <p>They sailed in hosts before the Ice Maiden as she came out of 
                her palace of ice. Then she seated herself on the trunk of the 
                fir-tree as on a broken skiff, and the water from the glaciers 
                carried her down the<br>
                river to the open lake.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The wedding guests are coming,&quot; sounded from air and 
                sea. These<br>
                were the sights and sounds without; within there were visions, 
                for<br>
                Babette had a wonderful dream. She dreamt that she had been married 
                to Rudy for many years, and that, one day when he was out chamois 
                hunting, and she alone in their dwelling at home, the young Englishman<br>
                with the golden whiskers sat with her. His eyes were quite eloquent,<br>
                and his words possessed a magic power; he offered her his hand, 
                and<br>
                she was obliged to follow him. They went out of the house and<br>
                stepped downwards, always downwards, and it seemed to Babette 
                as if she had a weight on her heart which continually grew heavier. 
                She felt she was committing a sin against Rudy, a sin against 
                God. </p>
              <p>Suddenly she found herself forsaken, her clothes torn by the 
                thorns, and her hair gray; she looked upwards in her agony, and 
                there, on the edge of the rock, she espied Rudy. She stretched 
                out her arms to him, but she did not venture to call him or to 
                pray; and had she called him, it would have been useless, for 
                it was not Rudy, only his hunting coat and hat hanging on an alpenstock, 
                as the hunters sometimes arrange them to deceive the chamois. 
                &quot;Oh!&quot; she exclaimed in her agony; &quot;oh, that I had 
                died on the happiest day of my life, my wedding-day. O my God, 
                it would have been a mercy and a blessing had Rudy travelled far 
                away from me, and I had never known him. None know what will happen 
                in the future.&quot; And then, in ungodly despair, she cast herself 
                down into the deep rocky gulf. The spell was broken; a cry of 
                terror escaped her, and she awoke.<br>
                The dream was over; it had vanished. But she knew she had dreamt<br>
                something frightful about the young Englishman, yet months had<br>
                passed since she had seen him or even thought of him. Was he still<br>
                at Montreux, and should she meet him there on her wedding day? 
                A<br>
                slight shadow passed over her pretty mouth as she thought of this, 
                and she knit her brows; but the smile soon returned to her lip, 
                and joy<br>
                sparkled in her eyes, for this was the morning of the day on which 
                she<br>
                and Rudy were to be married, and the sun was shining brightly. 
                Rudy<br>
                was already in the parlor when she entered it, and they very soon<br>
                started for Villeneuve. Both of them were overflowing with<br>
                happiness, and the miller was in the best of tempers, laughing 
                and<br>
                merry; he was a good, honest soul, and a kind father.<br>
                &quot;Now we are masters of the house,&quot; said the parlor-cat.<br>
              </p>
              <p>XV. THE CONCLUSION</p>
              <p> It was early in the afternoon, and just at dinner-time, when 
                the<br>
                three joyous travellers reached Villeneuve. After dinner, the 
                miller<br>
                placed himself in the arm-chair, smoked his pipe, and had a little<br>
                nap. The bridal pair went arm-in-arm out through the town and 
                along<br>
                the high road, at the foot of the wood-covered rocks, and by the 
                deep, blue lake.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The gray walls, and the heavy clumsy-looking towers of the<br>
                gloomy castle of Chillon, were reflected in the clear flood. The<br>
                little island, on which grew the three acacias, lay at a short<br>
                distance, looking like a bouquet rising from the lake. &quot;How 
                delightful<br>
                it must be to live there,&quot; said Babette, who again felt the 
                greatest<br>
                wish to visit the island; and an opportunity offered to gratify 
                her<br>
                wish at once, for on the shore lay a boat, and the rope by which 
                it<br>
                was moored could be very easily loosened. They saw no one near, 
                so<br>
                they took possession of it without asking permission of any one, 
                and<br>
                Rudy could row very well. The oars divided the pliant water like 
                the<br>
                fins of a fish- that water which, with all its yielding softness, 
                is<br>
                so strong to bear and to carry, so mild and smiling when at rest,<br>
                and yet so terrible in its destroying power. A white streak of 
                foam<br>
                followed in the wake of the boat, which, in a few minutes, carried<br>
                them both to the little island, where they went on shore; but 
                there<br>
                was only just room enough for two to dance. Rudy swung Babette 
                round two or three times; and then, hand-in-hand, they sat down 
                on a<br>
                little bench under the drooping acacia-tree, and looked into each<br>
                other's eyes, while everything around them glowed in the rays 
                of the<br>
                setting sun.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The fir-tree forests on the mountains were covered with a purple<br>
                hue like the heather bloom; and where the woods terminated, and 
                the<br>
                rocks became prominent, they looked almost transparent in the 
                rich<br>
                crimson glow of the evening sky. The surface of the lake was like 
                a<br>
                bed of pink rose-leaves.<br>
              </p>
              <p>As the evening advanced, the shadows fell upon the snow-capped<br>
                mountains of Savoy painting them in colors of deep blue, while 
                their<br>
                topmost peaks glowed like red lava; and for a moment this light 
                was<br>
                reflected on the cultivated parts of the mountains, making them 
                appear as if newly risen from the lap of earth, and giving to 
                the<br>
                snow-crested peak of the Dent du Midi the appearance of the full<br>
                moon as it rises above the horizon.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Rudy and Babette felt that they had never seen the Alpine glow<br>
                in such perfection before. &quot;How very beautiful it is, and 
                what<br>
                happiness to be here!&quot; exclaimed Babette.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Earth has nothing more to bestow upon me,&quot; said Rudy; 
                &quot;an evening<br>
                like this is worth a whole life. Often have I realized my good<br>
                fortune, but never more than in this moment. I feel that if my<br>
                existence were to end now, I should still have lived a happy life.<br>
                What a glorious world this is; one day ends, and another begins 
                even<br>
                more beautiful than the last. How infinitely good God is, Babette!&quot;<br>
                &quot;I have such complete happiness in my heart,&quot; said she.<br>
                &quot;Earth has no more to bestow,&quot; answered Rudy. And then 
                came the<br>
                sound of the evening bells, borne upon the breeze over the mountains<br>
                of Switzerland and Savoy, while still, in the golden splendor 
                of the<br>
                west, stood the dark blue mountains of Jura.<br>
                &quot;God grant you all that is brightest and best!&quot; exclaimed 
                Babette.<br>
                &quot;He will,&quot; said Rudy. &quot;He will to-morrow. To-morrow 
                you will be<br>
                wholly mine, my own sweet wife.&quot;<br>
                &quot;The boat!&quot; cried Babette, suddenly. The boat in which 
                they were<br>
                to return had broken loose, and was floating away from the island.<br>
                &quot;I will fetch it back,&quot; said Rudy; throwing off his 
                coat and<br>
                boots, he sprang into the lake, and swam with strong efforts towards<br>
                it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The dark-blue water, from the glaciers of the mountains, was 
                icy<br>
                cold and very deep. Rudy gave but one glance into the water beneath;<br>
                but in that one glance he saw a gold ring rolling, glittering, 
                and<br>
                sparkling before him. His engaged ring came into his mind; but 
                this<br>
                was larger, and spread into a glittering circle, in which appeared 
                a<br>
                clear glacier. Deep chasms yawned around it, the water-drops glittered 
                as if lighted with blue flame, and tinkled like the chiming of<br>
                church bells. In one moment he saw what would require many words 
                to describe. Young hunters, and young maidens- men and women who 
                had sunk in the deep chasms of the glaciers- stood before him 
                here in lifelike forms, with eyes open and smiles on their lips; 
                and far<br>
                beneath them could be heard the chiming of the church bells of<br>
                buried villages, where the villagers knelt beneath the vaulted<br>
                arches of churches in which ice-blocks formed the organ pipes, 
                and the mountain stream the music.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On the clear, transparent ground sat the Ice Maiden. She raised<br>
                herself towards Rudy, and kissed his feet; and instantly a cold,<br>
                deathly chill, like an electric shock, passed through his limbs. 
                Ice<br>
                or fire! It was impossible to tell, the shock was so instantaneous.<br>
                &quot;Mine! mine!&quot; sounded around him, and within him; &quot;I 
                kissed thee<br>
                when thou wert a little child. I once kissed thee on the mouth, 
                and<br>
                now I have kissed thee from heel to toe; thou art wholly mine.&quot; 
                And<br>
                then he disappeared in the clear, blue water.<br>
              </p>
              <p>All was still. The church bells were silent; the last tone floated<br>
                away with the last red glimmer on the evening clouds. &quot;Thou 
                art mine,&quot; sounded from the depths below: but from the heights 
                above, from the eternal world, also sounded the words, &quot;Thou 
                art mine!&quot; Happy was he thus to pass from life to life, from 
                earth to heaven. A chord was loosened, and tones of sorrow burst 
                forth. The icy kiss of death had overcome the perishable body; 
                it was but the prelude before life's real drama could begin, the 
                discord which was quickly lost in harmony.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Do you think this a sad story? Poor Babette! for her it was<br>
                unspeakable anguish.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The boat drifted farther and farther away. No one on the<br>
                opposite shore knew that the betrothed pair had gone over to the<br>
                little island. The clouds sunk as the evening drew on, and it 
                became<br>
                dark. Alone, in despair, she waited and trembled. The weather 
                became fearful; flash after flash lighted up the mountains of 
                Jura, Savoy, and Switzerland, while peals of thunder, that lasted 
                for many minutes rolled over her head. The lightning was so vivid 
                that every single vine stem could be seen for a moment as distinctly 
                as in the<br>
                sunlight at noon-day; and then all was veiled in darkness. It<br>
                flashed across the lake in winding, zigzag lines, lighting it 
                up on<br>
                all sides; while the echoes of the thunder grew louder and stronger.<br>
                On land, the boats were all carefully drawn up on the beach, every<br>
                living thing sought shelter, and at length the rain poured down 
                in<br>
                torrents.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Where can Rudy and Babette be in this awful weather?&quot; 
                said the<br>
                miller.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Poor Babette sat with her hands clasped, and her head bowed<br>
                down, dumb with grief; she had ceased to weep and cry for help.<br>
                &quot;In the deep water!&quot; she said to herself; &quot;far 
                down he lies, as if<br>
                beneath a glacier.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Deep in her heart rested the memory of what Rudy had told her 
                of<br>
                the death of his mother, and of his own recovery, even after he 
                had<br>
                been taken up as dead from the cleft in the glacier.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah,&quot; she thought, &quot;the Ice Maiden has him at 
                last.&quot;<br>
                Suddenly there came a flash of lightning, as dazzling as the<br>
                rays of the sun on the white snow. The lake rose for a moment 
                like a<br>
                shining glacier; and before Babette stood the pallid, glittering,<br>
                majestic form of the Ice Maiden, and at her feet lay Rudy's corpse.<br>
                &quot;Mine!&quot; she cried, and again all was darkness around 
                the heaving<br>
                water.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How cruel,&quot; murmured Babette; &quot;why should he 
                die just as the<br>
                day of happiness drew near? Merciful God, enlighten my<br>
                understanding, shed light upon my heart; for I cannot comprehend 
                the<br>
                arrangements of Thy providence, even while I bow to the decree 
                of<br>
                Thy almighty wisdom and power.&quot; And God did enlighten her 
                heart.<br>
              </p>
              <p>A sudden flash of thought, like a ray of mercy, recalled her 
                dream<br>
                of the preceding night; all was vividly represented before her. 
                She<br>
                remembered the words and wishes she had then expressed, that what<br>
                was best for her and for Rudy she might piously submit to.<br>
                &quot;Woe is me,&quot; she said; &quot;was the germ of sin really 
                in my heart?<br>
                was my dream a glimpse into the course of my future life, whose 
                thread must be violently broken to rescue me from sin? Oh, miserable 
                creature that I am!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Thus she sat lamenting in the dark night, while through the deep<br>
                stillness the last words of Rudy seemed to ring in her ears. &quot;This<br>
                earth has nothing more to bestow.&quot; Words, uttered in the 
                fulness of<br>
                joy, were again heard amid the depths of sorrow.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Years have passed since this sad event happened. The shores of 
                the<br>
                peaceful lake still smile in beauty. The vines are full of luscious<br>
                grapes. Steamboats, with waving flags, pass swiftly by.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Pleasure-boats, with their swelling sails, skim lightly over 
                the<br>
                watery mirror, like white butterflies. The railway is opened beyond<br>
                Chillon, and goes far into the deep valley of the Rhone. At every<br>
                station strangers alight with red-bound guide-books in their hands, 
                in<br>
                which they read of every place worth seeing. They visit Chillon, 
                and<br>
                observe on the lake the little island with the three acacias, 
                and then<br>
                read in their guide-book the story of the bridal pair who, in 
                the year<br>
                1856, rowed over to it. They read that the two were missing till 
                the<br>
                next morning, when some people on the shore heard the despairing 
                cries of the bride, and went to her assistance, and by her were 
                told of<br>
                the bridegroom's fate.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the guide-book does not speak of Babette's quiet life<br>
                afterwards with her father, not at the mill- strangers dwell there<br>
                now- but in a pretty house in a row near the station. On many 
                an<br>
                evening she sits at her window, and looks out over the<br>
                chestnut-trees to the snow-capped mountains on which Rudy once 
                roamed.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She looks at the Alpine glow in the evening sky, which is caused 
                by<br>
                the children of the sun retiring to rest on the mountain-tops; 
                and<br>
                again they breathe their song of the traveller whom the whirlwind<br>
                could deprive of his cloak but not of his life. There is a rosy 
                tint<br>
                on the mountain snow, and there are rosy gleams in each heart 
                in which dwells the thought, &quot;God permits nothing to happen, 
                which is not the best for us.&quot; But this is not often revealed 
                to all, as it was<br>
                revealed to Babette in her wonderful dream.</p>

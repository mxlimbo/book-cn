              <p class="h" align="center"> THE SHIRT-COLLAR</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THERE was once a fine gentleman who possessed among other things 
                a<br>
                boot-jack and a hair-brush; but he had also the finest shirt-collar 
                in<br>
                the world, and of this collar we are about to hear a story. The 
                collar<br>
                had become so old that he began to think about getting married; 
                and<br>
                one day he happened to find himself in the same washing-tub as 
                a<br>
                garter. &quot;Upon my word,&quot; said the shirt-collar, &quot;I 
                have never seen<br>
                anything so slim and delicate, so neat and soft before. May I<br>
                venture to ask your name?&quot;<br>
                &quot;I shall not tell you,&quot; replied the garter.<br>
                &quot;Where do you reside when you are at home?&quot; asked the<br>
                shirt-collar. But the garter was naturally shy, and did not know 
                how<br>
                to answer such a question.<br>
                &quot;I presume you are a girdle,&quot; said the shirt-collar, 
                &quot;a sort of<br>
                under girdle. I see that you are useful, as well as ornamental, 
                my<br>
                little lady.&quot;<br>
                &quot;You must not speak to me,&quot; said the garter; &quot;I 
                do not think I<br>
                have given you any encouragement to do so.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Oh, when any one is as beautiful as you are,&quot; said 
                the<br>
                shirt-collar, &quot;is not that encouragement enough?&quot;<br>
                &quot;Get away; don't come so near me,&quot; said the garter, 
                &quot;you appear to<br>
                me quite like a man.&quot;<br>
                &quot;I am a fine gentleman certainly,&quot; said the shirt-collar, 
                &quot;I<br>
                possess a boot-jack and a hair-brush.&quot; This was not true, 
                for these<br>
                things belonged to his master; but he was a boaster.<br>
                &quot;Don't come so near me,&quot; said the garter; &quot;I am 
                not accustomed<br>
                to it.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Affectation!&quot; said the shirt-collar.<br>
                Then they were taken out of the wash-tub, starched, and hung<br>
                over a chair in the sunshine, and then laid on the ironing-board.<br>
                And now came the glowing iron. &quot;Mistress widow,&quot; said 
                the<br>
                shirt-collar, &quot;little mistress widow, I feel quite warm. 
                I am<br>
                changing, I am losing all my creases. You are burning a hole in 
                me.<br>
                Ugh! I propose to you.&quot;<br>
                &quot;You old rag,&quot; said the flat-iron, driving proudly over 
                the<br>
                collar, for she fancied herself a steam-engine, which rolls over 
                the<br>
                railway and draws carriages. &quot;You old rag!&quot; said she.<br>
                The edges of the shirt-collar were a little frayed, so the<br>
                scissors were brought to cut them smooth. &quot;Oh!&quot; exclaimed 
                the<br>
                shirt-collar, &quot;what a first-rate dancer you would make; you 
                can<br>
                stretch out your leg so well. I never saw anything so charming; 
                I am<br>
                sure no human being could do the same.&quot;<br>
                &quot;I should think not,&quot; replied the scissors.<br>
                &quot;You ought to be a countess,&quot; said the shirt collar; 
                &quot;but all I<br>
                possess consists of a fine gentleman, a boot-jack, and a comb. 
                I<br>
                wish I had an estate for your sake.&quot;<br>
                &quot;What! is he going to propose to me?&quot; said the scissors, 
                and she<br>
                became so angry that she cut too sharply into the shirt collar, 
                and it<br>
                was obliged to be thrown by as useless.<br>
                &quot;I shall be obliged to propose to the hair-brush,&quot; thought 
                the<br>
                shirt collar; so he remarked one day, &quot;It is wonderful what<br>
                beautiful hair you have, my little lady. Have you never thought 
                of<br>
                being engaged?&quot;<br>
                &quot;You might know I should think of it,&quot; answered the 
                hair brush; &quot;I<br>
                am engaged to the boot-jack.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Engaged!&quot; cried the shirt collar, &quot;now there is 
                no one left to<br>
                propose to;&quot; and then he pretended to despise all love-making.<br>
                A long time passed, and the shirt collar was taken in a bag to 
                the<br>
                paper-mill. Here was a large company of rags, the fine ones lying 
                by<br>
                themselves, separated from the coarser, as it ought to be. They 
                had<br>
                all many things to relate, especially the shirt collar, who was 
                a<br>
                terrible boaster. &quot;I have had an immense number of love affairs,&quot; 
                said<br>
                the shirt collar, &quot;no one left me any peace. It is true I 
                was a very<br>
                fine gentleman; quite stuck up. I had a boot-jack and a brush 
                that I<br>
                never used. You should have seen me then, when I was turned down. 
                I<br>
                shall never forget my first love; she was a girdle, so charming, 
                and<br>
                fine, and soft, and she threw herself into a washing tub for my<br>
                sake. There was a widow too, who was warmly in love with me, but 
                I<br>
                left her alone, and she became quite black. The next was a<br>
                first-rate dancer; she gave me the wound from which I still suffer,<br>
                she was so passionate. Even my own hair-brush was in love with 
                me, and<br>
                lost all her hair through neglected love. Yes, I have had great<br>
                experience of this kind, but my greatest grief was for the garter- 
                the<br>
                girdle I meant to say- that jumped into the wash-tub. I have a 
                great<br>
                deal on my conscience, and it is really time I should be turned 
                into<br>
                white paper.&quot;<br>
                And the shirt collar came to this at last. All the rags were<br>
                made into white paper, and the shirt collar became the very<br>
                identical piece of paper which we now see, and on which this story<br>
                is printed. It happened as a punishment to him, for having boasted<br>
                so shockingly of things which were not true. And this is a warning<br>
                to us, to be careful how we act, for we may some day find ourselves 
                in<br>
                the rag-bag, to be turned into white paper, on which our whole 
                history<br>
                may be written, even its most secret actions. And it would not 
                be<br>
                pleasant to have to run about the world in the form of a piece 
                of<br>
                paper, telling everything we have done, like the boasting shirt<br>
                collar.</p>
              <p><br>

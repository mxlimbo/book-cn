              <p class="h" align="center"> IN THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF THE SEA</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> SOME years ago, large ships were sent towards the north pole, 
                to<br>
                explore the distant coasts, and to try how far men could penetrate<br>
                into those unknown regions. For more than a year one of these 
                ships<br>
                had been pushing its way northward, amid snow and ice, and the 
                sailors had endured many hardships; till at length winter set 
                in, and the<br>
                sun entirely disappeared; for many weeks there would be constant<br>
                night. All around, as far as the eye could reach, nothing could 
                be<br>
                seen but fields of ice, in which the ship remained stuck fast. 
                The<br>
                snow lay piled up in great heaps, and of these the sailors made<br>
                huts, in the form of bee-hives, some of them as large and spacious<br>
                as one of the &quot;Huns' graves,&quot; and others only containing 
                room enough to hold three or four men. It was not quite dark; 
                the northern<br>
                lights shot forth red and blue flames, like continuous fireworks,<br>
                and the snow glittered, and reflected back the light, so that 
                the<br>
                night here was one long twilight. When the moon was brightest, 
                the<br>
                natives came in crowds to see the sailors. They had a very singular<br>
                appearance in their rough, hairy dresses of fur, and riding in 
                sledges<br>
                over the ice. They brought with them furs and skins in great<br>
                abundance, so that the snow-houses were soon provided with warm<br>
                carpets, and the furs also served for the sailors to wrap themselves<br>
                in, when they slept under the roofs of snow, while outside it 
                was<br>
                freezing with a cold far more severe than in the winter with us. 
                In<br>
                our country it was still autumn, though late in the season; and 
                they<br>
                thought of that in their distant exile, and often pictured to<br>
                themselves the yellow leaves on the trees at home. Their watches<br>
                pointed to the hours of evening, and time to go to sleep, although<br>
                in these regions it was now always night.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In one of the huts, two of the men laid themselves down to rest.<br>
                The younger of these men had brought with him from home his best,<br>
                his dearest treasure- a Bible, which his grandmother had given 
                him<br>
                on his departure. Every night the sacred volume rested under his 
                head, and he had known from his childhood what was written in 
                it. Every day he read in the book, and while stretched on his 
                cold couch, the holy words he had learnt would come into his mind: 
                &quot;If I take the<br>
                wings of the morning, and fly to the uttermost parts of the sea,<br>
                even there Thou art with me, and Thy right hand shall uphold me;&quot;<br>
                and under the influence of that faith which these holy words inspired,<br>
                sleep came upon him, and dreams, which are the manifestations 
                of God to the spirit. The soul lives and acts, while the body 
                is at rest.<br>
                He felt this life in him, and it was as if he heard the sound 
                of dear,<br>
                well-known melodies, as if the breezes of summer floated around 
                him;<br>
                and over his couch shone a ray of brightness, as if it were shining<br>
                through the covering of his snow-roof. He lifted his head, and 
                saw<br>
                that the bright gleaming was not the reflection of the glittering<br>
                snow, but the dazzling brightness of the pinions of a mighty angel,<br>
                into whose beaming face he was gazing. As from the cup of a lily,<br>
                the angel rose from amidst the leaves of the Bible; and, stretching<br>
                out his arm, the walls of the hut sunk down, as though they had 
                been<br>
                formed of a light, airy veil of mist, and the green hills and<br>
                meadows of home, with its ruddy woods, lay spread around him in 
                the quiet sunshine of a lovely autumn day. The nest of the stork 
                was<br>
                empty, but ripe fruit still hung on the wild apple-tree, although<br>
                the leaves had fallen. The red hips gleamed on the hedges, and 
                the<br>
                starling which hung in the green cage outside the window of the<br>
                peasant's hut, which was his home, whistled the tune which he 
                had<br>
                taught him. His grandmother hung green birds'-food around the 
                cage, as he, her grandson, had been accustomed to do. The daughter 
                of the<br>
                village blacksmith, who was young and fair, stood at the well, 
                drawing<br>
                water. She nodded to the grandmother, and the old woman nodded 
                to her, and pointed to a letter which had come from a long way 
                off. That<br>
                very morning the letter had arrived from the cold regions of the<br>
                north; there, where the absent one was sweetly sleeping under 
                the<br>
                protecting hand of God. They laughed and wept over the letter; 
                and he, far away, amid ice and snow, under the shadow of the angel's 
                wings, wept and smiled with them in spirit; for he saw and heard 
                it all in his dream. From the letter they read aloud the words 
                of Holy Writ: &quot;In the uttermost parts of the sea, Thy right 
                hand shall uphold me.&quot; </p>
              <p>And as the angel spread his wings like a veil over the sleeper, 
                there<br>
                was the sound of beautiful music and a hymn. Then the vision fled.<br>
                It was dark again in the snow-hut: but the Bible still rested<br>
                beneath his head, and faith and hope dwelt in his heart. God was<br>
                with him, and he carried home in his heart, even &quot;in the 
                uttermost<br>
                parts of the sea.</p>

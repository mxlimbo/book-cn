              <p class="h" align="center"> THE PSYCHE</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IN the fresh morning dawn, in the rosy air gleams a great Star,<br>
                the brightest Star of the morning. His rays tremble on the white 
                wall,<br>
                as if he wished to write down on it what he can tell, what he 
                has seen<br>
                there and elsewhere during thousands of years in our rolling world.<br>
                Let us hear one of his stories.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;A short time ago&quot;- the Star's &quot;short time ago&quot; 
                is called among<br>
                men &quot;centuries ago&quot;- &quot;my rays followed a young 
                artist. It was in the<br>
                city of the Popes, in the world-city, Rome. Much has been changed<br>
                there in the course of time, but the changes have not come so<br>
                quickly as the change from youth to old age. Then already the 
                palace<br>
                of the Caesars was a ruin, as it is now; fig trees and laurels 
                grew<br>
                among the fallen marble columns, and in the desolate bathing-halls,<br>
                where the gilding still clings to the wall; the Coliseum was a<br>
                gigantic ruin; the church bells sounded, the incense sent up its<br>
                fragrant cloud, and through the streets marched processions with<br>
                flaming tapers and glowing canopies. Holy Church was there, and 
                art<br>
                was held as a high and holy thing. In Rome lived the greatest<br>
                painter in the world, Raphael; there also dwelt the first of<br>
                sculptors, Michael Angelo. Even the Pope paid homage to these 
                two, and honored them with a visit. Art was recognized and honored, 
                and was rewarded also. But, for all that, everything great and 
                splendid was<br>
                not seen and known.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;In a narrow lane stood an old house. Once it had been a 
                temple; a<br>
                young sculptor now dwelt there. He was young and quite unknown. 
              </p>
              <p>He certainly had friends, young artists, like himself, young 
                in spirit,<br>
                young in hopes and thoughts; they told him he was rich in talent,<br>
                and an artist, but that he was foolish for having no faith in 
                his<br>
                own power; for he always broke what he had fashioned out of clay,<br>
                and never completed anything; and a work must be completed if 
                it is to be seen and to bring money.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'You are a dreamer,' they went on to say to him, 'and that's 
                your<br>
                misfortune. But the reason of this is, that you have never lived,<br>
                you have never tasted life, you have never enjoyed it in great<br>
                wholesome draughts, as it ought to be enjoyed. In youth one must<br>
                mingle one's own personality with life, that they may become one. 
                Look at the great master Raphael, whom the Pope honors and the 
                world admires. He's no despiser of wine and bread.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'And he even appreciates the baker's daughter, the pretty<br>
                Fornarina,' added Angelo, one of the merriest of the young friends.<br>
                &quot;Yes, they said a good many things of the kind, according 
                to their<br>
                age and their reason. They wanted to draw the young artist out 
                with<br>
                them into the merry wild life, the mad life as it might also be<br>
                called; and at certain times he felt an inclination for it. He 
                had<br>
                warm blood, a strong imagination, and could take part in the merry<br>
                chat, and laugh aloud with the rest; but what they called 'Raphael's<br>
                merry life' disappeared before him like a vapor when he saw the 
                divine radiance that beamed forth from the pictures of the great 
                master; and when he stood in the Vatican, before the forms of 
                beauty which the masters had hewn out of marble thousands of years 
                since, his breast swelled, and he felt within himself something 
                high, something holy, something elevating, great and good, and 
                he wished that he could produce similar forms from the blocks 
                of marble. He wished to make a picture of that which was within 
                him, stirring upward from his heart to the realms of the Infinite; 
                but how, and in what form? The soft clay was fashioned under his 
                fingers into forms of beauty, but the next day he broke what he 
                had fashioned, according to his wont.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;One day he walked past one of those rich palaces of which 
                Rome<br>
                has many to show. He stopped before the great open portal, and<br>
                beheld a garden surrounded by cloistered walks. The garden bloomed<br>
                with a goodly show of the fairest roses. Great white lilies with 
                green<br>
                juicy leaves shot upward from the marble basin in which the clear<br>
                water was splashing; and a form glided past, the daughter of the<br>
                princely house, graceful, delicate, and wonderfully fair. Such 
                a<br>
                form of female loveliness he had never before beheld- yet stay: 
                he had<br>
                seen it, painted by Raphael, painted as a Psyche, in one of the<br>
                Roman palaces. Yes, there it had been painted; but here it passed 
                by<br>
                him in living reality.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The remembrance lived in his thoughts, in his heart. He 
                went home<br>
                to his humble room, and modelled a Psyche of clay. It was the 
                rich<br>
                young Roman girl, the noble maiden; and for the first time he 
                looked<br>
                at his work with satisfaction. It had a meaning for him, for it 
                was<br>
                she. And the friends who saw his work shouted aloud for joy; they<br>
                declared that this work was a manifestation of his artistic power,<br>
                of which they had long been aware, and that now the world should 
                be<br>
                made aware of it too.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The clay figure was lifelike and beautiful, but it had 
                not the<br>
                whiteness or the durability of marble. So they declared that the<br>
                Psyche must henceforth live in marble. He already possessed a 
                costly<br>
                block of that stone. It had been lying for years, the property 
                of<br>
                his parents, in the courtyard. Fragments of glass, climbing weeds, 
                and<br>
                remains of artichokes had gathered about it and sullied its purity;<br>
                but under the surface the block was as white as the mountain snow; 
                and from this block the Psyche was to arise.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now, it happened one morning- the bright Star tells nothing<br>
                about this, but we know it occurred- that a noble Roman company 
                came into the narrow lane. The carriage stopped at the top of 
                the lane, and the company proceeded on foot towards the house, 
                to inspect the young sculptor's work, for they had heard him spoken 
                of by chance. And who were these distinguished guests? Poor young 
                man! or fortunate young man he might be called. The noble young 
                lady stood in the room and smiled radiantly when her father said 
                to her, &quot;It is your living image.&quot; That smile could 
                not be copied, any more than the look could be reproduced, the 
                wonderful look which she cast upon the young artist. It was a 
                fiery look, that seemed at once to elevate and to crush him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The Psyche must be executed in marble,&quot; said the wealthy<br>
                patrician. And those were words of life for the dead clay and 
                the<br>
                heavy block of marble, and words of life likewise for the deeply-moved 
                artist. &quot;When the work is finished I will purchase it,&quot; 
                continued the rich noble.<br>
              </p>
              <p>A new era seemed to have arisen in the poor studio. Life and<br>
                cheerfulness gleamed there, and busy industry plied its work. 
                The<br>
                beaming Morning Star beheld how the work progressed. The clay 
                itself seemed inspired since she had been there, and moulded itself, 
                in<br>
                heightened beauty, to a likeness of the well-known features.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now I know what life is,&quot; cried the artist rejoicingly; 
                &quot;it is<br>
                Love! It is the lofty abandonment of self for the dawning of the<br>
                beautiful in the soul! What my friends call life and enjoyment 
                is a<br>
                passing shadow; it is like bubbles among seething dregs, not the<br>
                pure heavenly wine that consecrates us to life.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The marble block was reared in its place. The chisel struck<br>
                great fragments from it; the measurements were taken, points and 
                lines were made, the mechanical part was executed, till gradually 
                the<br>
                stone assumed a human female form, a shape of beauty, and became<br>
                converted into the Psyche, fair and glorious- a divine being in<br>
                human shape. The heavy stone appeared as a gliding, dancing, airy<br>
                Psyche, with the heavenly innocent smile- the smile that had<br>
                mirrored itself in the soul of the young artist.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Star of the roseate dawn beheld and understood what was<br>
                stirring within the young man, and could read the meaning of the<br>
                changing color of his cheek, of the light that flashed from his 
                eye,<br>
                as he stood busily working, reproducing what had been put into 
                his<br>
                soul from above.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thou art a master like those masters among the ancient 
                Greeks,&quot;<br>
                exclaimed his delighted friends; &quot;soon shall the whole world 
                admire<br>
                thy Psyche.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;My Psyche!&quot; he repeated. &quot;Yes, mine. She must 
                be mine. I, too, am<br>
                an artist, like those great men who are gone. Providence has granted<br>
                me the boon, and has made me the equal of that lady of noble birth.&quot;<br>
                And he knelt down and breathed a prayer of thankfulnesss to<br>
                Heaven, and then he forgot Heaven for her sake- for the sake of 
                her<br>
                picture in stone- for her Psyche which stood there as if formed 
                of<br>
                snow, blushing in the morning dawn.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He was to see her in reality, the living, graceful Psyche, whose<br>
                words sounded like music in his ears. He could now carry the news 
                into the rich palace that the marble Psyche was finished. He betook 
                himself thither, strode through the open courtyard where the waters 
                ran splashing from the dolphin's jaws into the marble basins, 
                where the snowy lilies and the fresh roses bloomed in abundance. 
                He stepped into the great lofty hall, whose walls and ceilings 
                shone with gilding and bright colors and heraldic devices. Gayly-dressed 
                serving-men, adorned with trappings like sleigh horses, walked 
                to and fro, and some reclined at their ease upon the carved oak 
                seats, as if they were the masters of the house. He told them 
                what had brought him to the palace, and was conducted up the shining 
                marble staircase, covered with soft carpets and adorned with many 
                a statue. Then he went on through richly-furnished chambers, over 
                mosaic floors, amid gorgeous pictures. All this pomp and luxury 
                seemed to weary him; but soon he felt relieved, for the princely 
                old master of the house received him most graciously,, almost 
                heartily; and when he took his leave he was requested to step 
                into the Signora's apartment, for she, too, wished to see him. 
                The servants led him through more luxurious halls and chambers 
                into her room, where she appeared the chief and leading ornament.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She spoke to him. No hymn of supplication, no holy chant, could<br>
                melt his soul like the sound of her voice. He took her hand and 
                lifted<br>
                it to his lips. No rose was softer, but a fire thrilled through 
                him<br>
                from this rose- a feeling of power came upon him, and words poured<br>
                from his tongue- he knew not what he said. Does the crater of 
                the<br>
                volcano know that the glowing lava is pouring from it? He confessed<br>
                what he felt for her. She stood before him astonished, offended,<br>
                proud, with contempt in her face, an expression of disgust, as 
                if<br>
                she had suddenly touched a cold unclean reptile. Her cheeks<br>
                reddened, her lips grew white, and her eyes flashed fire, though<br>
                they were dark as the blackness of night.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Madman!&quot; she cried, &quot;away! begone!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And she turned her back upon him. Her beautiful face wore an<br>
                expression like that of the stony countenance with the snaky locks.<br>
                Like a stricken, fainting man, he tottered down the staircase<br>
                and out into the street. Like a man walking in his sleep, he found 
                his<br>
                way back to his dwelling. Then he woke up to madness and agony, 
                and seized his hammer, swung it high in the air, and rushed forward 
                to<br>
                shatter the beautiful marble image. But, in his pain, he had not<br>
                noticed that his friend Angelo stood beside him; and Angelo held<br>
                back his arm with a strong grasp, crying,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Are you mad? What are you about?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>They struggled together. Angelo was the stronger; and, with a 
                deep<br>
                sigh of exhaustion, the young artist threw himself into a chair.<br>
                &quot;What has happened?&quot; asked Angelo. &quot;Command yourself. 
                Speak!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But what could he say? How could he explain? And as Angelo could<br>
                make no sense of his friend's incoherent words, he forbore to 
                question him further, and merely said,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Your blood grows thick from your eternal dreaming. Be a 
                man, as<br>
                all others are, and don't go on living in ideals, for that is 
                what<br>
                drives men crazy. A jovial feast will make you sleep quietly and<br>
                happily. Believe me, the time will come when you will be old, 
                and your sinews will shrink, and then, on some fine sunshiny day, 
                when<br>
                everything is laughing and rejoicing, you will lie there a faded<br>
                plant, that will grow no more. I do not live in dreams, but in<br>
                reality. Come with me. Be a man!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And he drew the artist away with him. At this moment he was able<br>
                to do so, for a fire ran in the blood of the young sculptor; a<br>
                change had taken place in his soul; he felt a longing to tear 
                from the<br>
                old, the accustomed- to forget, if possible, his own individuality;<br>
                and therefore it was that he followed Angelo.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In an out-of-the-way suburb of Rome lay a tavern much visited 
                by<br>
                artists. It was built on the ruins of some ancient baths. The 
                great<br>
                yellow citrons hung down among the dark shining leaves, and covered 
                a part of the old reddish-yellow walls. The tavern consisted of 
                a vaulted chamber, almost like a cavern, in the ruins. A lamp 
                burned there before the picture of the Madonna. A great fire gleamed 
                on the hearth, and roasting and boiling was going on there; without, 
                under the citron trees and laurels, stood a few covered tables.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The two artists were received by their friends with shouts of<br>
                welcome. Little was eaten, but much was drunk, and the spirits 
                of<br>
                the company rose. Songs were sung and ditties were played on the<br>
                guitar; presently the Salterello sounded, and the merry dance 
                began.<br>
                Two young Roman girls, who sat as models to the artists, took 
                part<br>
                in the dance and in the festivity. Two charming Bacchantes were<br>
                they; certainly not Psyches- not delicate, beautiful roses, but 
                fresh,<br>
                hearty, glowing carnations.<br>
              </p>
              <p>How hot it was on that day! Even after sundown it was hot. There<br>
                was fire in the blood, fire in every glance, fire everywhere. 
                The<br>
                air gleamed with gold and roses, and life seemed like gold and 
                roses.<br>
                &quot;At last you have joined us, for once,&quot; said his friends. 
                &quot;Now let<br>
                yourself be carried by the waves within and around you.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Never yet have I felt so well, so merry!&quot; cried the 
                young artist.<br>
                &quot;You are right- you are all of you right. I was a fool- a 
                dreamer. Man<br>
                belongs to reality, and not to fancy.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>With songs and with sounding guitars the young people returned<br>
                that evening from the tavern, through the narrow streets; the 
                two<br>
                glowing carnations, daughters of the Campagna, went with them.<br>
                In Angelo's room, among a litter of colored sketches (studies) 
                and<br>
                glowing pictures, the voices sounded mellower, but not less merrily.<br>
                On the ground lay many a sketch that resembled the daughters of 
                the<br>
                Campagna, in their fresh, hearty comeliness, but the two originals<br>
                were far handsomer than their portraits. All the burners of the<br>
                six-armed lamp flared and flamed; and the human flamed up from 
                within, and appeared in the glare as if it were divine.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Apollo! Jupiter! I feel myself raised to our heaven- to 
                your<br>
                glory! I feel as if the blossom of life were unfolding itself 
                in my<br>
                veins at this moment!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Yes, the blossom unfolded itself, and then burst and fell, and<br>
                an evil vapor arose from it, blinding the sight, leading astray 
                the<br>
                fancy; the firework of the senses went out, and it became dark.<br>
                He was again in his own room. There he sat down on his bed and<br>
                collected his thoughts.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Fie on thee!&quot; these were the words that sounded out 
                of his<br>
                mouth from the depths of his heart. &quot;Wretched man, go, begone!&quot; 
                And a deep painful sigh burst from his bosom.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Away! begone!&quot; These, her words, the words of the 
                living<br>
                Psyche, echoed through his heart, escaped from his lips. He buried 
                his head in the pillows, his thoughts grew confused, and he fell 
                asleep.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the morning dawn he started up, and collected his thoughts<br>
                anew. What had happened? Had all the past been a dream? The visit 
                to her, the feast at the tavern, the evening with the purple carnations<br>
                of the Campagna? No, it was all real- a reality he had never before<br>
                experienced.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the purple air gleamed the bright Star, and its beams fell 
                upon<br>
                him and upon the marble Psyche. He trembled as he looked at that<br>
                picture of immortality, and his glance seemed impure to him. He<br>
                threw the cloth over the statue, and then touched it once more 
                to<br>
                unveil the form- but he was not able to look again at his own 
                work.<br>
                Gloomy, quiet, absorbed in his own thoughts, he sat there<br>
                through the long day; he heard nothing of what was going on around<br>
                him, and no man guessed what was passing in this human soul.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And days and weeks went by, but the nights passed more slowly 
                than<br>
                the days. The flashing Star beheld him one morning as he rose, 
                pale<br>
                and trembling with fever, from his sad couch; then he stepped<br>
                towards the statue, threw back the covering, took one long,<br>
                sorrowful gaze at his work, and then, almost sinking beneath the<br>
                burden, he dragged the statue out into the garden. In that place 
                was<br>
                an old dry well, now nothing but a hole. Into this he cast the 
                Psyche,<br>
                threw earth in above her, and covered up the spot with twigs and<br>
                nettles.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Away! begone!&quot; Such was the short epitaph he spoke.<br>
                The Star beheld all this from the pink morning sky, and its beam<br>
                trembled upon two great tears upon the pale feverish cheeks of 
                the<br>
                young man; and soon it was said that he was sick unto death, and 
                he<br>
                lay stretched upon a bed of pain.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The convent Brother Ignatius visited him as a physician and a<br>
                friend, and brought him words of comfort, of religion, and spoke 
                to<br>
                him of the peace and happiness of the church, of the sinfulness 
                of<br>
                man, of rest and mercy to be found in heaven.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the words fell like warm sunbeams upon a teeming soil. The<br>
                soil smoked and sent up clouds of mist, fantastic pictures, pictures<br>
                in which there was reality; and from these floating islands he<br>
                looked across at human life. He found it vanity and delusion- 
                and<br>
                vanity and delusion it had been to him. They told him that art 
                was a<br>
                sorcerer, betraying us to vanity and to earthly lusts; that we 
                are<br>
                false to ourselves, unfaithful to our friends, unfaithful towards<br>
                Heaven; and that the serpent was always repeating within us, &quot;Eat, 
                and thou shalt become as God.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And it appeared to him as if now, for the first time, he knew<br>
                himself, and had found the way that leads to truth and to peace. 
                In<br>
                the church was the light and the brightness of God- in the monk's 
                cell<br>
                he should find the rest through which the tree of human life might<br>
                grow on into eternity.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Brother Ignatius strengthened his longings, and the<br>
                determination became firm within him. A child of the world became 
                a<br>
                servant of the church- the young artist renounced the world, and<br>
                retired into the cloister.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The brothers came forward affectionately to welcome him, and 
                his<br>
                inauguration was as a Sunday feast. Heaven seemed to him to dwell 
                in<br>
                the sunshine of the church, and to beam upon him from the holy<br>
                pictures and from the cross. And when, in the evening, at the 
                sunset<br>
                hour, he stood in his little cell, and, opening the window, looked 
                out<br>
                upon old Rome, upon the desolated temples, and the great dead<br>
                Coliseum- when he saw all this in its spring garb, when the acacias<br>
                bloomed, and the ivy was fresh, and roses burst forth everywhere,<br>
                and the citron and orange were in the height of their beauty, 
                and<br>
                the palm trees waved their branches- then he felt a deeper emotion<br>
                than had ever yet thrilled through him. The quiet open Campagna 
                spread itself forth towards the blue snow-covered mountains, which 
                seemed to be painted in the air; all the outlines melting into 
                each other,<br>
                breathing peace and beauty, floating, dreaming- and all appearing 
                like<br>
                a dream!<br>
              </p>
              <p>Yes, this world was a dream, and the dream lasts for hours, and<br>
                may return for hours; but convent life is a life of years- long 
                years,<br>
                and many years.<br>
              </p>
              <p>From within comes much that renders men sinful and impure. He<br>
                fully realized the truth of this. What flames arose up in him 
                at<br>
                times! What a source of evil, of that which we would not, welled 
                up<br>
                continually! He mortified his body, but the evil came from within.</p>
              <p> One day, after the lapse of many years, he met Angelo, who<br>
                recognized him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Man!&quot; exclaimed Angelo. &quot;Yes, it is thou! Art 
                thou happy now?<br>
                Thou hast sinned against God, and cast away His boon from thee- 
                hast neglected thy mission in this world! Read the parable of 
                the intrusted talent! The MASTER, who spoke that parable, spoke 
                the truth! What hast thou gained? What hast thou found? Dost thou 
                not fashion for thyself a religion and a dreamy life after thine 
                own idea, as almost all do?<br>
              </p>
              <p>Suppose all this is a dream, a fair delusion!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Get thee away from me, Satan!&quot; said the monk; and 
                he quitted<br>
                Angelo.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There is a devil, a personal devil! This day I have seen 
                him!&quot;<br>
                said the monk to himself. &quot;Once I extended a finger to him, 
                and he<br>
                took my whole hand. But now,&quot; he sighed, &quot;the evil is 
                within me, and<br>
                it is in yonder man; but it does not bow him down; he goes abroad 
                with head erect, and enjoys his comfort; and I grasped at comfort 
                in the consolations of religion. If it were nothing but a consolation?<br>
                Supposing everything here were, like the world I have quitted, 
                only<br>
                a beautiful fancy, a delusion like the beauty of the evening clouds,<br>
                like the misty blue of the distant hills!- when you approach them,<br>
                they are very different! O eternity! Thou actest like the great 
                calm<br>
                ocean, that beckons us, and fills us with expectation- and when 
                we<br>
                embark upon thee, we sink, disappear, and cease to be. Delusion!<br>
                away with it! begone!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And tearless, but sunk in bitter reflection, he sat upon his<br>
                hard couch, and then knelt down- before whom? Before the stone 
                cross fastened to the wall? No, it was only habit that made him 
                take this position.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The more deeply he looked into his own heart, the blacker did<br>
                the darkness seem. -&quot;Nothing within, nothing without- this 
                life<br>
                squanderied and cast away!&quot; And this thought rolled and grew 
                like a<br>
                snowball, until it seemed to crush him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I can confide my griefs to none. I may speak to none of 
                the<br>
                gnawing worm within. My secret is my prisoner; if I let the captive<br>
                escape, I shall be his!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the godlike power that dwelt within him suffered and strove.<br>
                &quot;O Lord, my Lord!&quot; he cried, in his despair, &quot;be 
                merciful and<br>
                grant me faith. I threw away the gift thou hadst vouchsafed to 
                me, I<br>
                left my mission unfulfilled. I lacked strength, and strength thou<br>
                didst not give me. Immortality- the Psyche in my breast- away 
                with<br>
                it!- it shall be buried like that Psyche, the best gleam of my 
                life;<br>
                never will it arise out of its grave!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Star glowed in the roseate air, the Star that shall surely<br>
                be extinguished and pass away while the soul still lives on; its<br>
                trembling beam fell upon the white wall, but it wrote nothing 
                there<br>
                upon being made perfect in God, nothing of the hope of mercy, 
                of the reliance on the divine love that thrills through the heart 
                of the<br>
                believer.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The Psyche within can never die. Shall it live in consciousness? 
                Can the incomprehensible happen? Yes, yes. My being is incomprehensible. 
                Thou art unfathomable, O Lord. Thy whole world is incomprehensible- 
                a wonder-work of power, of glory and of love.&quot;<br>
                His eyes gleamed, and then closed in death. The tolling of the<br>
                church bell was the last sound that echoed above him, above the 
                dead<br>
                man; and they buried him, covering him with earth that had been<br>
                brought from Jerusalem, and in which was mingled the dust of many 
                of the pious dead.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When years had gone by his skeleton was dug up, as the skeletons<br>
                of the monks who had died before him had been; it was clad in 
                a<br>
                brown frock, a rosary was put into the bony hand, and the form 
                was<br>
                placed among the ranks of other skeletons in the cloisters of 
                the<br>
                convent. And the sun shone without, while within the censers were<br>
                waved and the Mass was celebrated.</p>
              <p> And years rolled by.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The bones fell asunder and became mingled with others. Skulls 
                were<br>
                piled up till they formed an outer wall around the church; and 
                there<br>
                lay also his head in the burning sun, for many dead were there, 
                and no<br>
                one knew their names, and his name was forgotten also. And see,<br>
                something was moving in the sunshine, in the sightless cavernous 
                eyes!<br>
              </p>
              <p>What might that be? A sparkling lizard moved about in the skull,<br>
                gliding in and out through the sightless holes. The lizard now<br>
                represented all the life left in that head, in which once great<br>
                thoughts, bright dreams, the love of art and of the glorious, 
                had<br>
                arisen, whence hot tears had rolled down, where hope and immortality<br>
                had had their being. The lizard sprang away and disappeared, and 
                the<br>
                skull itself crumbled to pieces and became dust among dust.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Centuries passed away. The bright Star gleamed unaltered,<br>
                radiant and large, as it had gleamed for thousands of years, and 
                the<br>
                air glowed red with tints fresh as roses, crimson like blood.<br>
                There, where once had stood the narrow lane containing the ruins<br>
                of the temple, a nunnery was now built. A grave was being dug 
                in the<br>
                convent garden for a young nun who had died, and was to be laid 
                in the earth this morning. The spade struck against a hard substance; 
                it<br>
                was a stone, that shone dazzling white. A block of marble soon<br>
                appeared, a rounded shoulder was laid bare; and now the spade 
                was<br>
                plied with a more careful hand, and presently a female head was<br>
                seen, and butterflies' wings. Out of the grave in which the young<br>
                nun was to be laid they lifted, in the rosy morning, a wonderful<br>
                statue of a Psyche carved in white marble.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How beautiful, how perfect it is!&quot; cried the spectators. 
                &quot;A relic<br>
                of the best period of art.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And who could the sculptor have been? No one knew; no one<br>
                remembered him, except the bright star that had gleamed for<br>
                thousands of years. The star had seen the course of that life 
                on<br>
                earth, and knew of the man's trials, of his weakness- in fact, 
                that he<br>
                had been but human. The man's life had passed away, his dust had<br>
                been scattered abroad as dust is destined to be; but the result 
                of his<br>
                noblest striving, the glorious work that gave token of the divine<br>
                element within him- the Psyche that never dies, that lives beyond<br>
                posterity- the brightness even of this earthly Psyche remained 
                here<br>
                after him, and was seen and acknowledged and appreciated.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The bright Morning Star in the roseate air threw its glancing<br>
                ray downward upon the Psyche, and upon the radiant countenances 
                of the admiring spectators, who here beheld the image of the soul 
                portrayed in marble.<br>
              </p>
              <p>What is earthly will pass away and be forgotten, and the Star 
                in<br>
                the vast firmament knows it. What is heavenly will shine brightly<br>
                through posterity; and when the ages of posterity are past, the<br>
                Psyche- the soul- will still live on!</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> THE OLD STREET LAMP</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> DID you ever hear the story of the old street lamp? It is not<br>
                remarkably interesting, but for once in a way you may as well 
                listen<br>
                to it. It was a most respectable old lamp, which had seen many, 
                many<br>
                years of service, and now was to retire with a pension. It was 
                this<br>
                evening at its post for the last time, giving light to the street. 
                His<br>
                feelings were something like those of an old dancer at the theatre,<br>
                who is dancing for the last time, and knows that on the morrow 
                she<br>
                will be in her garret, alone and forgotten. The lamp had very 
                great<br>
                anxiety about the next day, for he knew that he had to appear 
                for<br>
                the first time at the town hall, to be inspected by the mayor 
                and<br>
                the council, who were to decide if he were fit for further service<br>
                or not;- whether the lamp was good enough to be used to light 
                the<br>
                inhabitants of one of the suburbs, or in the country, at some 
                factory;<br>
                and if not, it would be sent at once to an iron foundry, to be<br>
                melted down. In this latter case it might be turned into anything, 
                and<br>
                he wondered very much whether he would then be able to remember 
                that he had once been a street lamp, and it troubled him exceedingly.<br>
                Whatever might happen, one thing seemed certain, that he would 
                be<br>
                separated from the watchman and his wife, whose family he looked<br>
                upon as his own. The lamp had first been hung up on that very<br>
                evening that the watchman, then a robust young man, had entered 
                upon the duties of his office. Ah, well, it was a very long time 
                since<br>
                one became a lamp and the other a watchman. His wife had a little<br>
                pride in those days; she seldom condescended to glance at the 
                lamp,<br>
                excepting when she passed by in the evening, never in the daytime. 
              </p>
              <p>But in later years, when all these,- the watchman, the wife, 
                and the lamp- had grown old, she had attended to it, cleaned it, 
                and supplied it with oil. The old people were thoroughly honest, 
                they had never<br>
                cheated the lamp of a single drop of the oil provided for it.<br>
                This was the lamp's last night in the street, and to-morrow he<br>
                must go to the town-hall,- two very dark things to think of. No 
                wonder he did not burn brightly. Many other thoughts also passed 
                through his mind. How many persons he had lighted on their way, 
                and how much he had seen; as much, very likely, as the mayor and 
                corporation themselves! None of these thoughts were uttered aloud, 
                however; for he was a good, honorable old lamp, who would not 
                willingly do harm to any one, especially to those in authority. 
                As many things were recalled to his mind, the light would flash 
                up with sudden brightness; he had, at such moments, a conviction 
                that he would be remembered. &quot;There was a handsome young 
                man once,&quot; thought he; &quot;it is certainly a long while 
                ago, but I remember he had a little note, written on pink paper 
                with a gold edge; the writing was elegant, evidently a lady's 
                hand: twice he read it through, and kissed it, and then looked 
                up at me, with eyes that said quite plainly, 'I am the happiest 
                of men!'<br>
              </p>
              <p>Only he and I know what was written on this his first letter 
                from<br>
                his lady-love. Ah, yes, and there was another pair of eyes that 
                I<br>
                remember,- it is really wonderful how the thoughts jump from one 
                thing to another! A funeral passed through the street; a young 
                and beautiful woman lay on a bier, decked with garlands of flowers, 
                and attended by torches, which quite overpowered my light. All 
                along the street stood the people from the houses, in crowds, 
                ready to join the<br>
                procession. But when the torches had passed from before me, and 
                I<br>
                could look round, I saw one person alone, standing, leaning against 
                my post, and weeping. Never shall I forget the sorrowful eyes 
                that looked up at me.&quot; These and similar reflections occupied 
                the old street lamp, on this the last time that his light would 
                shine. The sentry, when he is relieved from his post, knows at 
                least who will succeed him, and may whisper a few words to him, 
                but the lamp did not know his successor, or he could have given 
                him a few hints respecting rain,<br>
                or mist, and could have informed him how far the moon's rays would<br>
                rest on the pavement, and from which side the wind generally blew, 
                and so on.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On the bridge over the canal stood three persons, who wished 
                to<br>
                recommend themselves to the lamp, for they thought he could give 
                the office to whomsoever he chose. The first was a herring's head, 
                which could emit light in the darkness. He remarked that it would 
                be a great saving of oil if they placed him on the lamp-post. 
                Number two was a piece of rotten wood, which also shines in the 
                dark. He considered himself descended from an old stem, once the 
                pride of the forest.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The third was a glow-worm, and how he found his way there the 
                lamp<br>
                could not imagine, yet there he was, and could really give light 
                as<br>
                well as the others. But the rotten wood and the herring's head<br>
                declared most solemnly, by all they held sacred, that the glow-worm<br>
                only gave light at certain times, and must not be allowed to compete<br>
                with themselves. The old lamp assured them that not one of them<br>
                could give sufficient light to fill the position of a street lamp; 
                but<br>
                they would believe nothing he said. And when they discovered that 
                he<br>
                had not the power of naming his successor, they said they were 
                very<br>
                glad to hear it, for the lamp was too old and worn-out to make 
                a<br>
                proper choice.<br>
              </p>
              <p>At this moment the wind came rushing round the corner of the<br>
                street, and through the air-holes of the old lamp. &quot;What 
                is this I<br>
                hear?&quot; said he; &quot;that you are going away to-morrow? 
                Is this evening<br>
                the last time we shall meet? Then I must present you with a farewell<br>
                gift. I will blow into your brain, so that in future you shall 
                not<br>
                only be able to remember all that you have seen or heard in the<br>
                past, but your light within shall be so bright, that you shall 
                be able<br>
                to understand all that is said or done in your presence.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, that is really a very, very great gift,&quot; said 
                the old lamp;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I thank you most heartily. I only hope I shall not be melted 
                down.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is not likely to happen yet,&quot; said the wind; 
                &quot;and I will<br>
                also blow a memory into you, so that should you receive other<br>
                similar presents your old age will pass very pleasantly.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is if I am not melted down,&quot; said the lamp. &quot;But 
                should I in<br>
                that case still retain my memory?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Do be reasonable, old lamp,&quot; said the wind, puffing 
                away.<br>
                At this moment the moon burst forth from the clouds. &quot;What 
                will<br>
                you give the old lamp?&quot; asked the wind.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I can give nothing,&quot; she replied; &quot;I am on the 
                wane, and no lamps<br>
                have ever given me light while I have frequently shone upon them.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>And with these words the moon hid herself again behind the clouds, 
                that she might be saved from further importunities. Just then 
                a drop fell upon the lamp, from the roof of the house, but the 
                drop explained that he was a gift from those gray clouds, and 
                perhaps the best of all<br>
                gifts. &quot;I shall penetrate you so thoroughly,&quot; he said, 
                &quot;that you<br>
                will have the power of becoming rusty, and, if you wish it, to 
                crumble<br>
                into dust in one night.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But this seemed to the lamp a very shabby present, and the wind<br>
                thought so too. &quot;Does no one give any more? Will no one give 
                any<br>
                more?&quot; shouted the breath of the wind, as loud as it could. 
                Then a<br>
                bright falling star came down, leaving a broad, luminous streak 
                behind<br>
                it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What was that?&quot; cried the herring's head. &quot;Did 
                not a star fall? I<br>
                really believe it went into the lamp. Certainly, when such high-born<br>
                personages try for the office, we may as well say 'Good-night,' 
                and go home.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And so they did, all three, while the old lamp threw a wonderfully<br>
                strong light all around him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This is a glorious gift,&quot; said he; &quot;the bright 
                stars have<br>
                always been a joy to me, and have always shone more brilliantly 
                than I<br>
                ever could shine, though I have tried with my whole might; and 
                now<br>
                they have noticed me, a poor old lamp, and have sent me a gift 
                that<br>
                will enable me to see clearly everything that I remember, as if 
                it<br>
                still stood before me, and to be seen by all those who love me. 
                And<br>
                herein lies the truest pleasure, for joy which we cannot share 
                with<br>
                others is only half enjoyed.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That sentiment does you honor,&quot; said the wind; &quot;but 
                for this<br>
                purpose wax lights will be necessary. If these are not lighted 
                in you,<br>
                your particular faculties will not benefit others in the least. 
                The<br>
                stars have not thought of this; they suppose that you and every<br>
                other light must be a wax taper: but I must go down now.&quot; 
                So he laid<br>
                himself to rest.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Wax tapers, indeed!&quot; said the lamp, &quot;I have never 
                yet had<br>
                these, nor is it likely I ever shall. If I could only be sure 
                of not<br>
                being melted down!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The next day. Well, perhaps we had better pass over the next<br>
                day. The evening had come, and the lamp was resting in a grandfather's 
                chair, and guess where! Why, at the old watchman's house. He had 
                begged, as a favor, that the mayor and corporation would allow 
                him to keep the street lamp, in consideration of his long and 
                faithful service, as he had himself hung it up and lit it on the 
                day he first commenced his duties, four-and-twenty years ago. 
                He looked upon it almost as his own child; he had no children, 
                so the lamp was given to him. There it lay in the great arm-chair 
                near to the warm stove. It seemed almost as if it had grown larger, 
                for it appeared quite to fill the chair. The old people sat at 
                their supper, casting friendly<br>
                glances at the old lamp, whom they would willingly have admitted 
                to<br>
                a place at the table. It is quite true that they dwelt in a cellar,<br>
                two yards deep in the earth, and they had to cross a stone passage<br>
                to get to their room, but within it was warm and comfortable and<br>
                strips of list had been nailed round the door. The bed and the<br>
                little window had curtains, and everything looked clean and neat. 
                On<br>
                the window seat stood two curious flower-pots which a sailor, 
                named<br>
                Christian, had brought over from the East or West Indies. They 
                were of clay, and in the form of two elephants, with open backs; 
                they were<br>
                hollow and filled with earth, and through the open space flowers<br>
                bloomed. In one grew some very fine chives or leeks; this was 
                the<br>
                kitchen garden. The other elephant, which contained a beautiful<br>
                geranium, they called their flower garden. On the wall hung a 
                large<br>
                colored print, representing the congress of Vienna, and all the<br>
                kings and emperors at once. A clock, with heavy weights, hung 
                on the wall and went &quot;tick, tick,&quot; steadily enough; 
                yet it was always<br>
                rather too fast, which, however, the old people said was better 
                than<br>
                being too slow. They were now eating their supper, while the old<br>
                street lamp, as we have heard, lay in the grandfather's arm-chair 
                near<br>
                the stove. It seemed to the lamp as if the whole world had turned<br>
                round; but after a while the old watchman looked at the lamp, 
                and<br>
                spoke of what they had both gone through together,- in rain and 
                in<br>
                fog; during the short bright nights of summer, or in the long 
                winter<br>
                nights, through the drifting snow-storms, when he longed to be 
                at home in the cellar. Then the lamp felt it was all right again. 
                He saw<br>
                everything that had happened quite clearly, as if it were passing<br>
                before him. Surely the wind had given him an excellent gift. The 
                old<br>
                people were very active and industrious, they were never idle 
                for even<br>
                a single hour. On Sunday afternoons they would bring out some 
                books, generally a book of travels which they were very fond of. 
                The old man would read aloud about Africa, with its great forests 
                and the wild elephants, while his wife would listen attentively, 
                stealing a<br>
                glance now and then at the clay elephants, which served as<br>
                flower-pots.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I can almost imagine I am seeing it all,&quot; she said; 
                and then<br>
                how the lamp wished for a wax taper to be lighted in him, for 
                then the<br>
                old woman would have seen the smallest detail as clearly as he 
                did<br>
                himself. The lofty trees, with their thickly entwined branches, 
                the<br>
                naked negroes on horseback, and whole herds of elephants treading 
                down bamboo thickets with their broad, heavy feet.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What is the use of all my capabilities,&quot; sighed the 
                old lamp,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;when I cannot obtain any wax lights; they have only oil 
                and tallow<br>
                here, and these will not do.&quot; One day a great heap of wax-candle<br>
                ends found their way into the cellar. The larger pieces were burnt,<br>
                and the smaller ones the old woman kept for waxing her thread. 
                So<br>
                there were now candles enough, but it never occurred to any one 
                to put a little piece in the lamp.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Here I am now with my rare powers,&quot; thought the lamp, 
                &quot;I have<br>
                faculties within me, but I cannot share them; they do not know 
                that<br>
                I could cover these white walls with beautiful tapestry, or change<br>
                them into noble forests, or, indeed, to anything else they might<br>
                wish for.&quot; The lamp, however, was always kept clean and shining 
                in a<br>
                corner where it attracted all eyes. Strangers looked upon it as<br>
                lumber, but the old people did not care for that; they loved the 
                lamp.<br>
                One day- it was the watchman's birthday- the old woman approached<br>
                the lamp, smiling to herself, and said, &quot;I will have an illumination<br>
                to-day in honor of my old man.&quot; And the lamp rattled in his 
                metal<br>
                frame, for he thought, &quot;Now at last I shall have a light 
                within me,&quot;<br>
                but after all no wax light was placed in the lamp, but oil as 
                usual.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The lamp burned through the whole evening, and began to perceive 
                too clearly that the gift of the stars would remain a hidden treasure<br>
                all his life. Then he had a dream; for, to one with his faculties,<br>
                dreaming was no difficulty. It appeared to him that the old people<br>
                were dead, and that he had been taken to the iron foundry to be 
                melted down. It caused him quite as much anxiety as on the day 
                when he had been called upon to appear before the mayor and the 
                council at the town-hall. But though he had been endowed with 
                the power of falling into decay from rust when he pleased, he 
                did not make use of it. He was therefore put into the melting-furnace 
                and changed into as elegant an iron candlestick as you could wish 
                to see, one intended to hold a wax taper. The candlestick was 
                in the form of an angel holding a nosegay, in the centre of which 
                the wax taper was to be placed. It was to stand on a green writing 
                table, in a very pleasant room; many books were scattered about, 
                and splendid paintings hung on the walls. The owner of the room 
                was a poet, and a man of intellect; everything he thought or wrote 
                was pictured around him. Nature showed herself to him sometimes 
                in the dark forests, at others in cheerful meadows where the storks 
                were strutting about, or on the deck of a ship sailing across 
                the foaming sea with the clear, blue sky above, or at night the 
                glittering stars. &quot;What powers I possess!&quot; said the 
                lamp, awaking from his dream; &quot;I could almost wish to be 
                melted down; but no, that must not be while the old people live. 
                They love me for myself alone, they keep me bright, and supply 
                me with oil. I am as well off as the picture of the congress, 
                in which they take so much pleasure.&quot; And from that time 
                he felt at rest in himself, and not more so than such an honorable 
                old lamp really deserved to be.</p>

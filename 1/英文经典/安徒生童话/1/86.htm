              <p class="h" align="center"> THE PRINCESS AND THE PEA</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> ONCE upon a time there was a prince who wanted to marry a<br>
                princess; but she would have to be a real princess. He travelled 
                all<br>
                over the world to find one, but nowhere could he get what he wanted.<br>
                There were princesses enough, but it was difficult to find out 
                whether<br>
                they were real ones. There was always something about them that 
                was<br>
                not as it should be. So he came home again and was sad, for he 
                would have liked very much to have a real princess.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and<br>
                lightning, and the rain poured down in torrents. Suddenly a knocking<br>
                was heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open it.<br>
                It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. But,<br>
                good gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made her 
                look.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The water ran down from her hair and clothes; it ran down into 
                the<br>
                toes of her shoes and out again at the heels. And yet she said 
                that<br>
                she was a real princess.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, we'll soon find that out,&quot; thought the old queen. 
                But she<br>
                said nothing, went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off 
                the<br>
                bedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took twenty<br>
                mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down 
                beds on top of the mattresses.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning she<br>
                was asked how she had slept.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, very badly!&quot; said she. &quot;I have scarcely closed 
                my eyes all<br>
                night. Heaven only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying 
                on<br>
                something hard, so that I am black and blue all over my body. 
                It's<br>
                horrible!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt<br>
                the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty<br>
                eider-down beds.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that.<br>
              </p>
              <p>So the prince took her for his wife, for now he knew that he 
                had a<br>
                real princess; and the pea was put in the museum, where it may 
                still<br>
                be seen, if no one has stolen it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There, that is a true story.</p>

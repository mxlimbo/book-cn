              <p class="h" align="center"> THE LITTLE ELDER-TREE MOTHER</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THERE was once a little boy who had caught cold; he had gone 
                out<br>
                and got wet feet. Nobody had the least idea how it had happened; 
                the<br>
                weather was quite dry. His mother undressed him, put him to bed, 
                and ordered the teapot to be brought in, that she might make him 
                a good cup of tea from the elder-tree blossoms, which is so warming. 
              </p>
              <p>At the same time, the kind-hearted old man who lived by himself 
                in the upper storey of the house came in; he led a lonely life, 
                for he had no wife and children; but he loved the children of 
                others very much,<br>
                and he could tell so many fairy tales and stories, that it was 
                a<br>
                pleasure to hear him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now, drink your tea,&quot; said the mother; &quot;perhaps 
                you will hear a<br>
                story.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, if I only knew a fresh one,&quot; said the old man, 
                and nodded<br>
                smilingly. &quot;But how did the little fellow get his wet feet?&quot; 
                he then<br>
                asked.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That,&quot; replied the mother, &quot;nobody can understand.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Will you tell me a story?&quot; asked the boy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, if you can tell me as nearly as possible how deep 
                is the<br>
                gutter in the little street where you go to school.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Just half as high as my top-boots,&quot; replied the boy; 
                &quot;but then<br>
                I must stand in the deepest holes.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There, now we know where you got your wet feet,&quot; said 
                the old<br>
                man. &quot;I ought to tell you a story, but the worst of it is, 
                I do not<br>
                know any more.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You can make one up,&quot; said the little boy. &quot;Mother 
                says you can<br>
                tell a fairy tale about anything you look at or touch.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is all very well, but such tales or stories are worth<br>
                nothing! No, the right ones come by themselves and knock at my<br>
                forehead saying: 'Here I am.'&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Will not one knock soon?&quot; asked the boy; and the mother 
                smiled<br>
                while she put elder-tree blossoms into the teapot and poured boiling<br>
                water over them. &quot;Pray, tell me a story.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, if stories came by themselves; they are so proud, 
                they<br>
                only come when they please.- But wait,&quot; he said suddenly, 
                &quot;there is<br>
                one. Look at the teapot; there is a story in it now.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the little boy looked at the teapot; the lid rose up<br>
                gradually, the elder-tree blossoms sprang forth one by one, fresh<br>
                and white; long boughs came forth; even out of the spout they 
                grew<br>
                up in all directions, and formed a bush- nay, a large elder tree,<br>
                which stretched its branches up to the bed and pushed the curtains<br>
                aside; and there were so many blossoms and such a sweet fragrance!<br>
                In the midst of the tree sat a kindly-looking old woman with a 
                strange<br>
                dress; it was as green as the leaves, and trimmed with large white<br>
                blossoms, so that it was difficult to say whether it was real 
                cloth,<br>
                or the leaves and blossoms of the elder-tree.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What is this woman's name?&quot; asked the little boy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, the Romans and Greeks used to call her a Dryad,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                old man; &quot;but we do not understand that. Out in the sailors' 
                quarter<br>
                they give her a better name; there she is called elder-tree mother.<br>
                Now, you must attentively listen to her and look at the beautiful<br>
                elder-tree.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Just such a large tree, covered with flowers, stands out 
                there;<br>
                it grew in the corner of an humble little yard; under this tree 
                sat<br>
                two old people one afternoon in the beautiful sunshine. He was 
                an old, old sailor, and she his old wife; they had already<br>
                great-grandchildren, and were soon to celebrate their golden<br>
                wedding, but they could not remember the date, and the elder-tree<br>
                mother was sitting in the tree and looked as pleased as this one 
                here.<br>
                'I know very well when the golden wedding is to take place,' she 
                said;<br>
                but they did not hear it- they were talking of bygone days.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Well, do you remember?' said the old sailor, 'when we 
                were quite<br>
                small and used to run about and play- it was in the very same 
                yard<br>
                where we now are- we used to put little branches into the ground 
                and<br>
                make a garden.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Yes,' said the old woman, 'I remember it very well; we 
                used to<br>
                water the branches, and one of them, an elder-tree branch, took<br>
                root, and grew and became the large tree under which we are now<br>
                sitting as old people.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Certainly, you are right,' he said; 'and in yonder corner<br>
                stood a large water-tub; there I used to sail my boat, which I 
                had cut<br>
                out myself- it sailed so well; but soon I had to sail somewhere 
                else.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'But first we went to school to learn something,' she said,<br>
                'and then we were confirmed; we both wept on that day, but in 
                the<br>
                afternoon we went out hand in hand, and ascended the high round<br>
                tower and looked out into the wide world right over Copenhagen 
                and the sea; then we walked to Fredericksburg, where the king 
                and the queen were sailing about in their magnificent boat on 
                the canals.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'But soon I had to sail about somewhere else, and for many<br>
                years I was travelling about far away from home.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'And I often cried about you, for I was afraid lest you 
                were<br>
                drowned and lying at the bottom of the sea. Many a time I got 
                up in<br>
                the night and looked if the weathercock had turned; it turned 
                often,<br>
                but you did not return. I remember one day distinctly: the rain 
                was<br>
                pouring down in torrents; the dust-man had come to the house where 
                I was in service; I went down with the dust-bin and stood for 
                a moment in the doorway, and looked at the dreadful weather. Then 
                the postman gave me a letter; it was from you. Heavens! how that 
                letter had travelled about. I tore it open and read it; I cried 
                and laughed at<br>
                the same time, and was so happy! Therein was written that you 
                were<br>
                staying in the hot countries, where the coffee grows. These must 
                be<br>
                marvellous countries. You said a great deal about them, and I 
                read all<br>
                while the rain was pouring down and I was standing there with 
                the<br>
                dust-bin. Then suddenly some one put his arm round my waist-'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Yes, and you gave him a hearty smack on the cheek,' said 
                the old<br>
                man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'I did not know that it was you- you had come as quickly 
                as<br>
                your letter; and you looked so handsome, and so you do still. 
                You<br>
                had a large yellow silk handkerchief in your pocket and a shining<br>
                hat on. You looked so well, and the weather in the street was<br>
                horrible!'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Then we married,' he said. 'Do you remember how we got 
                our first<br>
                boy, and then Mary, Niels, Peter, John, and Christian?'<br>
              </p>
              <p>'Oh yes; and now they have all grown up, and have become useful<br>
                members of society, whom everybody cares for.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'And their children have had children again,' said the 
                old<br>
                sailor. 'Yes, these are children's children, and they are strong 
                and<br>
                healthy. If I am not mistaken, our wedding took place at this 
                season<br>
                of the year.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Yes, to-day is your golden wedding-day,' said the little<br>
                elder-tree mother, stretching her head down between the two old<br>
                people, who thought that she was their neighbour who was nodding 
                to them; they looked at each other and clasped hands. Soon afterwards 
                the children and grandchildren came, for they knew very well that 
                it was the golden wedding-day; they had already wished them joy 
                and happiness in the morning, but the old people had forgotten 
                it, although they remembered things so well that had passed many, 
                many years ago. The elder-tree smelt strongly, and the setting 
                sun illuminated the faces of the two old people, so that they 
                looked quite rosy; the youngest of the grandchildren danced round 
                them, and cried merrily that there would be a feast in the evening, 
                for they were to have hot potatoes; and the elder mother nodded 
                in the tree and cried 'Hooray' with the others.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But that was no fairy tale,&quot; said the little boy who 
                had listened<br>
                to it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You will presently understand it,&quot; said the old man 
                who told<br>
                the story. &quot;Let us ask little elder-tree mother about it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That was no fairy tale,&quot; said the little elder-tree 
                mother;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;but now it comes! Real life furnishes us with subjects 
                for the most<br>
                wonderful fairy tales; for otherwise my beautiful elder-bush could 
                not<br>
                have grown forth out of the teapot.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And then she took the little boy out of bed and placed him on<br>
                her bosom; the elder branches, full of blossoms, closed over them;<br>
                it was as if they sat in a thick leafy bower which flew with them<br>
                through the air; it was beautiful beyond all description. The 
                little<br>
                elder-tree mother had suddenly become a charming young girl, but 
                her dress was still of the same green material, covered with white<br>
                blossoms, as the elder-tree mother had worn; she had a real elder<br>
                blossom on her bosom, and a wreath of the same flowers was wound 
                round her curly golden hair; her eyes were so large and so blue 
                that it<br>
                was wonderful to look at them. She and the boy kissed each other,<br>
                and then they were of the same age and felt the same joys. They 
                walked hand in hand out of the bower, and now stood at home in 
                a beautiful flower garden. Near the green lawn the father's walking-stick 
                was tied to a post. There was life in this stick for the little 
                ones, for as<br>
                soon as they seated themselves upon it the polished knob turned 
                into a neighing horse's head, a long black mane was fluttering 
                in the wind,<br>
                and four strong slender legs grew out. The animal was fiery and<br>
                spirited; they galloped round the lawn. &quot;Hooray! now we shall 
                ride far<br>
                away, many miles!&quot; said the boy; &quot;we shall ride to the 
                nobleman's<br>
                estate where we were last year.&quot; And they rode round the 
                lawn again,<br>
                and the little girl, who, as we know, was no other than the little<br>
                elder-tree mother, continually cried, &quot;Now we are in the 
                country! Do<br>
                you see the farmhouse there, with the large baking stove, which<br>
                projects like a gigantic egg out of the wall into the road? The<br>
                elder-tree spreads its branches over it, and the cock struts about 
                and<br>
                scratches for the hens. Look how proud he is! Now we are near 
                the<br>
                church; it stands on a high hill, under the spreading oak trees; 
                one<br>
                of them is half dead! Now we are at the smithy, where the fire 
                roars<br>
                and the half-naked men beat with their hammers so that the sparks<br>
                fly far and wide. Let's be off to the beautiful farm!&quot; And 
                they passed<br>
                by everything the little girl, who was sitting behind on the stick,<br>
                described, and the boy saw it, and yet they only went round the<br>
                lawn. Then they played in a side-walk, and marked out a little<br>
                garden on the ground; she took elder-blossoms out of her hair 
                and<br>
                planted them, and they grew exactly like those the old people<br>
                planted when they were children, as we have heard before. They<br>
                walked about hand in hand, just as the old couple had done when 
                they were little, but they did not go to the round tower nor to 
                the<br>
                Fredericksburg garden. No; the little girl seized the boy round 
                the<br>
                waist, and then they flew far into the country. It was spring 
                and it<br>
                became summer, it was autumn and it became winter, and thousands 
                of pictures reflected themselves in the boy's eyes and heart, 
                and the<br>
                little girl always sang again, &quot;You will never forget that!&quot; 
                And<br>
                during their whole flight the elder-tree smelt so sweetly; he<br>
                noticed the roses and the fresh beeches, but the elder-tree smelt 
                much<br>
                stronger, for the flowers were fixed on the little girl's bosom,<br>
                against which the boy often rested his head during the flight.<br>
                &quot;It is beautiful here in spring,&quot; said the little girl, 
                and they<br>
                were again in the green beechwood, where the thyme breathed forth<br>
                sweet fragrance at their feet, and the pink anemones looked lovely<br>
                in the green moss. &quot;Oh! that it were always spring in the 
                fragrant<br>
                beechwood!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Here it is splendid in summer!&quot; she said, and they 
                passed by<br>
                old castles of the age of chivalry. The high walls and indented<br>
                battlements were reflected in the water of the ditches, on which 
                swans<br>
                were swimming and peering into the old shady avenues. The corn 
                waved in the field like a yellow sea. Red and yellow flowers grew 
                in the ditches, wild hops and convolvuli in full bloom in the 
                hedges. In<br>
                the evening the moon rose, large and round, and the hayricks in 
                the<br>
                meadows smelt sweetly. &quot;One can never forget it!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Here it is beautiful in autumn!&quot; said the little girl, 
                and the<br>
                atmosphere seemed twice as high and blue, while the wood shone 
                with crimson, green, and gold. The hounds were running off, flocks 
                of wild fowl flew screaming over the barrows, while the bramble 
                bushes twined round the old stones. The dark-blue sea was covered 
                with white-sailed ships, and in the barns sat old women, girls, 
                and<br>
                children picking hops into a large tub; the young ones sang songs, 
                and the old people told fairy tales about goblins and sorcerers. 
                It<br>
                could not be more pleasant anywhere.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Here it's agreeable in winter!&quot; said the little girl, 
                and all the<br>
                trees were covered with hoar-frost, so that they looked like white<br>
                coral. The snow creaked under one's feet, as if one had new boots<br>
                on. One shooting star after another traversed the sky. In the 
                room the<br>
                Christmas tree was lit, and there were song and merriment. In 
                the<br>
                peasant's cottage the violin sounded, and games were played for<br>
                apple quarters; even the poorest child said, &quot;It is beautiful 
                in<br>
                winter!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And indeed it was beautiful! And the little girl showed everything<br>
                to the boy, and the elder-tree continued to breathe forth sweet<br>
                perfume, while the red flag with the white cross was streaming 
                in<br>
                the wind; it was the flag under which the old sailor had served. 
                The<br>
                boy became a youth; he was to go out into the wide world, far 
                away<br>
                to the countries where the coffee grows. But at parting the little<br>
                girl took an elder-blossom from her breast and gave it to him 
                as a<br>
                keepsake. He placed it in his prayer-book, and when he opened 
                it in<br>
                distant lands it was always at the place where the flower of<br>
                remembrance was lying; and the more he looked at it the fresher 
                it<br>
                became, so that he could almost smell the fragrance of the woods 
                at<br>
                home. He distinctly saw the little girl, with her bright blue 
                eyes,<br>
                peeping out from behind the petals, and heard her whispering, 
                &quot;Here it is beautiful in spring, in summer, in autumn, and 
                in winter,&quot; and<br>
                hundreds of pictures passed through his mind.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Thus many years rolled by. He had now become an old man, and 
                was<br>
                sitting, with his old wife, under an elder-tree in full bloom. 
                They<br>
                held each other by the hand exactly as the great-grandfather and 
                the<br>
                great-grandmother had done outside, and, like them, they talked<br>
                about bygone days and of their golden wedding. The little girl 
                with<br>
                the blue eyes and elder-blossoms in her hair was sitting high 
                up in<br>
                the tree, and nodded to them, saying, &quot;To-day is the golden<br>
                wedding!&quot; And then she took two flowers out of her wreath 
                and kissed them. They glittered at first like silver, then like 
                gold, and when<br>
                she placed them on the heads of the old people each flower became 
                a<br>
                golden crown. There they both sat like a king and queen under 
                the<br>
                sweet-smelling tree, which looked exactly like an elder-tree, 
                and he<br>
                told his wife the story of the elder-tree mother as it had been 
                told<br>
                him when he was a little boy. They were both of opinion that the 
                story<br>
                contained many points like their own, and these similarities they<br>
                liked best.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, so it is,&quot; said the little girl in the tree. 
                &quot;Some call me<br>
                Little Elder-tree Mother; others a Dryad; but my real name is<br>
                'Remembrance.' It is I who sit in the tree which grows and grows. 
                I<br>
                can remember things and tell stories! But let's see if you have<br>
                still got your flower.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the old man opened his prayer-book; the elder-blossom was<br>
                still in it, and as fresh as if it had only just been put in.<br>
                Remembrance nodded, and the two old people, with the golden crowns 
                on their heads, sat in the glowing evening sun. They closed their 
                eyes and- and-<br>
              </p>
              <p>Well, now the story is ended! The little boy in bed did not know<br>
                whether he had dreamt it or heard it told; the teapot stood on 
                the<br>
                table, but no elder-tree was growing out of it, and the old man 
                who<br>
                had told the story was on the point of leaving the room, and he 
                did go<br>
                out.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How beautiful it was!&quot; said the little boy. &quot;Mother, 
                I have<br>
                been to warm countries!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I believe you,&quot; said the mother; &quot;if one takes 
                two cups of hot<br>
                elder-tea it is quite natural that one gets into warm countries!&quot;<br>
                And she covered him up well, so that he might not take cold. &quot;You 
                have slept soundly while I was arguing with the old man whether 
                it was a story or a fairy tale!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And what has become of the little elder-tree mother?&quot; 
                asked the<br>
                boy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;She is in the teapot,&quot; said the mother; &quot;and 
                there she may<br>
                remain.&quot;<br>
              </p>

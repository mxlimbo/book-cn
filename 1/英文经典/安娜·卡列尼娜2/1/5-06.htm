              <p><br>
                When the ceremony of plighting troth was over, the sacristan spread 
                before the lectern in the middle of the church a piece of pink 
                silken stuff, the choir sang a complicated and elaborate psalm, 
                in which the bass and tenor sang responses to one another, and 
                the priest, turning round, pointed the bridal pair to the pink 
                silk rug. Though both had often heard a great deal about the saying 
                that the one who steps first on the rug will be the head of the 
                house, neither Levin nor Kitty were capable of recollecting it, 
                as they took the few steps toward it. They did not hear the loud 
                remarks and disputes that followed, some maintaining he had stepped 
                on it first, and others that both had stepped on it together. 
              </p>
              <p>After the customary questions, whether they desired to enter 
                upon matrimony, and whether they were pledged to anyone else, 
                and their answers, which sounded strange to themselves, a new 
                ceremony began. Kitty listened to the words of the prayer, trying 
                to make out their meaning, but she could not. The feeling of triumph 
                and radiant happiness flooded her soul more and more as the ceremony 
                went on, and deprived her of all power of attention. </p>
              <p> They prayed: `Endow them with continence and fruitfulness, and 
                vouchsafe that their hearts may rejoice looking upon their sons 
                and daughters.' They alluded to God's creation of a wife from 
                Adam's rib, `and for this cause a man shall leave father and mother, 
                and cleave unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh,' and 
                that `this is a great mystery;' they prayed that God would make 
                them fruitful and bless them, like Isaac and Rebecca, Joseph, 
                Moses and Zipporah, and that they might look upon their children's 
                children. `That's all splendid,' thought Kitty, catching the words, 
                `all that's just as it should be,' and a smile of happiness, unconsciously 
                reflected in everyone who looked at her, beamed on her radiant 
                face. </p>
              <p> `Put it on completely!' voices were heard urging when, after 
                the priest had put on their wedding crowns, and Shcherbatsky, 
                his hand shaking in its three-button glove, was holding the crown 
                high above her head. </p>
              <p> `Put it on!' she whispered smiling. </p>
              <p> Levin looked round at her, and was struck by the joyful radiance 
                on her face, and unconsciously her feeling infected him. He too, 
                like her, felt joyous and happy. </p>
              <p> They enjoyed hearing the Epistle read, and the roll of the protodeacon's 
                voice at the last verse, awaited with such impatience by the outside 
                public. They enjoyed drinking out of the shallow cup of warm red 
                wine and water, and they were still more pleased when the priest, 
                flinging back his stole and taking both their hands in his, led 
                them round the lectern to the accompaniment of bass voices chanting: 
                `Isaiah rejoice!' Shcherbatsky and Chirikov, supporting the crowns 
                and stumbling over the bride's train, smiling too and seeming 
                delighted at something, were at one moment left behind, at the 
                next treading on the bridal pair as the priest came to a halt. 
                The spark of joy kindled in Kitty seemed to have infected everyone 
                in the church. It seemed to Levin that the priest and the deacon 
                too wanted to smile, just as he did. </p>
              <p> Taking the crowns off their heads the priest read the last prayer 
                and congratulated the young couple. Levin looked at Kitty, and 
                he had never before seen her look as she did. She was charming 
                with the new radiance of happiness in her face. Levin longed to 
                say something to her, but he did not know whether it was all over. 
                The priest got him out of his difficulty. He smiled his kindly 
                smile and said gently, `Kiss your wife - and you kiss your husband,' 
                and took the candles out of their hands. </p>
              <p> Levin kissed her smiling lips with timid care, gave her his 
                arm, and, with a new strange sense of closeness, walked out of 
                the church. He did not believe, he could not believe, that it 
                was true. It was only when their wondering and timid eyes met 
                that he believed in it, because he felt that they were one. </p>
              <p> After supper, the same night, the young people left for the 
                country. </p>

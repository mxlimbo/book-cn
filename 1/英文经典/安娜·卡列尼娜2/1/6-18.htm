                Anna looked at Dolly's thin, careworn face, with its wrinkles 
                filled with dust from the road, and she was on the point of saying 
                what she was thinking - that is, that Dolly had grown thinner. 
                But, conscious that she herself had grown handsomer, and that 
                Dolly's eyes were telling her so, she sighed and began to speak 
                about herself. </p>
              <p>`You are looking at me,' she said, `and wondering how I can be 
                happy in my position? Well! It's shameful to confess, but I... 
                I'm inexcusably happy. Something magical has happened to me, like 
                a dream, when you're frightened, panic-stricken, and all of a 
                sudden you wake up and all the horrors are no more. I have waked 
                up. I have lived through the misery, the dread, and now for a 
                long while past, especially since we've been here, I've been so 
                happy!...' she said, with a timid smile of inquiry looking at 
                Dolly. </p>
              <p> `How glad I am!' said Dolly smiling, involuntarily speaking 
                more coldly than she wanted to. `I'm very glad for you. Why haven't 
                you written to me?' </p>
              <p> `Why?... Because I hadn't the courage.... You forget my position....' 
              </p>
              <p> `To me? Hadn't the courage? If you knew how I... I look at...' 
              </p>
              <p> Darya Alexandrovna wanted to express her thoughts of the morning, 
                but for some reason it seemed to her now out of place to do so. 
              </p>
              <p> `But of that we'll talk later. What's this - what are all these 
                buildings?' she asked, wanting to change the conversation and 
                pointing to the red and green roofs that came into view behind 
                the green hedges of acacia and lilac. `Quite a little town.' </p>
              <p> But Anna did not answer. </p>
              <p> `No, no! How do you look at my position, what do you think of 
                it?' she asked. </p>
              <p> `I consider...' Darya Alexandrovna was beginning, but at that 
                instant Vassenka Veslovsky, having brought the cob to gallop with 
                the right leg foremost, galloped past them, bumping heavily up 
                and down in his short jacket on the chamois leather of the sidesaddle. 
                `He's doing it, Anna Arkadyevna!' he shouted. Anna did not even 
                glance at him; but again it seemed to Darya Alexandrovna out of 
                place to enter upon such a long conversation in the carriage, 
                and so she cut short her thought. </p>
              <p> `I don't think anything,' she said, `but I always loved you, 
                and if one loves anyone, one loves the whole person, just as that 
                person is, and not as one would like her or him to be....' </p>
              <p> Anna, taking her eyes off her friend's face and dropping her 
                eyelids (this was a new habit Dolly had not seen in her before), 
                pondered, trying to penetrate the full significance of the words. 
                And obviously interpreting them as she would have wished, she 
                glanced at Dolly. </p>
              <p> `If you had any sins,' she said, `they would all be forgiven 
                you for your coming to see me, and these words.' </p>
              <p> And Dolly saw that the tears stood in her eyes. She pressed 
                Anna's hand in silence. </p>
              <p> `Well, what are these buildings? How many there are of them!' 
                After a moment's silence she repeated her question. </p>
              <p> `These are the servant's houses, stud farm, and stables,' answered 
                Anna. `And there the park begins. It had all gone to ruin, but 
                Alexei had everything renewed. He is very fond of this place, 
                and, what I never expected, he has become intensely interested 
                in looking after it. But his is such a rich nature! Whatever he 
                takes up, he does splendidly. So far from being bored by it, he 
                works with passionate interest. He - with his temperament as I 
                know it - he has become careful and businesslike, a first-rate 
                manager, he positively reckons every penny in his management of 
                the land. But only in that. When it's a question of tens of thousands, 
                he doesn't think of money.' She spoke with that gleefully sly 
                smile with which women often talk of the secret characteristics 
                - only known to them - of those they love. `Do you see that big 
                building? That's the new hospital. I believe it will cost over 
                a hundred thousand; that's his dada just now. And do you know 
                how it all came about? The peasants asked him for some meadowland, 
                I think it was, at a cheaper rate, and he refused, and I accused 
                him of being miserly. Of course it was not really because of that, 
                but because of everything together - he began this hospital to 
                prove, do you see, that he was not miserly about money. C'est 
                une petitesse, if you like, but I love him all the more for it. 
                And now you'll see the house in a moment. It was his grandfather's 
                house, and he has had nothing changed outside.' </p>
              <p> `How beautiful!' said Dolly, looking with involuntary admiration 
                at the handsome house with columns, standing out among the different-colored 
                greens of the old trees in the garden. </p>
              <p> `Isn't it fine? And from the house, from the top, the view is 
                wonderful.' </p>
              <p> They drove into a courtyard strewn with gravel and bright with 
                flowers, in which two laborers were at work putting an edging 
                of stones round the light mold of a flower bed, and drew up in 
                a covered entry. </p>
              <p> `Ah, they're here already!' said Anna, looking at the saddle 
                horses, which were just being led away from the steps. `It is 
                a good horse, isn't it? It's my cob; my favorite. Lead him here 
                and bring me some sugar. Where is the Count?' she inquired of 
                two smart footmen who darted out. `Ah, there he is!' she said, 
                seeing Vronsky coming to meet her with Veslovsky. </p>
              <p> `Where are you going to put the Princess?' said Vronsky in French, 
                addressing Anna, and without waiting for a reply, he once more 
                greeted Darya Alexandrovna, and this time he kissed her hand. 
                `I think the big balcony room.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, no, that's too far off! Better in the corner room, we shall 
                see each other more. Come, let's go up,' said Anna, as she gave 
                her favorite horse the sugar the footman had brought her. </p>
              <p> `Et vous oubliez votre devoir,' she said to Veslovsky, who came 
                out too on the steps. </p>
              <p> `Pardon, j'en ai tout plein les poches,' he answered, smiling, 
                putting his fingers in his waistcoat pocket. </p>
              <p> `Mais vous venez trop tard,' she said, rubbing her handkerchief 
                on her hand, which the horse had made wet in taking the sugar. 
              </p>
              <p> Anna turned to Dolly, `You can stay some time? For one day only? 
                That's impossible!' </p>
              <p> `I promised to be back, and the children...' said Dolly, feeling 
                embarrassed both because she had to get her bag out of the carriage, 
                and because she knew her face must be covered with dust. </p>
              <p> `No, Dolly, darling!... Well, we'll see. Come along, come along!' 
                and Anna led Dolly to her room. </p>
              <p> That room was not the smart guestchamber Vronsky had suggested, 
                but the one which Anna had said Dolly would surely excuse. And 
                this room, for which excuse was needed, was more full of luxury 
                than any in which Dolly had ever stayed, a luxury that reminded 
                her of the best hotels abroad. </p>
              <p> `Well, darling, how happy I am!' Anna said, sitting down in 
                her riding habit for a moment beside Dolly. `Tell me about all 
                of you. Stiva I had only a glimpse of, and he cannot tell one 
                about the children. How is my favorite, Tania? Quite a big girl, 
                I expect?' </p>
              <p> `Yes, she's very tall,' Darya Alexandrovna answered shortly, 
                surprised herself that she should respond so coolly about her 
                children. `We are having a delightful stay at the Levins',' she 
                added. </p>
              <p> `Oh, if I had known,' said Anna, `that you do not despise me!... 
                You might have all come to us. Stiva's an old friend and a great 
                friend of Alexei's, you know,' she added, and suddenly she blushed. 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, but we are all...' Dolly answered in confusion. </p>
              <p> `But in my delight I'm talking nonsense. The one thing, darling, 
                is that I am so glad to have you!' said Anna, kissing her again. 
                `You haven't told me yet how and what you think about me, and 
                I keep wanting to know. But I'm glad you will see me as I am. 
                The chief thing I shouldn't like would be for people to imagine 
                I want to prove anything. I don't want to prove anything; I merely 
                want to live, to do no one harm but myself. I have the right to 
                do that, haven't I? But it is a big subject, and we'll talk over 
                everything properly later. Now I'll go and dress and send a maid 
                to you.' </p>

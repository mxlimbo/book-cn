              <p><br>
                On the terrace were assembled all the ladies of the party. They 
                always liked sitting there after dinner, and that day they had 
                work to do there too. Besides the sewing of baby's chemises and 
                knitting of swaddles, with which all of them were busy, that afternoon 
                jam was being made on the terrace by a method new to Agathya Mikhailovna, 
                without the addition of water. Kitty had introduced this new method, 
                which had been in use in her home. Agathya Mikhailovna, to whom 
                the task of jam making had always been intrusted, considering 
                that what had been done in the Levin household could not be amiss, 
                had nevertheless put water with the strawberries, maintaining 
                that the jam could not be made without it. She had been caught 
                in the act, and was now making raspberry jam before everyone, 
                and it was to be proved to her conclusively that jam could be 
                very well made without water. </p>
              <p>Agathya Mikhailovna, her face heated and angry, her hair untidy, 
                and her thin arms bare to the elbows, was swaying the preserving 
                pan in a circular motion over the charcoal stove, looking darkly 
                at the raspberries and devoutly hoping they would stick and not 
                cook properly. The Princess, conscious that Agathya Mikhailovna's 
                wrath must be chiefly directed against her, as the person responsible 
                for the raspberry jam making, tried to appear to be absorbed in 
                other things and not interested in the raspberries, talking of 
                other matters, but cast stealthy glances in the direction of the 
                stove. </p>
              <p> `I always buy my maids' dresses myself, at the bargain sale,' 
                the Princess said, continuing the previous conversation. `Isn't 
                it time to skim it, my dear?' she added, addressing Agathya Mikhailovna. 
                `There's not the slightest need for you to do it, and it's hot 
                for you,' she said, stopping Kitty. </p>
              <p> `I'll do it,' said Dolly, and, getting up, she carefully passed 
                the spoon over the frothing sugar, and from time to time shook 
                off the clinging jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate 
                that was covered with yellow-red scum and blood-colored syrup. 
                `How they'll lick this at teatime!' she thought of her children, 
                remembering how she herself as a child had wondered how it was 
                the grown-up people did not eat what was best of all - the scum 
                of the jam. </p>
              <p> `Stiva says it's much better to give money,' Dolly took up meanwhile 
                the weighty subject under discussion - of what presents should 
                be made to servants. `But...' </p>
              <p> `Money's out of the question!' the Princess and Kitty exclaimed 
                with one voice. `They appreciate a present...' </p>
              <p> `Well, last year, for instance, I bought our Matriona Semionovna, 
                not a poplin, but something of that sort,' said the Princess. 
              </p>
              <p> `I remember she was wearing it on your name day.' </p>
              <p> `A charming pattern - so simple and refined - I should have 
                liked it myself, if she hadn't had it. Something like Varenka's. 
                So pretty and inexpensive.' </p>
              <p> `Well, now I think it's done,' said Dolly, dropping the syrup 
                from the spoon. </p>
              <p> `When it sets as it drops, it's ready. Cook it a little longer, 
                Agathya Mikhailovna.' </p>
              <p> `The flies!' said Agathya Mikhailovna angrily. `It'll be just 
                the same,' she added. </p>
              <p> `Ah! How sweet it is! Don't frighten it!' Kitty said suddenly, 
                looking at a sparrow that had settled on the step and was pecking 
                at the center of a raspberry. </p>
              <p> `Yes, but you keep a little further from the stove,' said her 
                mother. </p>
              <p> `A propos de Varenka,' said Kitty, speaking in French, as they 
                had been doing all the while, so that Agathya Mikhailovna should 
                not understand them, `you know, maman, I somehow expect things 
                to be settled today. You know what I mean. How splendid it would 
                be!' </p>
              <p> `But what a famous matchmaker she is!' said Dolly. `How carefully 
                and cleverly she throws them together!...' </p>
              <p> `No - tell me, mamma, what do you think?' </p>
              <p> `Why, what is one to think? He' (``he' meant Sergei Ivanovich) 
                `might at any time have been one of the best matches in Russia; 
                now, of course, he's not quite a young man, still I know ever 
                so many girls would be glad to marry him, even now.... She's a 
                very nice girl, but he might...' </p>
              <p> `Oh, no, mamma, do understand why, for him and for her too, 
                nothing better could be imagined. In the first place, she's charming!' 
                said Kitty, crooking one of her fingers. </p>
              <p> `He thinks her very attractive, that's certain,' assented Dolly. 
              </p>
              <p> `Then he occupies such a position in society that he has no 
                need to look for either fortune or position in his wife. All he 
                needs is a good, sweet wife - a restful one.' </p>
              <p> `Well, with her he would certainly be restful,' Dolly assented. 
              </p>
              <p> `Thirdly, that she should love him. And so it is... that is, 
                it would be so splendid!... I look forward to seeing them coming 
                out of the forest - and everything settled. I shall see at once 
                by their eyes. I should be so delighted! What do you think, Dolly?' 
              </p>
              <p> `But don't excite yourself. It's not at all the thing for you 
                to be excited,' said her mother. </p>
              <p> `Oh, I'm not excited, mamma. I fancy he will propose to her 
                today.' </p>
              <p> `Ah, that's so strange - how and when a man proposes!... There 
                is a sort of barrier, and all at once it's broken down,' said 
                Dolly, smiling pensively and recalling her past with Stepan Arkadyevich. 
              </p>
              <p> `Mamma, how did papa propose to you?' Kitty asked suddenly. 
              </p>
              <p> `There was nothing out of the way - it was very simple,' answered 
                the Princess, but her face beamed all over at the recollection. 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, but how was it? You loved him, at any rate, before you 
                were allowed to speak?' </p>
              <p> Kitty felt a peculiar pleasure in being able now to talk to 
                her mother on equal terms about those questions of such paramount 
                interest in a woman's life. </p>
              <p> `Of course I did; he had come to stay with us in the country.' 
              </p>
              <p> `But how was it settled between you, mamma?' </p>
              <p> `You imagine, I dare say, that you invented something quite 
                new? It's always just the same: it was settled by the eyes, by 
                smiles...' </p>
              <p> `How well you said that, mamma! It's just by the eyes, by smiles 
                that it's done,' Dolly assented. </p>
              <p> `But what words did he say?' </p>
              <p> `What did Kostia say to you?' </p>
              <p> `He wrote it in chalk. It was wonderful.... How long ago it 
                seems!' she said. </p>
              <p> And the three women all fell to musing on the same thing. Kitty 
                was the first to break the silence. She remembered all that last 
                winter before her marriage, and her passion for Vronsky. </p>
              <p> `There's one thing... that old love affair of Varenka's,' she 
                said, a natural chain of ideas bringing her to this point. `I 
                should have liked to say something to Sergei Ivanovich, to prepare 
                him. They're all - all men, I mean,' - she added, `awfully jealous 
                over our past.' </p>
              <p> `Not all,' said Dolly. `You judge by your own husband. It makes 
                him miserable even now to remember Vronsky. Eh? that's true, isn't 
                it?' </p>
              <p> `Yes', Kitty answered, a pensive smile in her eyes. </p>
              <p> `But I really don't know,' the mother put in in defense of her 
                motherly care of her daughter, `what there was in your past that 
                could worry him? That Vronsky paid you attentions - that happens 
                to every girl.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes, but we didn't mean that,' Kitty said, flushing a little 
              </p>
              <p> `No, let me speak,' her mother went on, `why, you yourself would 
                not let me have a talk with Vronsky. Don't you remember?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, mamma!' said Kitty, with an expression of suffering. </p>
              <p> `There's no keeping you young people in check nowadays.... Your 
                friendship could not have gone beyond what was suitable. I should 
                myself have called upon him to explain himself. But, my darling, 
                it's not right for you to be agitated. Please remember that, and 
                calm yourself.' </p>
              <p> `I'm perfectly calm, maman.' </p>
              <p> `How happy it was for Kitty that Anna came then,' said Dolly, 
                `and how unhappy for her. It turned out quite the opposite,' she 
                said, struck by her own ideas. `Then Anna was so happy, and Kitty 
                thought herself unhappy. Now it is just the opposite. I often 
                think of her.' </p>
              <p> `A fine person to think about! Horrid, repulsive woman - no 
                heart,' said her mother, who could not forget that Kitty had married 
                not Vronsky, but Levin. </p>
              <p> `What do you want to talk of it for?' Kitty said with annoyance. 
                `I never think about it, and I don't want to think of it.... And 
                I don't want to think of it,' she said, catching the sound of 
                her husband's familiar step on the steps of the terrace. </p>
              <p> `What's that you don't want to think about?' inquired Levin, 
                coming onto the terrace. </p>
              <p> But no one answered him, and he did not repeat the question. 
              </p>
              <p> `I'm sorry I've broken in on your feminine kingdom,' he said, 
                looking round on everyone discontentedly, and perceiving that 
                they had been talking of something which they would not talk about 
                before him. </p>
              <p> For a second he felt that he was sharing the feeling of Agathya 
                Mikhailovna, vexation at their making jam without water, and, 
                on the whole, at the outside, Shcherbatsky authority. He smiled, 
                however, and went up to Kitty. </p>
              <p> `Well, how are you?' he asked her, looking at her with the expression 
                with which everyone looked at her now. </p>
              <p> `Oh, very well,' said Kitty, smiling, `and how have things gone 
                with you?' </p>
              <p> `The wagon held three times as much as the telega did. Well, 
                are we going for the children? I've ordered the horses to be put 
                in.' </p>
              <p> `What! You want to take Kitty in the wide droshky?' her mother 
                said reproachfully. </p>
              <p> `Yes - at walking pace, Princess.' </p>
              <p> Levin never called the princess `maman' as men often do call 
                their mothers-in-law, and the Princess disliked his not doing 
                so. But though he liked and respected the Princess, Levin could 
                not call her so without a sense of profaning his feeling for his 
                dead mother. </p>
              <p> `Come with us, maman,' said Kitty. </p>
              <p> `I don't like to see such imprudence.' </p>
              <p> `Well, I'll walk then, I'm so well.' Kitty got up and went to 
                her husband and took his hand. </p>
              <p> `You may be well, but everything in moderation,' said the Princess. 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, Agathya Mikhailovna, is the jam done?' said Levin, smiling 
                to Agathya Mikhailovna, and trying to cheer her up. `Is it all 
                right in the new way?' </p>
              <p> `I suppose it's all right. According to our notions it's boiled 
                too long.' </p>
              <p> `It'll be all the better, Agathya Mikhailovna, it won't turn 
                sour, even though the ice in our icehouse has begun to melt already, 
                so that we've no cool place to store it,' said Kitty, at once 
                divining her husband's motive, and addressing the old housekeeper 
                with the same feeling; `but your pickles are so good, that mamma 
                says she never tasted any like them,' she added, smiling, and 
                putting her kerchief straight. </p>
              <p> Agathya Mikhailovna looked sulkily at Kitty. </p>
              <p> `You needn't try to console me, mistress. I need only to look 
                at you with him, and I feel happy,' she said, and something in 
                the rough familiarity of that with him touched Kitty. </p>
              <p> `Come along with us to look for mushrooms, you will show us 
                the best places.' </p>
              <p> Agathya Mikhailovna smiled and shook her head, as though to 
                say: `I would even like to be angry with you, but I can't.' </p>
              <p> `Do it, please, according to my recipe,' said the Princess; 
                `put some paper over the jam, and moisten it with a little rum, 
                and, even without ice, it will never grow moldy.' </p>

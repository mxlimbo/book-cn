              <p><br>
                Left alone, Darya Alexandrovna, with a good housewife's eye, scanned 
                her room. All she had seen in entering the house and walking through 
                it, and all she saw now in her room, gave her an impression of 
                wealth and sumptuousness and of that modern European luxury of 
                which she had only read in English novels, but had never seen 
                in Russia and in the country. Everything was new, from the new 
                French hangings on the walls to the carpet which covered the whole 
                floor. The bed had a spring mattress, and a special sort of bolster 
                and taffeta pillowcases on the small pillows. The marble washstand, 
                the dressing table, the little sofa, the tables, the bronze clock 
                on the chimney piece, the window curtains and the portieres were 
                all new and expensive. </p>
              <p>The smart maid, who came in to offer her services, with her hair 
                done up high, and a gown more fashionable that Dolly's, was as 
                new and expensive as the whole room. Darya Alexandrovna liked 
                her neatness, her deferential and obliging manners, but she felt 
                ill at ease with her. She felt ashamed of her seeing the patched 
                dressing jacket that had unluckily been packed by mistake for 
                her. She was ashamed of the very patches and darned places of 
                which she had been so proud at home. At home it had been so clear 
                that for six dressing jackets there would be needed twenty-four 
                arsheenes of nainsook at sixty-five kopecks the yard, which was 
                a matter of fifteen roubles, besides the cutting out and making, 
                and these fifteen roubles had been saved. But before the maid 
                she felt, if not exactly ashamed, at least uncomfortable. </p>
              <p> Darya Alexandrovna had a great sense of relief when Annushka, 
                whom she had known for years, walked in. The smart maid was sent 
                for to go to her mistress, and Annushka remained with Darya Alexandrovna. 
              </p>
              <p> Annushka was obviously much pleased at that lady's arrival, 
                and began to chatter away without a pause. Dolly observed that 
                she was longing to express her opinion in regard to her mistress's 
                position, especially as to the love and devotion of the Count 
                to Anna Arkadyevna, but Dolly carefully interrupted her whenever 
                she began to speak about this. </p>
              <p> `I grew up with Anna Arkadyevna; my lady's dearer to me than 
                anything. Well, it's not for us to judge. And, to be sure, there 
                seems so much love...' </p>
              <p> `Kindly order these things washed for me, please,' Darya Alexandrovna 
                cut her short. </p>
              <p> `Certainly. We've two women kept specially for washing small 
                things, but most of the linen's done by machinery. The Count goes 
                into everything himself. Ah, what a husband he would make!...' 
              </p>
              <p> Dolly was glad when Anna came in, and by her entrance put a 
                stop to Annushka's gossip. </p>
              <p> Anna had put on a very simple batiste gown. Dolly scrutinized 
                that simple gown attentively. She knew what it meant, and the 
                price at which such simplicity was obtained. </p>
              <p> `An old friend,' said Anna of Annushka. </p>
              <p> Anna was not embarrassed now. She was perfectly composed and 
                at ease. Dolly saw that she had now completely recovered from 
                the impression her arrival had made on her, and had assumed that 
                superficial, careless tone which, as it were, closed the door 
                on that compartment in which her deeper feelings and intimate 
                meditations were kept. </p>
              <p> `Well, Anna, and how is your little girl?' asked Dolly. </p>
              <p> `Annie?' (This was what she called her little daughter Anna.) 
                `Very well. She has got on wonderfully. Would you like to see 
                her? Come, I'll show her to you. We had a terrible bother,' she 
                began telling her, `over nurses. We had an Italian wet nurse. 
                A good creature, but so stupid! We wanted to get rid of her, but 
                the baby is so used to her that we've gone on keeping her still.' 
              </p>
              <p> `But how have you managed?...' Dolly was beginning a question 
                as to what name the little girl would have; but noticing a sudden 
                frown on Anna's face, she changed the drift of her question. `How 
                did you manage? Have you weaned her yet?' </p>
              <p> But Anna had understood. </p>
              <p> `You didn't mean to ask that? You meant to ask about her surname. 
                Yes? That worries Alexei. She has no name - that is, she's a Karenina,' 
                said Anna, dropping her eyelids till nothing could be seen but 
                the eyelashes meeting. `But we'll talk about all that later,' 
                her face suddenly brightening. `Come, I'll show her to you. Elle 
                est tr¨¨s gentille. She crawls now.' </p>
              <p> In the nursery the luxury which had impressed Dolly in the whole 
                house struck her still more. There were little gocarts ordered 
                from England, and appliances for learning to walk, and a sofa 
                after the fashion of a billiard table, purposely constructed for 
                crawling, and swings, and baths, all of special pattern, and modern. 
                They were all English, solid, and of good make, and obviously 
                very expensive. The room was large, and very light and lofty. 
              </p>
              <p> When they went in, the baby, with nothing on but her little 
                smock, was sitting in a little elbowchair at the table, having 
                her dinner of broth, which she was spilling all over her little 
                chest. The baby was being fed, and the Russian nurserymaid was 
                evidently sharing her meal. Neither the wet nurse nor the head 
                nurse were there; they were in the next room, from which came 
                the sound of their conversation in the queer French which was 
                their only means of communication. </p>
              <p> Hearing Anna's voice, a smart, tall English nurse with a disagreeable 
                face and a dissolute expression walked in at the door, hurriedly 
                shaking her fair curls, and immediately began to defend herself 
                though Anna had not found fault with her. At every word Anna said 
                the English nurse said hurriedly several times, `Yes, my lady.' 
              </p>
              <p> The rosy baby with her black eyebrows and hair, her sturdy red 
                little body with tight goose-flesh skin, delighted Darya Alexandrovna 
                in spite of the cross expression with which she stared at the 
                stranger. She positively envied the baby's healthy appearance. 
                She was delighted, too, at the baby's crawling. Not one of her 
                own children had crawled like that. When the baby was put on the 
                carpet and its little dress tucked up behind, it was wonderfully 
                charming. Looking round like some little wild animal at the grown-up 
                big people with her bright black eyes, she smiled, unmistakably 
                pleased at their admiring her, and, holding her legs sideways, 
                she pressed vigorously on her arms, and rapidly drew her whole 
                back up after, and then made another step forward with her little 
                arms. </p>
              <p> But the whole atmosphere of the nursery, and especially the 
                English nurse, Darya Alexandrovna did not like at all. It was 
                only on the supposition that no good nurse would have entered 
                so irregular a household as Anna's that Darya Alexandrovna could 
                explain to herself how Anna with her insight into people could 
                take such an unprepossessing, indecorous woman as nurse to her 
                child. Besides, from a few words that were dropped, Darya Alexandrovna 
                saw at once that Anna, the two nurses, and the child, had no existence 
                in common, and that the mother's visit was something exceptional. 
                Anna wanted to get the baby her plaything, and could not find 
                it. </p>
              <p> Most amazing of all was the fact that on being asked how many 
                teeth the baby had, Anna answered wrong, and knew nothing about 
                the two last teeth. </p>
              <p> `I sometimes feel sorry I'm, as it were, superfluous here,' 
                said Anna, going out of the nursery, and holding up her skirt 
                so as to escape the plaything standing near the doorway. `It was 
                very different with my first child.' </p>
              <p> `I expected it to be the other way,' said Darya Alexandrovna 
                shyly. </p>
              <p> `Oh, no! By the way, do you know I saw Seriozha?' said Anna, 
                screwing up her eyes, as though looking at something far away. 
                `But we'll talk about that later. You wouldn't believe it, I'm 
                like a hungry beggar woman when a full dinner is set before her, 
                and she does not know what to begin on first. The full dinner 
                is you, and the talks I have before me with you, which I could 
                never have with anyone else; and I don't know which subject to 
                begin upon first. Mais je ne vous ferai grace de rien. I must 
                have everything out with you. Oh, I ought to give you a sketch 
                of the company you will meet with us,' she began. `I'll begin 
                with the ladies. Princess Varvara - you know her, and I know your 
                opinion and Stiva's about her. Stiva says the whole aim of her 
                existence is to prove her superiority over Auntie Katerina Pavlovna: 
                that's all true; but she's a good-natured woman, and I am so grateful 
                to her. In Peterburg there was a moment when un chaperon was absolutely 
                essential for me. Then she turned up. But, really, she is good-natured. 
                She did a great deal to alleviate my position. I see you don't 
                understand all the difficulty of my position... there in Peterburg,' 
                she added. `Here I'm perfectly at ease and happy. Well, of that 
                later on, though. Then Sviiazhsky - he's the marshal of the district, 
                and he's a very good sort of a man, but he wants to get something 
                out of Alexei. You understand, with his property, now that we 
                are settled in the country, Alexei can exercise great influence. 
                Then there's Tushkevich - you have seen him, you know - Betsy's 
                admirer. Now he's been thrown over, and he's come to see us. As 
                Alexei says, he's one of those people who are very pleasant if 
                one accepts them for what they try to appear to be, et puis, il 
                est comme il faut, as Princess Varvara says. Then Veslovsky... 
                you know him. A very charming boy,' she said, and a sly smile 
                curved her lips. `What's this wild story about him and the Levins? 
                Veslovsky told Alexei about it, and we don't believe it. Il est 
                tres gentil et na?f,' she said again with the same smile. `Men 
                need occupation, and Alexei needs a circle, so I value all these 
                people. We have to have the house lively and gay, so that Alexei 
                may not long for any novelty. Then you'll see the steward - a 
                German, a very good fellow, and he understands his work. Alexei 
                has a very high opinion of him. Then the doctor, a young man, 
                not quite a Nihilist perhaps, but, you know, he eats with his 
                knife... But a very good doctor. Then the architect... Une petite 
                cour.' </p>

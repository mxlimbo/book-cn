                `Now there is something I want to talk about, and you know what 
                it is... about Anna,' Stepan Arkadyevich said, pausing for a brief 
                space, and shaking off the unpleasant impression. </p>
              <p>As soon as Oblonsky uttered Anna's name, the face of Alexei Alexandrovich 
                became completely transformed; all the life went out of it, and 
                it looked weary and dead. </p>
              <p> `What is it exactly that you want from me?' he said, moving 
                in his chair and snapping his pince-nez. </p>
              <p> `A definite settlement, Alexei Alexandrovich - some settlement 
                of the situation. I'm appealing to you' (`not as to an injured 
                husband,' Stepan Arkadyevich was going to say, but, afraid of 
                wrecking his negotiation by this, he changed the words) `not as 
                to a statesman' (which did not sound apropos), `but simply as 
                to a man, and a goodhearted man, and a Christian. You must have 
                pity on her,' he said. </p>
              <p> `That is, in what way, precisely?' Karenin said softly. </p>
              <p> `Yes, pity on her. If you had seen her as I have! - I have been 
                spending all the winter with her - you would have pity on her. 
                Her position is awful, simply awful!' </p>
              <p> `I had imagined,' answered Alexei Alexandrovich in a higher, 
                almost shrill voice, `that Anna Arkadyevna had everything she 
                had desired for herself.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, Alexei Alexandrovich, for God's sake, let's not indulge 
                in recriminations! What is past is past, and you know what she 
                wants and is waiting for - a divorce.' </p>
              <p> `But I believe Anna Arkadyevna refuses a divorce, if I make 
                it a condition to leave me my son. I replied in that sense, and 
                supposed that the matter was ended. I consider it at an end,' 
                shrieked Alexei Alexandrovich. </p>
              <p> `But, for heaven's sake, don't get excited!' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                touching his brother-in-law's knee. `The matter is not ended. 
                If you will allow me to recapitulate, it was like this: when you 
                parted, you were as magnanimous as could possibly be; you were 
                ready to give her everything - freedom, even divorce. She appreciated 
                that. No, make no doubt. She did appreciate it - to such a degree 
                that, at the first moment, feeling how she had wronged you, she 
                did not consider and could not consider everything. She gave up 
                everything. But experience, time, have shown that her position 
                is unbearable, impossible.' </p>
              <p> `The life of Anna Arkadyevna can have no interest for me,' Alexei 
                Alexandrovich put in, raising his eyebrows. </p>
              <p> `Allow me to disbelieve that,' Stepan Arkadyevich replied gently. 
                `Her position is intolerable for her, and of no benefit to anyone 
                whatever. She has deserved it, you will say. She knows that and 
                asks you for nothing; she says plainly that she dare not ask you. 
                But I, all of us - her relatives, all who love her - beg you, 
                entreat you. Why should she suffer? Who is any the better for 
                it?' </p>
              <p> `Excuse me, you seem to put me in the position of the guilty 
                party,' observed Alexei Alexandrovich. </p>
              <p> `Oh, no, oh, no, not at all! Please understand me,' said Stepan 
                Arkadyevich again touching him - this time his hand - as though 
                feeling sure this physical contact would soften his brother-in-law. 
                `All I say is this: her position is intolerable, and it might 
                be alleviated by you, and you will lose nothing by it. I will 
                arrange it all for you, so that you'll never notice it. You did 
                promise it, you know.' </p>
              <p> `The promise was given before. And I had supposed that the question 
                of my son had settled the matter. Besides, I hoped that Anna Arkadyevna 
                had enough magnanimity...' Alexei Alexandrovich articulated with 
                difficulty, his lips twitching and his face white. </p>
              <p> `She leaves it all to your magnanimity. She begs, she implores 
                one thing of you - to extricate her from the impossible position 
                in which she is placed. She does not ask for her son now. Alexei 
                Alexandrovich, you are a good man. Put yourself in her position 
                for a minute. The question of divorce for her in her position 
                is a question of life and death. If you had not promised it once, 
                she would have reconciled herself to her position, she would have 
                gone on living in the country. But you promised it, and she wrote 
                to you, and moved to Moscow. And here she's been for six months 
                in Moscow, where every chance meeting cuts her to the heart, every 
                day expecting an answer. Why, it's like keeping a condemned criminal 
                for six months with the rope round his neck, promising him perhaps 
                death, perhaps mercy. Have pity on her, and I will undertake to 
                arrange everything.... Vos scrupules...' </p>
              <p> `I am not talking about that, about that...' Alexei Alexandrovich 
                interrupted with disgust. `But, perhaps, I promised what I had 
                no right to promise.' </p>
              <p> `So you go back on your promise?' </p>
              <p> `I have never refused to do all that is possible, but I want 
                time to consider how much of what I promised is possible.' </p>
              <p> `No, Alexei Alexandrovich!' cried Oblonsky, jumping up. `I won't 
                believe that! She's unhappy as only a woman can be unhappy, and 
                you cannot refuse in such...' </p>
              <p> `As much of what I promised as is possible. Vous professez d'¨ºtre 
                libre penseur. But I, as a believer, cannot, in a matter of such 
                gravity, act in opposition to the Christian law.' </p>
              <p> `But in Christian societies and among us, as far as I'm aware, 
                divorce is allowed,' said Stepan Arkadyevich. `Divorce is sanctioned 
                even by our church. And we see...' </p>
              <p> `It is allowed, but not in the sense...' </p>
              <p> `Alexei Alexandrovich, you are not like yourself,' said Oblonsky, 
                after a brief pause. `Wasn't it you (and didn't we all appreciate 
                it in you?) who forgave everything, and, moved simply by Christian 
                feeling, were ready to make any sacrifice? You said yourself: 
                if a man take thy cloak, give him thy coat also, and now...' </p>
              <p> `I beg,' said Alexei Alexandrovich shrilly, getting suddenly 
                onto his feet, his face white and his jaws twitching, `I beg you 
                to drop this... to drop... this subject!' </p>
              <p> `Oh, no! Oh, forgive me, forgive me if I have wounded you,' 
                said Stepan Arkadyevich, holding out his hand with a smile of 
                embarrassment; `but like a messenger I have simply performed the 
                commission given me.' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich gave him his hand, pondered a little, and 
                said: </p>
              <p> `I must think it over and seek for guidance. The day after tomorrow 
                I will give you a final answer,' he said, after considering a 
                moment. </p>

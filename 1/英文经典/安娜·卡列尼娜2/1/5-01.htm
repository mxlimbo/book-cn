              <p><br>
                Princess Shcherbatskaia considered that it was out of the question 
                for the wedding to take place before Lent, just five weeks off, 
                since not half the trousseau could possibly be ready by that time. 
                But she could not but agree with Levin that to fix it for after 
                Lent would be putting it off too late, as an old aunt of Prince 
                Shcherbatsky's was seriously ill and might die, and then the mourning 
                would delay the wedding still longer. And therefore, deciding 
                to divide the trousseau into two parts - a larger and a smaller 
                trousseau - the Princess consented to have the wedding before 
                Lent. She determined that she would get the smaller part of the 
                trousseau all ready now, and the larger part should be sent on 
                later, and she was much vexed with Levin because he was incapable 
                of giving her a serious answer to the question whether he agreed 
                to this arrangement or not. The arrangement was the more suitable 
                as, immediately after the wedding, the newly married couple were 
                to go to the country, where the belongings of the larger trousseau 
                would not be wanted. <br>
                Levin still continued in the same delirious condition, in which 
                it seemed to him that he and his happiness constituted the chief 
                and sole aim of all existence, and that he need not now think 
                or care about anything, that everything was being done and would 
                be done for him by others. He had not even plans and aims for 
                the future, he left its arrangement to others, knowing that everything 
                would be delightful. His brother, Sergei Ivanovich, and Stepan 
                Arkadyevich, and the Princess, guided him in doing what he had 
                to do. All he did was to agree entirely with everything suggested 
                to him. His brother raised money for him, the Princess advised 
                him to leave Moscow after the wedding. Stepan Arkadyevich advised 
                him to go abroad. He agreed to everything. `Do what you choose, 
                if it amuses you, I'm happy, and my happiness can be no greater 
                and no less because of anything you do,' he thought. When he told 
                Kitty of Stepan Arkadyevich's advice that they should go abroad, 
                he was much surprised that she did not agree to this, and had 
                some definite requirements of her own in regard to their future. 
                She knew Levin had work he loved in the country. She did not, 
                as he saw, understand this work - she did not even care to understand 
                it. But that did not prevent her from regarding it as a matter 
                of great importance. And therefore she knew their home would be 
                in the country, and she wanted to go not abroad where she was 
                not going to live, but to the place where their home would be. 
                This definitely expressed purpose astonished Levin. But since 
                he did not care either way, he immediately asked Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                as though it were his duty, to go down to the country and to arrange 
                everything there to the best of his ability, with that taste of 
                which he had so much. </p>
              <p> `But, I say,' Stepan Arkadyevich said to him one day after he 
                had come back from the country, where he had got everything ready 
                for the young people's arrival, `have you a certificate of having 
                been at confession?' </p>
              <p> `No. But what of it?' </p>
              <p> `You can't be married without it.' </p>
              <p> `My, my, my!' cried Levin. `Why, I believe it's nine years since 
                I've taken the sacrament! I never thought of it.' </p>
              <p> `You're a pretty fellow!' said Stepan Arkadyevich laughing, 
                `and you call me a Nihilist! But this won't do, you know. You 
                must take the sacrament.' </p>
              <p> `When? There are four days left now.' </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich arranged this also, and Levin had to prepare 
                himself for the sacrament. To Levin, as to any unbeliever who 
                respects the beliefs of others, it was exceedingly disagreeable 
                to be present at and to take part in church ceremonies. At this 
                moment, in his present softened state of feeling, sensitive to 
                everything, this inevitable act of hypocrisy was not merely painful 
                to Levin, it seemed to him utterly impossible. Now, in the heyday 
                of his highest glory, his fullest flower, he would have to be 
                a liar or a blasphemer. He felt incapable of being either. But 
                though he repeatedly plied Stepan Arkadyevich with questions as 
                to the possibility of obtaining a certificate without actually 
                communicating, Stepan Arkadyevich maintained that it was out of 
                the question. </p>
              <p> `Besides, what is it to you - two days? And he's an awfully 
                fine, clever old fellow. He'll pull the tooth out for you so gently 
                you won't notice it.' </p>
              <p> Standing at the first mass, Levin attempted to revive in himself 
                his youthful recollections of the intense religious emotion he 
                had passed through between the ages of sixteen and seventeen. 
                But he was at once convinced that it was utterly impossible to 
                him. He attempted to look at it all as an empty custom, having 
                no sort of meaning, like the custom of paying calls; but he felt 
                that he could not do that either. Levin found himself, like the 
                majority of his contemporaries, in the vaguest position in regard 
                to religion. Believe he could not, and at the same time he had 
                no firm conviction that it was all wrong. And consequently, not 
                being able to believe in the significance of what he was doing, 
                nor to regard it with indifference as an empty formality, during 
                the whole period of preparing for the sacrament he was conscious 
                of a feeling of discomfort and shame at doing what he did not 
                himself understand, and what, as an inner voice told him, was 
                therefore false and wrong. </p>
              <p> During the service he would first listen to the prayers, trying 
                to attach some meaning to them not discordant with his own views; 
                then feeling that he could not understand and must condemn them, 
                he tried not to listen to them, but to attend to the thoughts, 
                observations, and memories which floated through his brain with 
                extreme vividness during this idle time of standing in church. 
              </p>
              <p> He had stood through the mass, the evening service, and the 
                midnight service, and the next day he got up earlier than usual, 
                and, without having tea, went at eight o'clock in the morning 
                to the church for the morning service and the confession. </p>
              <p> There was no one in church but a beggar soldier, two old women, 
                and the churchmen. A young deacon, whose long back showed in two 
                distinct halves through his thin undercassock, met him, and, at 
                once going to a little table at the wall, read the exhortations. 
                During the reading, especially at the frequent and rapid repetition 
                of the same words, `Lord, have mercy on us!' which sounded like 
                `mercynuslor!' Levin felt that his thought was shut and sealed 
                up, and that it must not be touched or stirred now, or else confusion 
                would be the result; and so standing behind the deacon he went 
                on thinking of his own affairs, neither listening nor examining 
                what was said. `It's wonderful what expression there is in her 
                hand,' he thought, remembering how they had been sitting the day 
                before at a corner table. They had nothing to talk about, as was 
                almost always the case at this time, and laying her hand on the 
                table she kept opening and shutting it, and laughed herself as 
                she watched her action. He remembered how he had kissed her hand 
                and then had examined the lines on the pink palm. `Another ``mercynuslor!'' 
                thought Levin, crossing himself, bowing, and looking at the supple 
                spring of the deacon's back bowing before him. `She took my hand 
                then and examined the lines. ``You've got a splendid hand,' she 
                said.' And he looked at his own hand and the short hand of the 
                deacon. `Yes, now it will soon be over,' he thought. `No, it seems 
                to be starting up again,' he thought, listening to the prayers. 
                `No, it's just ending: there he is bowing down to the ground. 
                That's always at the end.' </p>
              <p> The deacon's hand in a plush cuff unobtrusively accepted a three-rouble 
                note, and the deacon said he would put Levin's name down in the 
                register, and, his new boots creaking jauntily over the flagstones 
                of the empty church, he went to the altar. A moment later he peeped 
                out thence and beckoned to Levin. Thought, till then locked up, 
                began to stir in Levin's head, but he made haste to drive it away. 
                `It will come right somehow,' he thought, and went toward the 
                ambo. He went up the steps, and turning to the right, saw the 
                priest. The priest, a little ancient with a scanty grizzled beard 
                and weary, good-natured eyes, was standing at the lectern, turning 
                over the pages of a missal. With a slight bow to Levin he began 
                immediately reading prayers in an accustomed voice. When he had 
                finished them he bowed down to the ground and turned, facing Levin. 
              </p>
              <p> `Christ is present here unseen, receiving your confession,' 
                he said, pointing to the crucifix. `Do you believe in all the 
                doctrines of the Holy Apostolic Church?' the priest went on, turning 
                his eyes away from Levin's face and folding his hands under his 
                stole. </p>
              <p> `I have doubted - I doubt everything,' said Levin in a voice 
                that jarred on himself, and he ceased speaking. </p>
              <p> The priest waited a few seconds to see if he would not say more, 
                and closing his eyes he said quickly, with a broad, Vladimirsky 
                accent: </p>
              <p> `Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind, but we must pray 
                that God in His mercy will strengthen us. What are your special 
                sins?' he added, without the slightest interval, as though anxious 
                not to waste time. </p>
              <p> `My chief sin is doubt. I have doubts of everything, and for 
                the most part I am in doubt.' </p>
              <p> `Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind,' the priest repeated 
                the same words. `What do you doubt about principally?' </p>
              <p> `I doubt everything. I sometimes even have doubts of the existence 
                of God,' Levin could not help saying, and he was horrified at 
                the impropriety of what he was saying. But Levin's words did not, 
                it seemed, make much impression on the priest. </p>
              <p> `What sort of doubt can there be of the existence of God?' he 
                said hurriedly, with a barely perceptible smile. </p>
              <p> Levin did not speak. </p>
              <p> `What doubt can you have of the Creator when you behold His 
                creation?' the priest went on in the rapid customary recitative. 
                `Who has decked the heavenly firmament with its lights? Who has 
                clothed the earth in its beauty? How explain it without the Creator?' 
                he said, looking inquiringly at Levin. </p>
              <p> Levin felt that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical 
                discussion with the priest, and so he said in reply merely what 
                was a direct answer to the question. </p>
              <p> `I don't know,' he said. </p>
              <p> `You don't know! Then how can you doubt that God created all?' 
                the priest said, with good-humored perplexity. </p>
              <p> `I don't understand it at all,' said Levin, blushing, and feeling 
                that his words were stupid, and that they could not be anything 
                but stupid in such a position. </p>
              <p> `Pray to God and beseech Him. Even the holy fathers had doubts, 
                and prayed to God to strengthen their faith. The devil has great 
                power, and we must resist him. Pray to God, beseech Him. Pray 
                to God,' he repeated hurriedly. </p>
              <p> The priest paused for some time, as though meditating. </p>
              <p> `You, I hear, are about to marry the daughter of my parishioner 
                and son in the spirit, Prince Shcherbatsky?' he resumed, with 
                a smile. `An excellent young lady.' </p>
              <p> `Yes,' answered Levin, blushing for the priest. `What does he 
                want to ask me about this at confession for?' he thought. </p>
              <p> And, as though answering his thought, the priest said to him: 
              </p>
              <p> `You are about to enter into holy matrimony, and God may bless 
                you with offspring. Are you? - Well, what sort of bringing-up 
                can you give your babes if you do not overcome the temptation 
                of the devil, enticing you to infidelity?' he said, with gentle 
                reproachfulness. `If you love your child as a good father, you 
                will not desire only wealth, luxury, honor for your infant; you 
                will be anxious for his salvation, his spiritual enlightenment 
                with the light of truth. Eh? What answer will you make him when 
                the innocent babe asks you: ``Papa! Who made all that enchants 
                me in this world - the earth, the waters, the sun, the flowers, 
                the grass?' Can you say to him: ``I don't know?' You cannot but 
                know, since the Lord God in His infinite mercy has revealed it 
                to us. Or your child will ask you: ``What awaits me in the life 
                beyond the grave?' What will you say to him when you know nothing? 
                How will you answer him? Will you leave him to the allurements 
                of the world and the devil? That's not right,' he said, and he 
                stopped, putting his head on one side and looking at Levin with 
                his kindly, gentle eyes. </p>
              <p> Levin made no answer this time, not because he did not want 
                to enter upon a discussion with the priest, but because no one 
                had ever asked him such questions - and when his babes did ask 
                him those questions, it would be time enough to think about answering 
                them. </p>
              <p> `You are entering upon a time of life,' pursued the priest, 
                `when you must choose your path and keep to it. Pray to God that 
                He may in His mercy aid you and have mercy on you!' he concluded. 
                `Our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, in the abundance and riches of 
                His loving-kindness, forgives this child...' and, finishing the 
                prayer of absolution, the priest blessed him and dismissed him. 
              </p>
              <p> On getting home that day, Levin had a delightful sense of relief 
                at the awkward position being over and having been got through 
                without his having to tell a lie. Apart from this, there remained 
                a vague memory that what the kind, fine old fellow had said had 
                not been at all as stupid as he had fancied at first, and that 
                there was something in it that must be cleared up. </p>
              <p> `Of course, not now,' thought Levin, `but at some later day.' 
                Levin felt more than ever now that there was something not clear 
                and not clean in his soul, and that, in regard to religion, he 
                was in the same position which he perceived so clearly and disliked 
                in others, and for which he blamed his friend Sviiazhsky. </p>
              <p> Levin spent that evening with his betrothed at Dolly's, and 
                was in very high spirits. To explain to Stepan Arkadyevich the 
                state of excitement in which he found himself, he said that he 
                was happy, like a dog being trained to jump through a hoop, who, 
                having at last caught the idea, and done what was required of 
                him, whines and wags its tail, and jumps up to the table and the 
                window sills in its delight. </p>

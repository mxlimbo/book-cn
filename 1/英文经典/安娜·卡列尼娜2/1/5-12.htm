                Anna and Vronsky had long been exchanging glances, regretting 
                their friend's flow of cleverness. At last Vronsky, without waiting 
                for the artist, walked away to another small picture. </p>
              <p>`Oh, how exquisite! What a lovely thing! A gem! How exquisite!' 
                they cried with one voice. </p>
              <p> `What is it they're so pleased with?' thought Mikhailov. He 
                had positively forgotten that picture he had painted three years 
                ago. He had forgotten all the agonies and the ecstasies he had 
                lived through with that picture when, for several months, it had 
                been the one thought haunting him day and night. He had forgotten, 
                as he always forgot, the pictures he had finished. He did not 
                even like to look at it, and had only brought it out because he 
                was expecting an Englishman who wanted to buy it. </p>
              <p> `Oh, that's only an old study,' he said. </p>
              <p> `How fine!' said Golenishchev, he too, with unmistakable sincerity, 
                falling under the spell of the picture. </p>
              <p> Two boys were angling in the shade of a willow tree. The elder 
                had just dropped in the hook, and was carefully pulling the float 
                from behind a bush, entirely absorbed in what he was doing. The 
                other, a little younger, was lying in the grass leaning on his 
                elbows, with his tangled, flaxen head in his hands, staring at 
                the water with his dreamy blue eyes. What was he thinking of? 
              </p>
              <p> The enthusiasm over this picture stirred some of the old feeling 
                for it in Mikhailov, but he feared and disliked this waste of 
                feeling for things past, and so, even though this praise was grateful 
                to him, he tried to draw his visitors away to a third picture. 
              </p>
              <p> But Vronsky asked whether the picture was for sale? To Mikhailov 
                at that moment, excited by visitors, it was extremely distasteful 
                to speak of money matters. </p>
              <p> `It is put up there to be sold,' he answered, scowling gloomily. 
              </p>
              <p> When the visitors had gone, Mikhailov sat down opposite the 
                picture of Pilate and Christ, and in his mind went over what had 
                been said, and what, though not said, had been implied by those 
                visitors. And, strange to say, what had had such weight with him, 
                while they were there and while he mentally put himself at their 
                point of view, suddenly lost all importance for him. He began 
                to look at his picture with all his own full, artist's vision, 
                and was soon in that mood of conviction of the perfectibility, 
                and so of the significance, of his picture - a conviction essential 
                to the intensest fervor, excluding all other interests - in which 
                alone he could work. </p>
              <p> Christ's foreshortened leg was not right, though. He took his 
                palette and began to work. As he corrected the leg he looked continually 
                at the figure of John in the background, which his visitors had 
                not even noticed, but which he knew was beyond perfection. When 
                he had finished the leg he wanted to touch that figure, but he 
                felt too much excited for that. He was equally unable to work 
                when he was cold and when he was too much affected and saw everything 
                too clearly. There was only one stage in the transition from coldness 
                to inspiration, at which work was possible. Today he was too much 
                agitated. He would have covered the picture, but he stopped, holding 
                the cloth in his hand, and, smiling blissfully, gazed a long while 
                at the figure of John. At last, tearing himself away with evident 
                regret, he dropped the cloth, and, exhausted but happy, went home. 
              </p>
              <p> Vronsky, Anna, and Golenishchev, on their way home, were particularly 
                lively and cheerful. They talked of Mikhailov and his pictures. 
                The word talent, by which they meant an inborn, almost physical, 
                aptitude apart from brain and heart, and in which they tried to 
                find an expression for all the artist had gained from life, recurred 
                particularly often in their talk, as though it were necessary 
                for them to sum up what they had no conception of, though they 
                wanted to talk of it. They said that there was no denying his 
                talent, but that his talent could not develop for want of education 
                - the common defect of our Russian artists. But the picture of 
                the boys had imprinted itself on their memories, and they were 
                continually coming back to it. `What an exquisite thing! How he 
                has succeeded in it, and how simply! He doesn't even comprehend 
                how good it is. Yes, I mustn't let it slip; I must buy it,' said 
                Vronsky. </p>

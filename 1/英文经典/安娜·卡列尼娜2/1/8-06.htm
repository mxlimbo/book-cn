                Sergei Ivanovich had not telegraphed to his brother to send to 
                meet him, as he did not know when he should be able to leave Moscow. 
                Levin was not at home when Katavassov and Sergei Ivanovich, in 
                a wagonette hired at the station, drove up to the steps of the 
                Pokrovskoe house, as black as Negroes from the dust of the road. 
                Kitty, sitting on the balcony with her father and sister, recognized 
                her brother-in-law, and ran down to meet him. </p>
              <p>`What a shame not to have let us know,' she said, giving her 
                hand to Sergei Ivanovich, and putting her forehead up for him 
                to kiss. </p>
              <p> `We drove here capitally, and have not put you out,' answered 
                Sergei Ivanovich. `I'm so dirty. I'm afraid to touch you. I've 
                been so busy, I didn't know when I should be able to tear myself 
                away. And so you're still as ever enjoying your peaceful, quiet 
                happiness,' he said, smiling, `out of the reach of the current 
                in your peaceful backwater. Here's our friend Fiodor Vassilievich, 
                successful in getting here at last.' </p>
              <p> `But I'm not a Negro; I shall look like a human being when I 
                wash,' said Katavassov in his jesting fashion, and he shook hands 
                and smiled, his teeth flashing white in his black face. </p>
              <p> `Kostia will be delighted. He has gone to his grange. It's time 
                he should be home.' </p>
              <p> `Busy as ever with his farming. It really is a peaceful backwater,' 
                said Katavassov; `while we in town think of nothing but the Servian 
                war. Well, how does our friend look at it? He's sure not to think 
                like other people.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, I don't know, he's like everybody else,' Kitty answered, 
                a little embarrassed, looking round at Sergei Ivanovich. `I'll 
                send to fetch him. Papa's staying with us. He's only just come 
                home from abroad.' </p>
              <p> And making arrangements to send for Levin and for the guests 
                to wash, one in his room and the other in what had been Dolly's, 
                and giving orders for their luncheon, Kitty ran out on the balcony, 
                enjoying the freedom and rapidity of movement, of which she had 
                been deprived during the months of her pregnancy. </p>
              <p> `It's Sergei Ivanovich and Katavassov, a professor,' she said. 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, it's hard in such a heat,' said the Prince. </p>
              <p> `No, papa, he's very nice, and Kostia's very fond of him,' Kitty 
                said, with a deprecating smile, noticing the irony on her father's 
                face. </p>
              <p> `Oh, I didn't say anything.' </p>
              <p> `You go to them, darling,' said Kitty to her sister, `and entertain 
                them. They saw Stiva at the station; he was quite well. And I 
                must run to Mitia. As ill luck would have it, I haven't fed him 
                since tea. He's awake now, and sure to be screaming.' And, feeling 
                a rush of milk, she hurried to the nursery. </p>
              <p> This was not a mere guess; her connection with the child was 
                still so close that she could gauge by the flow of her milk his 
                need of food, and knew for certain he was hungry. </p>
              <p> She knew he was crying before she reached the nursery. And he 
                was indeed crying. She heard him and hastened. But the faster 
                she went the louder he screamed. It was a fine healthy scream, 
                hungry and impatient. </p>
              <p> `Has he been screaming long, nurse - very long?' said Kitty, 
                hurriedly seating herself on a chair, and preparing to give the 
                baby the breast. `But give me him quickly. Oh, nurse, how tiresome 
                you are! There, tie the cap afterward, do!' </p>
              <p> The baby's greedy scream was passing into sobs. </p>
              <p> `But you can't manage so, ma'am,' said Agathya Mikhailovna, 
                who was almost always to be found in the nursery. `He must be 
                put straight. A-oo! A-oo!' she chanted over him, paying no attention 
                to the mother. </p>
              <p> The nurse brought the baby to his mother. Agathya Mikhailovna 
                followed him with a face melting with tenderness. </p>
              <p> `He knows me, he knows me. In God's faith, Katerina Alexandrovna, 
                ma'am, he recognized me!' Agathya Mikhailovna cried above the 
                baby's screams. </p>
              <p> But Kitty did not hear her words. Her impatience kept growing, 
                like the baby's. </p>
              <p> Their impatience hindered things for a while. The baby could 
                not get hold of the breast right, and was furious. </p>
              <p> At last, after despairing, breathless screaming, and vain sucking, 
                things went right, and mother and child felt simultaneously soothed, 
                and both subsided into calm. </p>
              <p> `But poor darling, he's all in perspiration!' said Kitty in 
                a whisper, touching the baby. `What makes you think he knows you?' 
                she added, with a sidelong glance at the baby's eyes, that peered 
                roguishly, as she fancied, from under his cap, at his rhythmically 
                puffing cheeks, and the little red-palmed hand he was waving. 
              </p>
              <p> `Impossible! If he knew anyone, he would have known me,' said 
                Kitty, in response to Agathya Mikhailovna's statement, and she 
                smiled. </p>
              <p> She smiled because, though she said he could not know her, in 
                her heart she was sure that he knew not merely Agathya Mikhailovna, 
                but that he knew and understood everything, and knew and understood 
                a great deal too that no one else knew, and that she, his mother, 
                had learned and come to understand only through him. To Agathya 
                Mikhailovna, to the nurse, to his grandfather, to his father even, 
                Mitia was a living being, requiring only material care, but for 
                his mother he had long been a moral being, with whom there had 
                been a whole series of spiritual relations already. </p>
              <p> `When he wakes up, please God, you shall see for yourself. Then 
                when I do like this, he simply beams on me, the darling! Simply 
                beams like a sunny day!' said Agathya Mikhailovna. </p>
              <p> `Well, well; then we shall see,' whispered Kitty. `But now go 
                away, he's going to sleep.' </p>

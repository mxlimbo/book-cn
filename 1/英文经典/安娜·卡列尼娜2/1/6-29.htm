              <p><br>
                The narrow room, in which they were smoking and taking refreshment, 
                was full of noblemen. The excitement grew more intense, and every 
                face betrayed some uneasiness. The excitement was specially keen 
                for the leaders of each party, who knew every detail, and had 
                reckoned up every vote. They were the generals organizing the 
                approaching battle. The rest, like the rank and file before an 
                engagement, though they were getting ready for the fight, sought 
                for other distractions in the interval. Some were lunching, standing 
                at the bar, or sitting at the table; others were walking up and 
                down the long room, smoking cigarettes, and talking with friends 
                whom they had not seen for a long while. <br>
                Levin did not care to eat, and he was not a smoker; he did not 
                want to join his own friends - that is Sergei Ivanovich, Stepan 
                Arkadyevich, Sviiazhsky, and the rest, because Vronsky in his 
                equerry's uniform was standing with them in eager conversation. 
                Levin had seen him already at the meeting on the previous day, 
                and he had studiously avoided him, not caring to greet him. He 
                went to the window and sat down, scanning the groups, and listening 
                to what was being said around him. He felt depressed, especially 
                because everyone else was, as he saw, eager, anxious, and interested, 
                and he alone, with an old, toothless little man with mumbling 
                lips, wearing a naval uniform who sat beside him, had no interest 
                in it, and nothing to do. </p>
              <p> `He's such a blackguard! I have told him so, but it makes no 
                difference. Only think of it! He couldn't collect it in three 
                years!' he heard vigorously uttered by a stoop-shouldered, short 
                country gentleman, who had pomaded hair hanging over his embroidered 
                collar, and new boots obviously put on for the occasion, with 
                heels that tapped energetically as he spoke. Casting a displeased 
                glance at Levin, this gentleman sharply turned his back. </p>
              <p> `Yes, it's a dirty business, there's no denying,' another puny 
                landowner assented in a high voice. </p>
              <p> Next, a whole crowd of country gentlemen, surrounding a stout 
                general, hurriedly came near Levin. These persons were unmistakably 
                seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard. 
              </p>
              <p> `How dare he say I had his breeches stolen! Pawned them for 
                drink, I expect. Damn the fellow - Prince indeed! He'd better 
                not say it - that's swinish!' </p>
              <p> `But excuse me! They take their stand on the act,' was being 
                said in another group; `the wife must be registered as a noble.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, damn your acts! I speak from my heart. We're all gentlemen, 
                aren't we? Have trust in us.' </p>
              <p> `Shall we go on, Your Excellency - fine champagne?' </p>
              <p> Another group was following a nobleman who was shouting something 
                in a loud voice; it was one of the three intoxicated gentlemen. 
              </p>
              <p> `I always advised Marya Semionovna to let for a fair rent, for 
                she can never save a profit,' he heard a pleasant voice say. The 
                speaker was a country gentleman with white mustache, wearing the 
                regimental uniform of an old general staff officer. It was the 
                very landowner Levin had met at Sviiazhsky's. He knew him at once. 
                The landowner too stared at Levin, and they exchanged greetings. 
              </p>
              <p> `Very glad to see you! To be sure! I remember you very well. 
                Last year at our district marshal's, Nikolai Ivanovich's.' </p>
              <p> `Well, and how is your land doing?' asked Levin. </p>
              <p> `Oh, still just the same, always at a loss,' the landowner answered 
                with a resigned smile, but with an expression of serenity and 
                conviction that it must be thus. `And how do you come to be in 
                our province?' he asked. `Come to take part in our coup d'¨¦tat?' 
                he said, confidently pronouncing the French words with a bad accent. 
              </p>
              <p> `All Russia's here - gentlemen of the bedchamber, and everything 
                short of the ministry.' He pointed to the imposing figure of Stepan 
                Arkadyevich in white trousers and his court uniform, walking by 
                with a general. </p>
              <p> `I ought to own that I don't very well understand the drift 
                of the provincial elections,' said Levin. </p>
              <p> The landowner looked at him. </p>
              <p> `Why, what is there to understand? There's no meaning in it 
                at all. It's a decaying institution that goes on running only 
                by the force of inertia. Just look, the very uniforms tell you 
                that it's an assembly of justices of the peace, permanent members 
                of the boards, and so on, but not of noblemen.' </p>
              <p> `Then why do you come?' asked Levin. </p>
              <p> `From habit, nothing else. Then, too, one must keep up connections. 
                It's a moral obligation of a sort. And then, to tell the truth, 
                there are one's own interests. My son-in-law wants to run as a 
                permanent member; they're not rich people, and he must be brought 
                forward. These gentlemen, now - what do they come for?' he said, 
                pointing to the venomous gentleman, who was talking at the high 
                table. </p>
              <p> `That's the new generation of nobility.' </p>
              <p> `New it may be, but nobility it isn't. They're landed proprietors 
                - but we're the landowners. As noblemen, they're cutting their 
                own throats.' </p>
              <p> `But you say it's an institution that's served its time.' </p>
              <p> `That it may be, but still, it ought to be treated a little 
                more respectfully. Snetkov, now... We may be of use, or we may 
                not, but we're the growth of a thousand years. If we're laying 
                out a garden, planning one before the house, you know, and there 
                you've a tree that's stood for centuries in the very spot... Old 
                and gnarled it may be, and yet you don't cut down the old fellow 
                to make room for the flowerbeds, but lay out your beds so as to 
                take advantage of the tree. You won't grow him again in a year,' 
                he said cautiously, and he immediately changed the conversation. 
                `Well, and how is your estate doing?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, not very well. I make about five per cent.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, but you don't reckon your own work. Aren't you worth something 
                too? I'll tell you my own case. Before I took to seeing after 
                the land, I had a salary of three thousand roubles from the service. 
                Now I do more work than I did in the service, and, like you, I 
                get five per cent on the land, and thank God for that. But one's 
                work is thrown in for nothing.' </p>
              <p> `Then why do you do it, if it's a clear loss?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, well, one does it! What would you have? It's habit, and 
                one knows it's as it should be. And what's more,' the landowner 
                went on, leaning on the window and chatting on, `my son, I must 
                tell you, has no taste for it. There's no doubt he'll be a savant. 
                So there'll be no one to keep it up. And yet one does it. Here 
                this year I've planted an orchard.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes,' said Levin, `that's perfectly true. I always feel 
                there's no real balance of gain in my work on the land, and yet 
                one does it.... It's a sort of duty one feels to the land.' </p>
              <p> `But I tell you what,' the landowner pursued; `a neighbor of 
                mine, a merchant, was at my place. We walked about the fields 
                and the park. ``No,' said he, ``Stepan Vassilyevich - everything's 
                well looked after but your garden's neglected.' But, as a fact, 
                it's well kept up. ``To my thinking, I'd cut down the linden trees. 
                Only do it when they're running sap. Here's a thousand lindens, 
                and each would make two good bundles of bast. And nowadays that 
                bast's worth something. And you'd cut down the lot of the linden 
                shells.'' </p>
              <p> `And with what he made he'd buy up livestock, or buy some land 
                for a trifle, and let it out to the peasants,' Levin added, smiling. 
                He had evidently more than once come across those commercial calculations. 
                `And he'd make his fortune. But you and I must thank God if we 
                keep what we've got and leave it to our children.' </p>
              <p> `You're married, I've heard?' said the landowner. </p>
              <p> `Yes,' Levin answered, with proud satisfaction. `Yes, all this 
                is rather strange,' he went on. `So we live on without any reckoning, 
                as though we were the vestals of antiquity, set to guard a sacred 
                fire or something.' </p>
              <p> The landowner chuckled under his white mustaches. </p>
              <p> `There are some among us, too, like our friend Nikolai Ivanovich, 
                or Count Vronsky, who's settled here lately - they try to set 
                up an agronomic industry; but so far it leads to nothing but making 
                away with capital.' </p>
              <p> `But why is it we don't do like the merchants? Why don't we 
                cut down our parks for bast?' said Levin, returning to a thought 
                that had struck him. </p>
              <p> `Why, as you said, to guard the fire. Besides, that's not work 
                for a nobleman. And our work as noblemen isn't done here at the 
                elections, but yonder, each in his own nook. There's a class instinct, 
                too, of what one ought and oughtn't to do. There are the peasants, 
                too - I wonder at them sometimes; any good peasant tries to take 
                all the land he can. However bad the land is, he'll work it. Without 
                a reckoning too. At a simple loss.' </p>
              <p> `Just as we do,' said Levin. `Very, very glad to have met you,' 
                he added, seeing Sviiazhsky approaching him. </p>
              <p> `And here we've met for the first time since we met at your 
                place,' said the landowner to Sviiazhsky, `and we've had a good 
                talk, too.' </p>
              <p> `Well, have you been attacking the new order of things?' said 
                Sviiazhsky with a smile. </p>
              <p> `That we're bound to do.' </p>
              <p> `You've been relieving your feelings.' </p>

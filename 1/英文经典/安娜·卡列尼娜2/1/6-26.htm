              <p><br>
                In September Levin moved to Moscow for Kitty's confinement. He 
                had spent a whole month in Moscow with nothing to do, when Sergei 
                Ivanovich, who had property in the Kashinsky province, and took 
                great interest in the question of the approaching elections, made 
                ready to set off to the elections. He invited his brother, who 
                had a vote in the Selezniovsky district, to come with him. Levin 
                had, moreover, to transact in Kashin some extremely important 
                business relating to the wardship, and to the receiving of certain 
                redemption money for his sister, who was abroad. </p>
              <p>Levin still hesitated, but Kitty, who saw that he was bored in 
                Moscow, and urged him to go, on her own authority ordered him 
                the proper nobleman's uniform, costing eighty roubles. And this 
                eighty roubles paid for the uniform was the chief reason that 
                finally decided Levin to go. He went to Kashin. </p>
              <p> Levin had been five days in Kashin, visiting the assembly each 
                day, and busily engaged about his sister's business, which still 
                dragged on. The district marshals of nobility were all occupied 
                with the elections, and it was impossible to get the simplest 
                thing done that depended upon the court of wardship. The other 
                matter, the receipt of the sums due, was also met by difficulties. 
                After long negotiations over the lifting of the prohibition, the 
                money was at last ready to be paid; but the notary, a most obliging 
                person, could not hand over the order, because it must have the 
                signature of the president, and the president, though he had not 
                given over his duties to a deputy, was at the elections. All these 
                worrying negotiations, this endless going from place to place, 
                and talking with pleasant and excellent people, who quite saw 
                the unpleasantness of the petitioner's position, but were powerless 
                to assist him - all these efforts that yielded no result, led 
                to a feeling of misery in Levin akin to the mortifying helplessness 
                one experiences in dreams, when one tries to use physical force. 
                He felt this frequently as he talked to his exceedingly good-natured 
                solicitor. This solicitor did, it seemed, everything possible, 
                and strained every nerve to get him out of his difficulties. `I 
                tell you what you might try,' he said more than once; `go to so-and-so 
                and so-and-so,' and the solicitor drew up a regular plan for getting 
                round the fatal point that hindered everything. But he would add 
                immediately, `It'll mean some delay, anyway, but you might try 
                it.' And Levin did try, and did go. Everyone was kind and civil, 
                but the point evaded seemed to crop up again in the end, and again 
                to bar the way. What was particularly trying, was that Levin could 
                not make out with whom he was struggling, to whose interest it 
                was that his business should not be done. That no one seemed to 
                know; the solicitor certainly did not know. If Levin could have 
                understood why, just as he saw why one can only approach the booking 
                office of a railway station in single file, it would not have 
                been so vexatious and tiresome to him. But in the case of the 
                hindrances that confronted him in his business, no one could explain 
                why they existed. </p>
              <p> But Levin had changed a good deal since his marriage; he was 
                patient, and if he could not see why it was all arranged like 
                this, he told himself that he could not judge without knowing 
                all about it, and that most likely it must be so, and he tried 
                not to resent it. </p>
              <p> In attending the elections, too, and taking part in them, he 
                tried now not to judge, not to fall foul of them, but to comprehend 
                as fully as he could the question which was so earnestly and ardently 
                absorbing honest and excellent men whom he respected. Since his 
                marriage there had been revealed to Levin so many new and serious 
                aspects of life which had previously, through his frivolous attitude 
                to them, seemed of no importance, that in the question of the 
                elections, too, he assumed and tried to find some serious significance. 
              </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich explained to him the meaning and object of 
                the proposed radical change at the elections. The marshal of the 
                province in whose hands the law had placed the control of so many 
                important public functions - the guardianship of wards (the very 
                department which was giving Levin so much trouble just now), the 
                disposal of large sums subscribed by the nobility of the province, 
                the high schools, for girls, for boys, and military, and primary 
                instruction on the new statute and finally, the Zemstvo - the 
                marshal of the province, Snetkov, was a nobleman of the old school, 
                dissipating an immense fortune, a goodhearted man, honest after 
                his own fashion, but utterly without any comprehension of the 
                needs of modern days. He always took, in every question, the side 
                of the nobility; he was positively antagonistic to the spread 
                of primary education, and he succeeded in giving a purely party 
                character to the Zemstvo which ought by rights to be of such an 
                immense importance. What was needed was to put in his place a 
                fresh, capable, perfectly modern man, of contemporary ideas, and 
                to frame their policy so as to derive, from the rights conferred 
                upon the nobles (not as the nobility, but as an element of the 
                Zemstvo), all the benefits of self-government that could possibly 
                be derived from them. In the wealthy Kashinsky province, which 
                always took the lead of other provinces in everything, there was 
                now such a preponderance of forces that this policy, once carried 
                through properly there, might serve as a model for other provinces 
                - for all Russia. And hence the whole question was of the greatest 
                importance. It was proposed to elect as marshal in place of Snetkov 
                either Sviiazhsky, or, better still, Neviedovsky, a former university 
                professor, a man of remarkable intelligence, and a great friend 
                of Sergei Ivanovich. </p>
              <p> The meeting was opened by the governor, who made a speech to 
                the nobles, urging them to elect the public functionaries, not 
                from regard for persons, but for the service and welfare of the 
                native country, and hoping that the honorable nobility of the 
                Kashinsky province would, as at all former elections, hold their 
                duty as sacred, and vindicate the exalted confidence of the Monarch. 
              </p>
              <p> When he had finished his speech, the governor walked out of 
                the hall, and the noblemen noisily and eagerly - some even enthusiastically 
                - followed him and thronged round him while he put on his fur 
                coat and conversed amicably with the marshal of the province. 
                Levin, anxious to see into everything and not miss anything, also 
                stood there in the crowd, and heard the governor say: `Please, 
                tell Marya Ivanovna my wife is very sorry she could not visit 
                the charity school.' And thereupon the nobles in high good humor 
                sorted out their fur coats and all drove off to the cathedral. 
              </p>
              <p> In the cathedral Levin, lifting his hand like the rest, and 
                repeating the words of the dean, vowed with the most awesome oaths 
                to do all the governor had hoped they would do. Church services 
                always affected Levin, and as he uttered the words: `I kiss the 
                cross,' and glanced round at the crowd of young and old men repeating 
                the same, he felt touched. </p>
              <p> On the second and third days there was business relating to 
                the finances of the nobility, and the high school for girls, of 
                no importance whatever, as Sergei Ivanovich explained, and Levin, 
                busy seeing after his own affairs, did not attend the meetings. 
                On the fourth day the auditing of the marshal's accounts took 
                place at the high table of the marshal of the province. And then 
                there occurred the first skirmish between the new party and the 
                old. The committee which had been deputed to verify the accounts 
                reported to the meeting that all was in order. The marshal of 
                the province got up, thanked the nobility for their confidence, 
                and shed tears. The nobles gave him a loud welcome and shook hands 
                with him. But at that instant a nobleman of Sergei Ivanovich's 
                party said that he had heard that the committee had not verified 
                the accounts, considering such a verification an insult to the 
                marshal of the province. One of the members of the committee incautiously 
                admitted this. Then a small gentleman, very young-looking but 
                very venomous, began to say that it would probably be agreeable 
                to the marshal of the province to give an account of his expenditures 
                of the public moneys, and that the misplaced delicacy of the members 
                of the committee was depriving him of this moral satisfaction. 
                Then the members of the committee tried to withdraw their admission, 
                and Sergei Ivanovich began to prove that they must logically admit 
                either that they had verified the accounts or that they had not, 
                and he developed this dilemma in detail. Sergei Ivanovich was 
                answered by the talker of the opposite party. Then Sviiazhsky 
                spoke, and then the venomous gentleman again. The discussion lasted 
                a long time and ended in nothing. Levin was surprised that they 
                should dispute upon this subject so long, especially as, when 
                he asked Sergei Ivanovich whether he supposed that money had been 
                misappropriated, Sergei Ivanovich answered: </p>
              <p> `Oh, no! He's an honest man. But those old-fashioned methods 
                of paternal family arrangements in the management of nobility 
                affairs must be broken down.' </p>
              <p> On the fifth day came the elections of the district marshals. 
                It was rather a stormy day in several districts. In the Selezniovsky 
                district Sviiazhsky was elected unanimously without a ballot, 
                and he gave a dinner that evening. </p>

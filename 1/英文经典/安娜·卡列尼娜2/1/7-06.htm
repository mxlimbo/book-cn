                `Perhaps they're not at home?' said Levin, as he went into the 
                hall of Countess Bol's house. <br>
                `At home; please walk in,' said the porter, resolutely removing 
                his overcoat. </p>
              <p> `How annoying!' thought Levin with a sigh, taking off one glove 
                and stroking his hat. `What did I come for? What have I to say 
                to them?' </p>
              <p> As he passed through the first drawing room Levin met in the 
                doorway Countess Bol, with a careworn and severe face, giving 
                some order to a servant. On seeing Levin she smiled, and asked 
                him to come into the next little drawing room where he heard voices. 
                In this room there were sitting in armchairs the two daughters 
                of the Countess, and a Moscow colonel, whom Levin knew. Levin 
                walked up, greeted them, and sat down beside the sofa, with his 
                hat on his knees. </p>
              <p> `How is your wife? Have you been at the concert? We couldn't 
                go. Mamma had to be at the requiem.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, I heard.... What a sudden death!' said Levin. </p>
              <p> The Countess came in, sat down on the sofa, and she too asked 
                after his wife and inquired about the concert. </p>
              <p> Levin answered, and repeated an inquiry about Madame Apraksina's 
                sudden death. </p>
              <p> `But she was always in poor health.' </p>
              <p> `Were you at the opera yesterday?' </p>
              <p> `Yes, I was.' </p>
              <p> `Lucca was very good.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, very good,' he said, and, as it was utterly of no consequence 
                to him what they thought of him, he began repeating what they 
                had heard a hundred times about the characteristics of the singer's 
                talent. Countess Bol pretended to be listening. Then, when he 
                had said enough and had paused, the colonel, who had been silent 
                till then, began to talk. The colonel too talked of the opera 
                and illumination. At last, after speaking of the proposed folle 
                journ¨¦e at Turin's, the colonel laughed, got up noisily, and went 
                away. Levin too rose, but he saw by the face of the Countess that 
                it was not yet time for him to go. He must stay two minutes longer. 
                He sat down. </p>
              <p> But as he was thinking all the while how stupid it was, he could 
                not find a subject for conversation, and sat silent. </p>
              <p> `You are not going to the public meeting? They say it will be 
                very interesting,' began the Countess. </p>
              <p> `No, I promised my belle-soeur to fetch her from it,' said Levin. 
              </p>
              <p> A silence followed. The mother once more exchanged glances with 
                one of the daughters. </p>
              <p> `Well, now I think the time has come,' thought Levin, and he 
                got up. The ladies shook hands with him, and begged him to say 
                mille choses to his wife for them. </p>
              <p> The porter asked him, as he gave him his coat: `Where is Your 
                Honor staying?' and immediately wrote down his address in a big 
                handsomely bound book. </p>
              <p> `Of course I don't care, but still I feel ashamed and awfully 
                stupid,' thought Levin, consoling himself with the reflection 
                that everyone does it. He drove to the public meeting, where he 
                was to find his sister-in-law, so as to drive home with her. </p>
              <p> At the public meeting of the committee there were a great many 
                people, and almost all the highest society. Levin was in time 
                for the report which, as everyone said, was very interesting. 
                When the reading of the report was over, people moved about, and 
                Levin met Sviiazhsky, who invited him very pressingly to come 
                that evening to a meeting of the Society of Agriculture, where 
                a celebrated report was to be delivered, and Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                who had only just come from the races, and many other acquaintances; 
                and Levin heard and uttered various criticisms on the meeting, 
                on the new play, and on a public trial. But, probably from the 
                mental fatigue he was beginning to feel, he made a blunder in 
                speaking of the trial, and this blunder he recalled several times 
                with vexation. Speaking of the sentence upon a foreigner who had 
                been condemned in Russia, and of how unfair it would be to punish 
                him by exile abroad, Levin repeated what he had heard the day 
                before in conversation from an acquaintance. </p>
              <p> `I think sending him abroad is much the same as punishing a 
                carp by putting it into the water,' said Levin. Then he recollected 
                that this idea, which he had heard from an acquaintance and uttered 
                as his own, came from a fable of Krilov's, and that the acquaintance 
                had picked it up from a newspaper article. </p>
              <p> After driving home with his sister-in-law, and finding Kitty 
                in good spirits and quite well, Levin drove to the club. </p>

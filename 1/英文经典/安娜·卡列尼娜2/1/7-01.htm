              <p><br>
                The Levins had been two months in Moscow. The date had long passed 
                on which, according to the most trustworthy calculations of people 
                learned in such matters, Kitty should have been confined. But 
                she was still about, and there was nothing to show that her time 
                was any nearer than two months ago. The doctor, the midwife, and 
                Dolly and her mother, and most of all Levin, who could not think 
                of the approaching event without terror, began to be impatient 
                and uneasy. Kitty was the only person who felt perfectly calm 
                and happy. </p>
              <p>She was distinctly conscious now of the birth of a new feeling 
                of love for the future child, for her to some extent actually 
                existing already, and she brooded blissfully over this feeling. 
                He was not by now altogether a part of herself, but sometimes 
                lived his own life independently of her. Often this separate being 
                gave her pain, but at the same time she wanted to laugh with a 
                strange new joy. </p>
              <p> All the people she loved were with her, and all were so good 
                to her, so attentively looking out for her, so entirely pleasant 
                was everything presented to her, that if she had not known and 
                felt that it must all soon be over, she could not have wished 
                for a better and pleasanter life. The only thing that spoiled 
                the charm of this mode of life was that here her husband was not 
                as she loved him to be, and as he was in the country. </p>
              <p> She liked his serene, friendly, and hospitable manner in the 
                country. In the town he seemed continually uneasy and on his guard, 
                as though he were afraid someone would be rude to him, and, still 
                more, to her. At home in the country, definitely knowing himself 
                to be in his right place, he was never in haste to be off elsewhere, 
                was occupied all the time. Here in town he was in a continual 
                hurry, as though afraid of missing something, and yet he had nothing 
                to do. And she felt pity for him. To others, she knew, he did 
                not appear an object of pity; on the contrary, when Kitty looked 
                at him in society, as one sometimes looks at those one loves, 
                trying to see him as if he were a stranger, so as to catch the 
                impression he must make on others, she saw with a panic even of 
                jealous fear that he was far indeed from being a pitiable figure, 
                that he was very attractive with his honesty, his rather old-fashioned, 
                reserved courtesy to women, his powerful figure, and striking, 
                as she thought, and expressive face. But she saw him not from 
                without, but from within; she saw that here he was not himself; 
                that was the only way she could define his condition to herself. 
                Sometimes she inwardly reproached him for his inability to live 
                in the town; sometimes she recognized that it was really hard 
                for him to order his life here so that he could be satisfied with 
                it. </p>
              <p> What had he to do, indeed? He did not care for cards; he did 
                not go to a club. Spending the time with jovial gentlemen of Oblonsky's 
                type - she knew now what that meant... it meant drinking, and 
                going somewhere after drinking. She could not think without horror 
                of where men went on such occasions. Was he to go into society? 
                But she knew he could only find satisfaction in that if he took 
                pleasure in the society of young women, and that she could not 
                wish for. Should he stay at home with her, her mother, and her 
                sisters? But much as she liked and enjoyed their conversations 
                forever on the same subjects - `Alines-Nadines,' as the old Prince 
                called the sisters' talks - she knew it must bore him. What was 
                there left for him to do? To go on writing his book? He had indeed 
                attempted to do it; and at first he used to go to the library 
                and make extracts and look up references for his book, but, as 
                he told her, the more he did nothing, the less time he had to 
                do anything. And besides, he complained that he had talked too 
                much about his book here, and that consequently all his ideas 
                about it were muddled and had lost their interest for him. </p>
              <p> One advantage in this town life was that quarrels hardly ever 
                happened between them here in town. Whether it was that their 
                conditions, in town, were different, or that they had both become 
                more careful and sensible in that respect, they had no quarrels 
                in Moscow from jealousy, which they had so dreaded when they moved 
                from the country. </p>
              <p> One event, an event of great importance to both from that point 
                of view, did indeed happen - which was Kitty's meeting with Vronsky. 
              </p>
              <p> The old Princess Marya Borissovna, Kitty's godmother, who had 
                always been very fond of her, had insisted on seeing her. Kitty, 
                though she did not go into society at all on account of her condition, 
                went with her father to see the venerable old lady, and there 
                met Vronsky. </p>
              <p> The only thing Kitty could reproach herself for at this meeting 
                was that at the instant when she recognized in his civilian dress 
                the features once so familiar to her, her breath failed her, the 
                blood rushed to her heart, and a vivid blush - she felt it - overspread 
                her face. But this lasted only a few seconds. Before her father, 
                who purposely began talking in a loud voice to Vronsky, had finished, 
                she was perfectly ready to look at Vronsky, to speak to him, if 
                necessary, exactly as she spoke to Princess Marya Borissovna, 
                and, more than that, to do so in such a way that everything, to 
                the faintest intonation and smile would have been approved by 
                her husband, whose unseen presence she seemed to feel about her 
                at that instant. </p>
              <p> She said a few words to him, even smiled serenely at his joke 
                about the elections, which he called `our parliament.' (She had 
                to smile to show she saw the joke.) But she turned away immediately 
                to Princess Marya Borissovna, and did not once glance at him till 
                he got up to go; then she looked at him, but evidently only because 
                it would be uncivil not to look at a man when he is saying good-by. 
              </p>
              <p> She was grateful to her father for saying nothing to her about 
                their meeting Vronsky, but she saw by his special warmth to her 
                after the visit, during their usual walk, that he was pleased 
                with her. She was pleased with herself. She had not expected she 
                would have had the power, while keeping somewhere in the bottom 
                of her heart all the memories of her old feeling for Vronsky, 
                not only to seem, but to be, perfectly indifferent and composed 
                with him. </p>
              <p> Levin flushed a great deal more than she when she told him she 
                had met Vronsky at Princess Marya Borissovna's. It was very hard 
                for her to tell him this, but still harder to go on speaking of 
                the details of the meeting, as he did not question her, but simply 
                gazed at her with a frown. </p>
              <p> `I am very sorry you weren't there,' she said. `It wasn't so 
                much the fact that you weren't in the room... I couldn't have 
                been so natural in your presence... I am blushing now much more 
                - much, much more,' she said, blushing till the tears came into 
                her eyes. `But it's a pity you couldn't have looked through a 
                peephole.' </p>
              <p> The truthful eyes told Levin that she was satisfied with herself, 
                and, in spite of her blushing he was quickly reassured and began 
                questioning her, which was all she wanted. When he had heard everything, 
                even to the detail that for the first second she could not help 
                flushing, but that afterward she was just as direct and as much 
                at her ease as with any chance acquaintance, Levin was quite happy 
                again and said he was glad of it, and would not now behave as 
                stupidly as he had done at the election, but would try the first 
                time he met Vronsky to be as friendly as possible. </p>
              <p> `It's so wretched to feel that there's any man who is almost 
                your enemy, and whom it's painful to meet,' said Levin. `I'm very, 
                very glad.' </p>

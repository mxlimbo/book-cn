              <p><br>
                The sixth day was fixed for the election of the marshal of the 
                province. The rooms, large and small, were full of nobleman in 
                all sorts of uniforms. Many had come only for that day. Men who 
                had not seen each other for years, some from the Crimea, some 
                from Peterburg, some from abroad, met in the rooms of the Hall 
                of Nobility. There was much discussion around the province table 
                under the portrait of the Czar. </p>
              <p>The nobles, both in the larger and in the smaller rooms, grouped 
                themselves in camps, and from their hostile and suspicious glances, 
                from the silence that fell upon them when outsiders approached 
                a group, and from the way that some, whispering together, retreated 
                to the farther corridor, it was evident that each side had secrets 
                from the other. In appearance the noblemen were sharply divided 
                into two classes: the old and the new. The old were for the most 
                part either in the old uniform of the nobility, buttoned up closely, 
                with spurs and hats, or in their own special naval, cavalry, infantry 
                uniforms, earned by their former service. The uniforms of the 
                older men were embroidered in the old-fashioned way with small 
                puffs on their shoulders; they were unmistakably tight and short 
                in the waists, as though their wearers had grown out of them. 
                The younger men wore the uniform of the nobility with long waists 
                and broad shoulders, unbuttoned over white waistcoats, or uniforms 
                with black collars and with the embroidered laurel leaves of justices 
                of the peace. To the younger men belonged the Court uniforms that 
                here and there brightened up the crowd. </p>
              <p> But the division into young and old did not correspond with 
                the division of parties. Some of the young men, as Levin observed, 
                belonged to the old party; and some of the very oldest noblemen, 
                on the contrary, were whispering with Sviiazhsky, and were evidently 
                ardent partisans of the new party. </p>
              <p> Levin stood in the smaller room, where they were smoking and 
                taking light refreshments, close to his own friends, and, listening 
                to what they were saying, he vainly exerted all his intelligence 
                trying to understand what was said. Sergei Ivanovich was the center 
                round which the others grouped themselves. He was listening at 
                that moment to Sviiazhsky and Khliustov, the marshal of another 
                district, who belonged to their party. Khliustov would not agree 
                to go with his district to ask Snetkov to be a candidate, while 
                Sviiazhsky was persuading him to do so, and Sergei Ivanovich was 
                approving of the plan. Levin could not make out why the opposition 
                had to ask the marshal to be a candidate when they wanted to supersede 
                him. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich, who had just been drinking and taking some 
                snack lunch, came up to them in his uniform of a gentleman of 
                the bedchamber, wiping his lips with a perfumed handkerchief of 
                bordered batiste. </p>
              <p> `We are placing our forces,' he said, pulling out his side whiskers, 
                `Sergei Ivanovich!' </p>
              <p> And listening to the conversation, he supported Sviiazhsky's 
                contention. </p>
              <p> `One district's enough, and Sviiazhsky's obviously of the opposition,' 
                he said, words evidently intelligible to all except Levin. </p>
              <p> `Why, Kostia, you, it seems, get the taste for these affairs 
                too!' he added, turning to Levin and drawing his arm through his. 
                Levin would have been glad indeed to get the taste for these affairs, 
                but could not make out what the point was, and retreating a few 
                steps from the speakers, he explained to Stepan Arkadyevich his 
                inability to understand why the marshal of the province should 
                be asked to be a candidate. </p>
              <p> `O sancta simplicitas!' said Stepan Arkadyevich, and briefly 
                and clearly he explained it to Levin. </p>
              <p> If, as at previous elections, all the districts asked the marshal 
                of the province to be a candidate, then he would be elected without 
                a ballot. That must not be. Now eight districts had agreed to 
                call upon him: if two refused to do so, Snetkov might decline 
                the candidacy entirely; and then the old party might choose another 
                of their party, which would throw them completely out in their 
                reckoning. But if only one district, Sviiazhsky's, did not call 
                upon him to be a candidate, Snetkov would let himself be balloted 
                for. They were even, some of them, going to vote for him, and 
                purposely to let him get a good many votes, so that the enemy 
                might be thrown off the scent, and when a candidate of the other 
                side was put up, they too might give him some votes. Levin understood 
                to some extent, but not fully, and would have put a few more questions, 
                when suddenly everyone began talking and making a noise, and they 
                moved toward the big room. </p>
              <p> `What is it? Eh? Whom?... Proxy? Whose? What?... They won't 
                pass him?... No proxy?... They won't let Fliorov in?... Eh, because 
                of the charge against him?... Why, at this rate, they won't admit 
                anyone. It's a swindle!... The law!' Levin heard exclamations 
                on all sides, and he moved into the big room together with the 
                others, all hurrying somewhere and afraid of missing something. 
                Squeezed by the crowding noblemen, he drew near the high table 
                where the marshal of the province, Sviiazhsky, and the other leaders, 
                were hotly disputing about something. </p>

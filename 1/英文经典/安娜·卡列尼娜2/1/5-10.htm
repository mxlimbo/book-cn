              <p><br>
                The artist Mikhailov was, as always, at work when the cards of 
                Count Vronsky and Golenishchev were brought to him. In the morning 
                he had been working in his studio at his big picture. On getting 
                home he flew into a rage with his wife for not having managed 
                to put off the landlady, who had been asking for money. </p>
              <p>`I've said it to you twenty times, don't enter into details. 
                You're fool enough at all times, and when you start explaining 
                things in Italian you're a triple fool,' he said after a long 
                dispute. </p>
              <p> `Don't let it run so long; it's not my fault. If I had the money...' 
              </p>
              <p> `Leave me in peace, for God's sake!' Mikhailov shrieked, with 
                tears in his voice, and, stopping his ears, he went off into his 
                working room, on the other side of a partition wall, and closed 
                the door after him. `There's no sense in her!' he said to himself, 
                sat down to the table, and, opening a portfolio, he set to work 
                at once with peculiar fervor at a sketch he had begun. </p>
              <p> Never did he work with such fervor and success as when things 
                went ill with him, and especially when he quarreled with his wife. 
                `Oh! damn them all!' he thought as he went on working. He was 
                making a sketch for the figure of a man in a violent rage. A sketch 
                had been made before, but he was dissatisfied with it. `No, that 
                one was better.... Where is it?' He went back to his wife, and, 
                scowling and not looking at her, asked his eldest little girl: 
                Where was that piece of paper he had given them? The paper with 
                the discarded sketch on it was found, but it was dirty, and spotted 
                with candle grease. Still, he took the sketch, laid it on his 
                table, and, moving a little away, screwing up his eyes, he fell 
                to gazing at it. All at once he smiled and gesticulated gleefully. 
              </p>
              <p> `That's it! That's it!' he said, and, at once picking up the 
                pencil, he began drawing rapidly. The spot of tallow had given 
                the man a new pose. </p>
              <p> He had sketched this new pose, when all at once he recalled 
                the face of a shopkeeper of whom he had bought cigars, a vigorous 
                face with a prominent chin, and he sketched this very face, this 
                chin, on to the figure of the man. He laughed aloud with delight. 
                The figure from a lifeless imagined thing had become living, and 
                such that it could never be changed. That figure lived, and was 
                clearly and unmistakably defined. The sketch might be corrected 
                in accordance with the requirements of the figure; the legs, indeed, 
                could and must be put differently, and the position of the left 
                hand must be quite altered; the hair, too, might be thrown back. 
                But in making these corrections he was not altering the figure 
                but simply getting rid of what concealed the figure. He was, as 
                it were, stripping off the veils which hindered it from being 
                distinctly seen; each new feature only brought out the whole figure 
                in all its force and vigor, as it had suddenly come to him from 
                the spot of tallow. He was carefully finishing the figure when 
                the cards were brought him. </p>
              <p> `Coming, coming!' </p>
              <p> He went in to his wife. </p>
              <p> `Come, Sasha, don't be cross!' he said, smiling timidly and 
                affectionately at her. `You were to blame. I was to blame. I'll 
                make it all right.' And, having made peace with his wife, he put 
                on an olive-green overcoat with a velvet collar and a hat, and 
                went toward his studio. The successful figure he had already forgotten. 
                Now he was delighted and excited at the visit of these people 
                of consequence, Russians, who had come in their carriage. </p>
              <p> Of his picture, the one that stood now on his easel, he had 
                at the bottom of his heart one conviction - that no one had ever 
                painted a picture like it. He did not believe that this picture 
                was better than all the pictures of Raphael, but he knew that 
                what he tried to convey in that picture no one ever had conveyed. 
                This he knew positively, and had known a long while, ever since 
                he had begun to paint it. But other people's criticisms, whatever 
                they might be, had yet immense consequence in his eyes, and they 
                agitated him to the depths of his soul. Any remark, the most insignificant, 
                which showed that the critic saw even the tiniest part of what 
                he himself saw in the picture, agitated him to the depths of his 
                soul. He always attributed to his judges a more profound comprehension 
                than he had himself, and always expected from them something he 
                did not himself see in the picture. And often in their criticisms 
                he fancied that he found this. </p>
              <p> He walked rapidly to the door of his studio, and in spite of 
                his excitement he was struck by the soft light on Anna's figure 
                as she stood in the shade of the entrance listening to Golenishchev, 
                who was eagerly telling her something, while she evidently wanted 
                to look round at the artist. He was himself unconscious how, as 
                he approached them, he seized on this impression and absorbed 
                it, as he had the chin of the shopkeeper who had sold him the 
                cigars, and put it away somewhere to be brought out when he wanted 
                it. The visitors, not agreeably impressed beforehand by Golenishchev's 
                account of the artist, were still less so by his personal appearance. 
                Thickset and of middle height, with nimble movements, with his 
                brown hat, olive-green coat and narrow trousers - though wide 
                trousers had been a long while in fashion - most of all, with 
                the ordinariness of his broad face, and the combined expression 
                of timidity and anxiety to keep up his dignity, Mikhailov made 
                an unpleasant impression. </p>
              <p> `Please step in,' he said, trying to look indifferent, and going 
                into the passage he took a key out of his pocket and opened the 
                door. </p>

              <p><br>
                `They've come!' `Here he is!' `Which one?' `Rather young, eh?' 
                `Why, my dear soul, she looks more dead than alive!' were the 
                comments in the crowd, when Levin, meeting his bride in the entrance, 
                walked with her into the church. <br>
                Stepan Arkadyevich told his wife the cause of the delay, and the 
                guests were whispering it with smiles to one another. Levin saw 
                nothing and no one; he did not take his eyes off his bride. </p>
              <p> Everyone said she had lost her looks dreadfully of late, and 
                was not nearly as pretty on her wedding day as usual; but Levin 
                did not think so. He looked at her hair done up high, with the 
                long white veil and white flowers and the high, scalloped de Medici 
                collar, that in such a maidenly fashion hid her long neck at the 
                sides and only showed it in front, and her strikingly slender 
                figure, and it seemed to him that she looked better than ever 
                - not because these flowers, this veil, this gown from Paris added 
                anything to her beauty; but because, in spite of the elaborate 
                sumptuousness of her attire, the expression of her sweet face, 
                of her eyes, of her lips was still her own characteristic expression 
                of guileless truthfulness. </p>
              <p> `I was beginning to think you meant to run away,' she said, 
                and smiled to him. </p>
              <p> What happened to me is so stupid I'm ashamed to speak of it!' 
                he said, reddening, and he was obliged to turn to Sergei Ivanovich, 
                who came up to him. </p>
              <p> `This is a pretty story of yours about the shirt!' said Sergei 
                Ivanovich, shaking his head and smiling. </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes!' answered Levin, without an idea of what they were 
                talking about. </p>
              <p> `Now, Kostia, you have to decide,' said Stepan Arkadyevich with 
                an air of mock dismay, `a weighty question. You are at this moment 
                just in the humor to appreciate all its gravity. They ask me, 
                are they to light the candles that have been lighted before or 
                candles that have never been lighted? It's a matter of ten roubles,' 
                he added, relaxing his lips into a smile. `I have decided, but 
                I was afraid you might not agree.' </p>
              <p> Levin saw it was a joke, but he could not smile. </p>
              <p> `Well, how's it to be then - unused or used candles? - that 
                is the question.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes, unused ones.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, I'm very glad. The question's decided!' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                smiling. `How silly men become, though, in this situation,' he 
                said to Chirikov, when Levin, after looking absently at him, had 
                moved back to his bride. </p>
              <p> `Kitty, mind you're the first to step on the carpet,' said Countess 
                Nordstone, coming up. `You're a fine person!' she said to Levin. 
              </p>
              <p> `Aren't you frightened, eh?' said Marya Dmitrievna, an old aunt. 
              </p>
              <p> `Are you cold? You're pale. Stop a minute, stoop down,' said 
                Kitty's sister, Madame Lvova, and with her plump, pretty hands 
                she smilingly set straight the flowers on her head. </p>
              <p> Dolly came up, tried to say something, but could not speak, 
                cried, and then laughed naturally. </p>
              <p> Kitty looked at all of them with the same absent eyes as Levin. 
              </p>
              <p> Meanwhile the officiating clergy had got into their vestments, 
                and the priest and deacon came out to the lectern, which stood 
                in the porch of the church. The priest turned to Levin saying 
                something. Levin did not hear what the priest said. </p>
              <p> `Take the bride's hand and lead her up,' the best man said to 
                Levin. </p>
              <p> It was a long while before Levin could make out what was expected 
                of him. For a long time they tried to set him right and made him 
                begin again - because he kept taking Kitty by the wrong arm or 
                with the wrong arm - till he understood at last that what he had 
                to do was, without changing his position, to take her right hand 
                in his right hand. When at last he had taken the bride's hand 
                in the correct way, the priest walked a few paces in front of 
                them and stopped at the lectern. The crowd of friends and relations 
                moved after them, with a buzz of talk and a rustle of trains. 
                Someone stooped down and straightened out the bride's train. The 
                church became so still that the drops of wax could be heard falling 
                from the candles. </p>
              <p> The little old priest in his calotte, with his long silvery-gray 
                locks of hair parted behind his ears, was fumbling with something 
                at the lectern, putting out his little old hands from under the 
                heavy silver vestment with the gold cross on the back of it. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich approached him cautiously, whispered something, 
                and, giving a wink at Levin, walked back again. </p>
              <p> The priest lighted two candles, wreathed with flowers, and holding 
                them sideways so that the wax dropped slowly from them he turned, 
                facing the bridal pair. The priest was the same old man who had 
                confessed Levin. He looked with weary and melancholy eyes at the 
                bride and bridegroom, sighed, and, putting his right hand out 
                from under his vestment, blessed the bridegroom with it, and also, 
                with a shade of solicitous tenderness, laid his crossed fingers 
                on the bowed head of Kitty. Then he gave them the candles, and, 
                taking the censer, moved slowly away from them. </p>
              <p> `Can it be true?' thought Levin, and he looked round at his 
                bride. Looking down at her he saw her face in profile, and from 
                the scarcely perceptible quiver of her lips and eyelashes he knew 
                she was aware of his eyes upon her. She did not look round, but 
                the high scalloped collar, that reached her little pink ear, trembled 
                faintly. He saw that a sigh was held back in her throat, and the 
                little hand in the long glove shook as it held the candle. </p>
              <p> All the fuss of the shirt, of being late, all the talk of friends 
                and relations, their annoyance, his ludicrous position - all suddenly 
                passed away and he was filled with joy and dread. </p>
              <p> The handsome, stately protodeacon wearing a silver robe, and 
                his curly locks standing out at each side of his head, stepped 
                smartly forward, and lifting his stole on two fingers, stood opposite 
                the priest. </p>
              <p> `Blessed be the name of the Lord,' the solemn syllables rang 
                out slowly one after another, setting the air quivering with waves 
                of sound. </p>
              <p> `Blessed is the name of our God, from the beginning, as now, 
                and forever and aye,' the little old priest answered in a submissive, 
                piping voice, still fingering something at the lectern. And the 
                full chorus of the unseen choir rose up, filling the whole church, 
                from the windows to the vaulted roof, with broad waves of melody. 
                It grew stronger, rested for an instant, and slowly died away. 
              </p>
              <p> They prayed, as they always do, for peace from on high and for 
                salvation, for the Holy Synod, and for the Czar; they prayed, 
                too, for the servants of God, Konstantin and Ekaterina, now plighting 
                their troth. </p>
              <p> `Vouchsafe to them love made perfect, peace, and help, O Lord, 
                we beseech Thee,' the whole church seemed to breathe with the 
                voice of the protodeacon. </p>
              <p> Levin heard the words, and they impressed him. `How did they 
                guess that it is help, just help that one wants?' he thought, 
                recalling all his fears and doubts of late. `What do I know? what 
                can I do in this fearful business,' he thought, `without help? 
                Yes, it is help I want now.' </p>
              <p> When the deacon had finished the liturgical prayer, the priest 
                turned to the bridal pair with his book: `Eternal God, who joinest 
                together in love them that were separate,' he read in a gentle, 
                piping voice, `who hast ordained the union of holy wedlock that 
                cannot be set asunder, Thou who didst bless Isaac and Rebecca 
                and their descendants, according to Thy Holy Covenant, bless Thou 
                Thy servants, Konstantin and Ekaterina, leading them in the path 
                of all good works. For gracious and merciful art Thou, our Lord, 
                and glory be to Thee, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, 
                now and forever and aye.' - `Amen!' the unseen choir sent rolling 
                again through the air. </p>
              <p> `'Joinest together in love them that were separate.' What deep 
                meaning in those words, and how they correspond with what one 
                feels at this moment,' thought Levin. `Is she feeling the same 
                as I?' </p>
              <p> And, looking round, he met her eyes. And from their expression 
                he concluded that she was understanding it just as he was. But 
                this was a mistake; she almost completely missed the meaning of 
                the words of the service; she had not heard them, in fact. She 
                could not listen to them and take them in, so strong was the one 
                feeling that filled her breast and grew stronger and stronger. 
                That feeling was joy at the completion of the process that for 
                the last month and a half had been going on in her soul, and had 
                during those six weeks been a joy and a torture to her. On the 
                day when in the drawing room of the house in the Arbat street 
                she had gone up to him in her brown dress, and had given herself 
                to him without a word - on that day, at that hour, there took 
                place in her heart a complete severance from all her old life, 
                and a quite different, new, utterly strange life had begun for 
                her, while the old life was actually going on as before. Those 
                six weeks had for her been a time of the utmost bliss and the 
                utmost misery. All her life, all her desires and hopes were concentrated 
                on this one man, still uncomprehended by her, to whom she was 
                bound by a feeling of alternate attraction and repulsion, even 
                less comprehended than the man himself, and all the while she 
                was going on living in the outward conditions of her old life. 
                Living the old life, she was horrified at herself, at her utter 
                insurmountable callousness to all her own past, to things, to 
                habits, to the people she had loved, who loved her - to her mother, 
                who was wounded by her indifference, to her kind, tender father, 
                till then dearer than all the world. At one moment she was horrified 
                at this indifference, at another she rejoiced at what had brought 
                her to this indifference. She could not frame a thought, nor a 
                wish, apart from life with this man; but this new life was not 
                yet, and she could not even picture it clearly to herself. There 
                was only anticipation, the dread and joy of the new and the unknown. 
                And now behold anticipation and uncertainty and remorse at the 
                abandonment of the old life - all this was ending, and the new 
                was beginning. This new life could not but have terrors for her 
                by its obscurity; but, terrible or not, the change had been wrought 
                six weeks before in her soul, and this was merely the final sanction 
                of what had long been completed in her heart. </p>
              <p> Turning again to the lectern, the priest with some difficulty 
                took Kitty's little ring, and, asking Levin for his hand, put 
                it on the first joint of his finger. `The servant of God, Konstantin, 
                plights his troth to the servant of God, Ekaterina.' And putting 
                his big ring on Kitty's touchingly weak, pink tiny finger, the 
                priest said the same thing. </p>
              <p> And the bridal pair tried several times to understand what they 
                had to do, and each time made some mistake and were corrected 
                by the priest in a whisper. At last, having duly performed the 
                ceremony, having made with the rings the sign of the cross over 
                them, the priest handed Kitty the big ring, and Levin the little 
                one. Again they were puzzled, and passed the rings from hand to 
                hand, still without doing what was expected. </p>
              <p> Dolly, Chirikov, and Stepan Arkadyevich stepped forward to set 
                them right. There was an interval of hesitation, whispering, and 
                smiles; but the expression of solemn emotion on the faces of the 
                betrothed pair did not change: on the contrary, in their perplexity 
                over their hands they looked more grave and deeply moved than 
                before, and the smile with which Stepan Arkadyevich whispered 
                to them that now they would each put on their own ring died away 
                on his lips. He had a feeling that any smile would jar on them. 
              </p>
              <p> `Thou who didst from the beginning create male and female,' 
                the priest read after the exchange of rings, `from Thee woman 
                was given to man to be a helpmeet to him, and for the procreation 
                of children. O Lord, our God, who hast poured down the blessings 
                of Thy Truth according to Thy Holy Covenant upon Thy chosen servants, 
                our fathers, from generation to generation, bless Thy servants 
                Konstantin and Ekaterina, and make their troth fast in faith, 
                and union of hearts, and in truth, and in love....' </p>
              <p> Levin felt more and more that all his ideas of marriage, all 
                his dreams of how he would order his life, were mere childishness, 
                and that it was something he had not understood hitherto, and 
                now understood less than ever, though it was being performed upon 
                him. The lump in his throat rose higher and higher; tears that 
                would not be checked came into his eyes. </p>

              <p><br>
                The old Prince and Sergei Ivanovich got into the wagonette and 
                drove off; the rest of the party hastened homeward on foot. </p>
              <p>But the storm clouds, turning white and then black, moved down 
                so quickly that they had to quicken their pace to get home before 
                the rain. The foremost clouds, lowering and black as soot-laden 
                smoke, rushed with extraordinary swiftness over the sky. They 
                were still two hundred paces from home and a gust of wind had 
                already blown up, and every second the downpour might be looked 
                for. </p>
              <p> The children ran ahead with frightened and gleeful shrieks. 
                Darya Alexandrovna, struggling painfully with her skirts clinging 
                round her legs, was not walking, but running, her eyes fixed on 
                the children. The men of the party, holding their hats on, strode 
                with long steps beside her. They were just at the steps when a 
                big drop fell splashing on the edge of the iron guttering. The 
                children and their elders after them ran into the shelter of the 
                house, talking merrily. </p>
              <p> `Katerina Alexandrovna?' Levin asked of Agathya Mikhailovna, 
                who met them with shawls and plaids in the hall. </p>
              <p> `We thought she was with you,' she said. </p>
              <p> `And Mitia?' </p>
              <p> `In Kolok, he must be, and the nurse with him.' </p>
              <p> Levin snatched up the plaids and ran toward the copse. </p>
              <p> In that brief interval of time the storm clouds had moved on, 
                covering the sun so completely that it was dark as an eclipse. 
                Stubbornly, as though insisting on its rights, the wind stopped 
                Levin, and tearing the leaves and flowers off the linden trees 
                and stripping the white birch branches into strange unseemly nakedness, 
                it twisted everything to one side - acacias, flowers, burdocks, 
                long grass, and tall treetops. The peasant girls working in the 
                garden ran shrieking into shelter in the servants' quarters. The 
                streaming rain had already flung its white veil over all the distant 
                forest and half the fields close by, and was rapidly swooping 
                down upon the copse. The wet of the rain spurting up in tiny drops 
                could be smelled in the air. </p>
              <p> Holding his head bent down before him, and struggling with the 
                wind that strove to tear the wraps away from him, Levin was moving 
                up to the copse and had just caught sight of something white behind 
                the oak tree, when there was a sudden flash, the whole earth seemed 
                on fire, and the vault of heaven seemed crashing overhead. Opening 
                his blinded eyes, Levin gazed through the thick veil of rain that 
                separated him now from the copse, and to his horror the first 
                thing he saw was the green crest of the familiar oak tree in the 
                middle of the copse uncannily changing its position. `Can it have 
                been struck?' Levin hardly had time to think when, moving more 
                and more rapidly, the oak tree vanished behind the other trees, 
                and he heard the crash of the great tree falling upon the others. 
              </p>
              <p> The flash of lightning, the crash of thunder, and the instantaneous 
                chill that ran through him were all merged for Levin in one sense 
                of terror. </p>
              <p> `My God! My God! Not on them!' he said. </p>
              <p> And though he thought at once how senseless was his prayer that 
                they should not have been killed by the oak which had fallen now, 
                he repeated it, knowing that he could do nothing better than utter 
                this senseless prayer. </p>
              <p> Running up to the place where they usually went, he did not 
                find them there. </p>
              <p> They were at the other end of the copse under an old linden 
                tree; they were calling him. Two figures in dark dresses (they 
                had been light summer dresses when they started out) were standing 
                bending over something. It was Kitty with the nurse. The rain 
                was already ceasing, and it was beginning to get light when Levin 
                reached them. The nurse was not wet on the lower part of her dress, 
                but Kitty was drenched through, and her soaked clothes clung to 
                her. Though the rain was over, they still stood in the same position 
                in which they had been standing when the storm broke. Both stood 
                bending over a perambulator with a green umbrella. </p>
              <p> `Alive? Unhurt? Thank God!' he said, splashing with his soaked 
                boots through the standing water and running up to them. </p>
              <p> Kitty's rosy wet face was turned toward him, and she smiled 
                timidly under her shapeless sopping hat. </p>
              <p> `Aren't you ashamed of yourself? I can't think how you can be 
                so reckless!' he said angrily to his wife. </p>
              <p> `It wasn't my fault, really. We were just intending to go, when 
                he made such a to-do that we had to change him. We were just...' 
                Kitty began defending herself. </p>
              <p> Mitia was unharmed, dry, and still fast asleep. </p>
              <p> `Well, thank God! I don't know what I'm saying!' </p>
              <p> They gathered up the baby's wet belongings; the nurse picked 
                up the baby and carried it. Levin walked beside his wife, and, 
                penitent for having been angry, he squeezed her hand when the 
                nurse was not looking. </p>

              <p><br>
                A bell rang, some young men, ugly and impudent, and at the same 
                time careful of the impression they were making, hurried by. Piotr, 
                too, crossed the room in his livery and spatterdashes with his 
                dull, brutish face, and came up to her to take her to the train. 
                The noisy young men were quiet as she passed them on the platform, 
                and one whispered something about her to another - something vile, 
                no doubt. She stepped up on the high step, and sat down in a carriage 
                by herself on a dirty spring seat that had once been white. Her 
                bag lay beside her, shaken up and down by the springiness of the 
                seat. With a foolish smile Piotr raised his hat, with its gallooned 
                band, at the window, in token of farewell; an impudent conductor 
                slammed the door and the latch. A grotesque-looking lady wearing 
                a bustle (Anna mentally undressed the woman, and was appalled 
                at her hideousness), and a little girl laughing affectedly, ran 
                down the platform. </p>
              <p>`Katerina Andreevna, she's got them all, ma tante!' cried the 
                girl. </p>
              <p> `Even the child's hideous and affected,' thought Anna. To avoid 
                seeing anyone, she got up quickly and seated herself at the opposite 
                window of the empty carriage. A misshapen-looking peasant covered 
                with dirt, in a cap from which his tangled hair stuck out all 
                around, passed by that window, stooping down to the carriage wheels. 
                `There's something familiar about that hideous peasant,' thought 
                Anna. And remembering her dream, she moved away to the opposite 
                door, shaking with terror. The conductor opened the door and let 
                in a man and his wife. </p>
              <p> `Do you wish to get out?' </p>
              <p> Anna made no answer. The conductor and her two fellow passengers 
                did not notice under her veil her panic-stricken face. She went 
                back to her corner and sat down. The couple seated themselves 
                on the opposite side, and intently but surreptitiously scrutinized 
                her clothes. Both husband and wife seemed repulsive to Anna. The 
                husband asked if she would allow him to smoke, obviously not with 
                a view to smoking, but to getting into conversation with her. 
                Receiving her assent, he said to his wife in French something 
                about caring less to smoke than to talk. They made inane and affected 
                remarks to one another, entirely for her benefit. Anna saw clearly 
                that they were sick of each other, and hated each other. And no 
                one could have helped hating such miserable monstrosities. </p>
              <p> A second bell sounded, and was followed by moving of luggage, 
                noise, shouting and laughter. It was so clear to Anna that there 
                was nothing for anyone to be glad of, that this laughter irritated 
                her agonizingly, and she would have liked to stop up her ears 
                not to hear it. At last the third bell rang, there was a whistle 
                and a hiss of steam, and a clank of chains, and the man in her 
                carriage crossed himself. `It would be interesting to ask him 
                what meaning he attaches to that,' thought Anna, looking angrily 
                at him. She looked past the lady out of the window at the people 
                who seemed whirling by, as they ran beside the train or stood 
                on the platform. The train, jerking at regular intervals at the 
                junctions of the rails, rolled by the platform, past a stone wall, 
                a signal box, past other trains; the wheels, moving more smoothly 
                and evenly, resounded with a slight clang on the rails. The window 
                was lighted up by the bright evening sun, and a slight breeze 
                fluttered the curtain. Anna forgot her fellow passengers, and 
                to the light swaying of the train she fell to thinking again, 
                as she breathed the fresh air. </p>
              <p> `Yes, what did I stop at? That I couldn't find a condition in 
                which life would not be a misery, that we are all created to be 
                miserable, and that we all know it, and all invent means of deceiving 
                each other. And when one sees the truth, what is one to do?' </p>
              <p> `That's why reason is given to man, to escape from what worries 
                him,' said the lady in French, lisping affectedly, and obviously 
                pleased with her phrase. </p>
              <p> The words seemed an answer to Anna's thoughts. </p>
              <p> `To escape from what worries him,' repeated Anna. And glancing 
                at the red-cheeked husband and the thin wife, she saw that the 
                sickly wife considered herself misunderstood, and the husband 
                deceived her and encouraged her in that idea of herself. Anna 
                seemed to see all their history and all the crannies of their 
                souls, turning a light upon them, as it were. But there was nothing 
                interesting in them, and she pursued her thought. </p>
              <p> `Yes, I'm very much worried, and that's why reason was given 
                me, to escape; so then, one must escape: why not put out the light 
                when there's nothing more to look at, when it's sickening to look 
                at it all? But how? Why did the conductor run along the footboard, 
                why are they shrieking, those young men in that train? Why are 
                they talking, why are they laughing? It's all falsehood, all lying, 
                all humbug, all cruelty!...' </p>
              <p> When the train came into the station, Anna got out into the 
                crowd of passengers, and moving apart from them as if they were 
                lepers, she stood on the platform, trying to think what she had 
                come here for, and what she meant to do. Everything that had seemed 
                to her possible before was now so difficult to consider, especially 
                in this noisy crowd of hideous people who would not leave her 
                alone. At one moment porters ran up to her proffering their services, 
                then young men clacking their heels on the planks of the platform 
                and talking loudly, stared at her, then people meeting her dodged 
                past on the wrong side. Remembering that she had meant to go on 
                farther if there was no answer, she stopped a porter and asked 
                if her coachman were not here with a note from Count Vronsky. 
              </p>
              <p> `Count Vronsky? They sent up here from the Vronskys just this 
                minute, to meet Princess Sorokina and her daughter. And what is 
                the coachman like?' </p>
              <p> Just as she was talking to the porter, the coachman Mikhail, 
                red and cheerful in his smart blue coat and chain, evidently proud 
                of having so successfully performed his commission, came up to 
                her and gave her a letter. She broke it open, and her heart ached 
                before she had read it. </p>
              <p> `I am very sorry your note did not reach me. I will be home 
                at ten,' Vronsky had written carelessly. </p>
              <p> `Yes, that's what I expected!' she said to herself with an evil 
                smile. </p>
              <p> `Very good, you can go home now,' she said softly, addressing 
                Mikhail. She spoke softly because the rapidity of her heart's 
                beating hindered her breathing. `No, I won't let Thee make me 
                miserable,' she thought menacingly, addressing not him, not herself, 
                but the power that made her suffer, and she walked along the platform. 
              </p>
              <p> Two maidservants walking along the platform turned their heads, 
                staring at her and making some remarks about her dress. `Real,' 
                they said of the lace she was wearing. The young men would not 
                leave her in peace. Again they passed by, peering into her face, 
                and with a laugh shouting something in an unnatural voice. The 
                stationmaster coming up asked her whether she was going by the 
                train. A boy selling kvass never took his eyes off her. `My God! 
                Where am I to go?' she thought, going farther and farther along 
                the platform. At the end she stopped. Some ladies and children, 
                who had come to meet a gentleman in spectacles, paused in their 
                loud laughter and talking, and stared at her as she reached them. 
                She quickened her pace and walked away from them to the edge of 
                the platform. A goods train was coming in. The platform began 
                to sway, and she fancied she was in the train again. </p>
              <p> And all at once she thought of the man crushed by the train 
                the day she had first met Vronsky, and she knew what she had to 
                do. With a rapid, light step she went down the steps that led 
                from the platform to the rails and stopped quite near the approaching 
                train. She looked at the lower part of the carriages, at the screws 
                and chains, and the tall cast-iron wheel of the first carriage 
                slowly moving up, and tried to measure the middle between the 
                front and back wheels, and the very minute when that middle point 
                would be opposite her. </p>
              <p> `There,' she said to herself, looking into the shadow of the 
                carriage, at the sand and coal dust which covered the sleepers 
                - `there, in the very middle, and I will punish him and escape 
                from everyone and from myself.' </p>
              <p> She tried to fling herself below the wheels of the first car 
                as it reached her; but the red bag which she tried to drop out 
                of her hand delayed her, and she was too late; she missed the 
                middle of the car. She had to wait for the next one. A feeling 
                such as she had known when about to take the first plunge in bathing 
                came upon her, and she crossed herself. That familiar gesture 
                of crossing brought back into her soul a whole series of girlish 
                and childish memories, and suddenly the darkness that had covered 
                everything for her was torn apart, and life rose up before her 
                for an instant with all its bright past joys. But she did not 
                take her eyes from the wheels of the second car. And exactly at 
                the moment when the space between the wheels came opposite her, 
                she dropped the red bag, and drawing her head back into her shoulders, 
                fell on her hands under the car, and lightly, as though she would 
                rise again at once, dropped onto her knees. And at the same instant 
                she was terror-stricken at what she was doing. `Where am I? What 
                am I doing? What for?' She tried to get up, to drop backward; 
                but something huge and merciless struck her on the head and drew 
                along on her back. `Lord, forgive me all!' she said, feeling it 
                impossible to struggle. A peasant, muttering something, was working 
                at the iron. And the candle by which she had been reading the 
                book filled with troubles, falsehoods, sorrow, and evil, flared 
                up more brightly than ever before, lighted up for her all that 
                had been in darkness, sputtered, began to grow dim, and was quenched 
                forever. </p>

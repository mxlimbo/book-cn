              <p><br>
                Sviiazhsky took Levin's arm, and went with him to his own friends. 
                This time there was no avoiding Vronsky. He was standing with 
                Stepan Arkadyevich and Sergei Ivanovich, and looking straight 
                at Levin as he drew near. <br>
                `Delighted! I believe I've had the pleasure of meeting you... 
                at Princess Shcherbatskaia's,' he said, giving Levin his hand. 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, I quite remember our meeting,' said Levin, and, blushing 
                crimson, he turned away immediately, and began talking to his 
                brother. </p>
              <p> With a slight smile Vronsky went on talking to Sviiazhsky, obviously 
                without the slightest inclination to enter into conversation with 
                Levin. But Levin, as he talked to his brother, was continually 
                looking round at Vronsky, trying to think of something to say 
                to him to smooth over his rudeness. </p>
              <p> `What are we waiting for now?' asked Levin, looking at Sviiazhsky 
                and Vronsky. </p>
              <p> `For Snetkov. He has to refuse or accept the candidacy,' answered 
                Sviiazhsky. </p>
              <p> `Well, and what has he done - consented or not?' </p>
              <p> `That's the point: he's done neither,' said Vronsky. </p>
              <p> `And if he refuses, who will run then?' asked Levin, looking 
                at Vronsky. </p>
              <p> `Whoever chooses to,' said Sviiazhsky. </p>
              <p> `Shall you?' asked Levin. </p>
              <p> `Certainly not I,' said Sviiazhsky, looking confused, and turning 
                an alarmed glance at the venomous gentleman, who was standing 
                beside Sergei Ivanovich. </p>
              <p> `Who then? Neviedovsky?' said Levin, feeling he was putting 
                his foot into it. </p>
              <p> But this was worse still. Neviedovsky and Sviiazhsky were the 
                two candidates. </p>
              <p> `I certainly shall not, under any circumstances,' answered the 
                venomous gentleman. </p>
              <p> This was Neviedovsky himself. Sviiazhsky introduced him to Levin. 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, do you find it exciting too?' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                winking at Vronsky. `It's something like a race. One might bet 
                on it.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, it is keenly exciting,' said Vronsky. `And once taking 
                the thing up, one's eager to see it through. It's a fight!' he 
                said, scowling and setting his powerful jaws. </p>
              <p> `What a businessman Sviiazhsky is! Sees it all so clearly.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes!' Vronsky assented indifferently. </p>
              <p> A silence followed, during which Vronsky - since he had to look 
                at something - looked at Levin, at his feet, at his frock coat, 
                then at his face, and noticing his gloomy eyes fixed upon him, 
                he said, in order to say something: </p>
              <p> `How is it that you, living constantly in the country, are not 
                a justice of the peace? You are not in the uniform of one.' </p>
              <p> `It's because I consider the justice of the peace a silly institution,' 
                morosely answered Levin, who had been all the time looking for 
                an opportunity to enter into conversation with Vronsky, so as 
                to smooth over his rudeness at their first meeting. </p>
              <p> `I don't think so - quite the contrary,' Vronsky said, with 
                calm surprise. </p>
              <p> `It's a plaything,' Levin cut him short. `We don't want justices 
                of the peace. I've never had a single thing to do with them during 
                eight years. And what I have had, was decided wrongly by them. 
                The justice of the peace is over thirty miles from me. For a matter 
                of two roubles or so, I should have to send a lawyer, who costs 
                me fifteen.' </p>
              <p> And he related how a peasant had stolen some flour from the 
                miller, and when the miller told him of it, had lodged a complaint 
                for slander. All this was utterly uncalled-for and stupid, and 
                Levin felt it himself as he said it. </p>
              <p> `Oh, this is such an original fellow!' said Stepan Arkadyevich 
                with his most soothing, almond-oil smile. `But come along; I think 
                they're voting....' </p>
              <p> And they separated. </p>
              <p> `I can't understand,' said Sergei Ivanovich, who had observed 
                his brother's gaucherie, `I can't understand how anyone can be 
                so absolutely devoid of political tact. That's where we Russians 
                are so deficient. The marshal of the province is our opponent, 
                and with him you're ami cochon, and you beg him to be candidate. 
                Count Vronsky, now... I'm not making a friend of him - he's asked 
                me to dinner, and I'm not going; but he's one of our side - why 
                make an enemy of him? Then you ask Neviedovsky if he's going to 
                run. That's not done.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, I don't understand it at all! And it's all such nonsense,' 
                Levin answered somberly. </p>
              <p> `You say it's all such nonsense - yet as soon as you have anything 
                to do with it, you make a muddle.' </p>
              <p> Levin did not answer, and they walked together into the big 
                room. </p>
              <p> The marshal of the province, though he was vaguely conscious 
                in the air of some trap being prepared for him, and though he 
                had not been called upon by all to run, had nevertheless made 
                up his mind to run for office. All was silence in the room. The 
                secretary announced in a loud voice that Mikhail Stepanovich Snetkov, 
                captain of the guards, would now be balloted for as marshal of 
                the province. </p>
              <p> The district marshals walked carrying plates, on which were 
                balls, from their tables to the province table, and the election 
                began. </p>
              <p> `Put it in the right side,' whispered Stepan Arkadyevich, as 
                Levin with his brother followed the marshal of his district to 
                the table. But Levin had forgotten by now the machination that 
                had been explained to him, and was afraid Stepan Arkadyevich might 
                be mistaken in saying `the right side.' Surely Snetkov was the 
                enemy. As he went up, he held the ball in his right hand, but 
                thinking he was wrong, just at the box he changed to the left 
                hand, and undoubtedly put the ball to the left. An adept in the 
                business, standing at the box and seeing by the mere action of 
                the elbow where each put his ball, scowled with annoyance. It 
                was no good for him to use his insight. </p>
              <p> Everything was still, and the counting of the balls was heard. 
                Then a single voice rose and proclaimed the numbers for and against. 
              </p>
              <p> The marshal had been voted for by a considerable majority. All 
                was noise and eager movement toward the doors. Snetkov came in, 
                and the nobles thronged round him, congratulating him. </p>
              <p> `Well, now, is it over?' Levin asked Sergei Ivanovich. </p>
              <p> `It's only just beginning,' Sviiazhsky said, replying for Sergei 
                Ivanovich with a smile. `Some other candidate may receive more 
                votes than the marshal.' </p>
              <p> Levin had quite forgotten about that again. Now he could only 
                remember that there was some sort of trickery in it, but he was 
                too bored to think what it was exactly. He felt depressed, and 
                longed to get out of the crowd. </p>
              <p> As no one was paying any attention to him, and no one apparently 
                needed him, he quietly slipped away into the little room where 
                the refreshments were, and again had a great sense of comfort 
                when he saw the waiters. The little old waiter pressed him to 
                have something, and Levin agreed. After eating a cutlet with beans 
                and talking to the waiters of their former masters, Levin, not 
                wishing to go back to the hall, where it was all so distasteful 
                to him, proceeded to walk through the galleries. </p>
              <p> The galleries were full of fashionably dressed ladies, leaning 
                over the balustrade and trying not to lose a single word of what 
                was being said below. With the ladies were sitting and standing 
                smart lawyers, high school teachers in spectacles, and officers. 
                Everywhere they were talking of the election, and of how worried 
                the marshal was, and how splendid the discussions had been. In 
                one group Levin heard his brother's praises. One lady was telling 
                a lawyer: </p>
              <p> `How glad I am I heard Koznishev! It's worth missing one's lunch. 
                He's exquisite! So clear and distinct - all of it! There's not 
                one of you in the law courts that speaks like that. The only one 
                is Meidel, and he's very far from being so eloquent.' </p>
              <p> Finding a free place, Levin leaned over the balustrade and began 
                looking and listening. </p>
              <p> All the noblemen were sitting railed off behind barriers, according 
                to their districts. In the middle of the room stood a man in a 
                uniform, who shouted in a loud high voice: </p>
              <p> `As a candidate for the marshalship of the nobility of the province 
                we call upon staff captain Eugenii Ivanovich Apukhtin!' A dead 
                silence followed, and then a weak old voice was heard: </p>
              <p> `Declined!' </p>
              <p> `We call upon the privy councilor Piotr Petrovich Bol,' the 
                voice began again. </p>
              <p> `Declined!' a high boyish voice replied. </p>
              <p> Again it began, and again came the `Declined.' And so it went 
                on for about an hour. Levin, with his elbows on the balustrade, 
                looked and listened. At first he wondered and wanted to know what 
                it meant; then feeling sure that he could not make it out he began 
                to be bored. Then, recalling all the excitement and vindictiveness 
                he had seen on all the faces, he felt sad; he made up his mind 
                to go, and went downstairs. As he passed through the entry to 
                the galleries he met a dejected high school boy walking up and 
                down with tired-looking eyes. On the stairs he met a couple - 
                a lady running quickly on her high heels and the jaunty deputy 
                prosecutor. </p>
              <p> `I told you you weren't late,' the deputy prosecutor was saying 
                at the moment when Levin moved aside to let the lady pass. </p>
              <p> Levin was on the stairs to the way out, and was just feeling 
                in his waistcoat pocket for his overcoat check, when the secretary 
                overtook him. `This way, please, Konstantin Dmitrievich; they 
                are voting.' </p>
              <p> The candidate who was being voted on was Neviedovsky, who had 
                so stoutly denied all idea of candidacy. </p>
              <p> Levin went up to the door of the room; it was locked. The secretary 
                knocked, the door opened, and Levin was met by two red-faced gentlemen, 
                who darted out. </p>
              <p> `I can't stand any more of it,' said one red-faced gentleman. 
              </p>
              <p> After them the face of the marshal of the province was poked 
                out. His face was dreadful-looking from exhaustion and dismay. 
              </p>
              <p> `I told you not to let anyone out!' he cried to the doorkeeper. 
              </p>
              <p> `I let someone in, Your Excellency!' </p>
              <p> `Mercy on us!' And with a heavy sigh the marshal of the province 
                walked with downcast head to the high table in the middle of the 
                room, his white-trousered legs wavering from fatigue. </p>
              <p> Neviedovsky had scored a higher majority, as they had planned, 
                and he was the new marshal of the province. Many people were amused, 
                many were pleased and happy, many were in ecstasies, many were 
                disgusted and unhappy. The former marshal of the province was 
                in a state of despair which he could not conceal. When Neviedovsky 
                went out of the room, the crowd thronged round him and followed 
                him enthusiastically, just as they had followed the governor on 
                the first day, when he had opened the meetings, and just as they 
                had followed Snetkov when he had been elected. </p>

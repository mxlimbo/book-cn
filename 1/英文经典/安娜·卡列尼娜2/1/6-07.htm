                Levin came back to the house only when they sent to summon to 
                supper. On the stairs were standing Kitty and Agathya Mikhailovna, 
                consulting about wines for supper. </p>
              <p>`But why are you making all this fuss? Have what we usually do.' 
              </p>
              <p> `No, Stiva doesn't drink... Kostia, stop, what's the matter?' 
                Kitty began, hurrying after him, but he strode ruthlessly away 
                to the dining room without waiting for her, and at once joined 
                in the lively general conversation which was being maintained 
                there by Vassenka Veslovsky and Stepan Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> `Well, what do you say, are we going shooting tomorrow?' said 
                Stepan Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> `Please, do let's go,' said Veslovsky, moving to another chair, 
                where he sat down sideways, with one fat leg crossed under him. 
              </p>
              <p> `I shall be delighted, we will go. And have you had any shooting 
                yet this year?' said Levin to Veslovsky, looking intently at his 
                leg, but speaking with that forced amiability that Kitty knew 
                so well in him, and that was so out of keeping with him. `I can't 
                answer for our finding double snipe, but there are plenty of jacksnipe. 
                Only we ought to start early. You're not tired? Aren't you tired, 
                Stiva?' </p>
              <p> `Me tired? I've never been tired yet. Suppose we stay up all 
                night. Let's go for a walk!' </p>
              <p> `Yes, really, let's not go to bed at all! Capital!' Veslovsky 
                chimed in. </p>
              <p> `Oh, we all know you can do without sleep, and keep other people 
                up too,' Dolly said to her husband, with that faint note of irony 
                in her voice which she almost always had now with her husband. 
                `But to my thinking, it's time for bed now... I'm going, I don't 
                want supper.' </p>
              <p> `No, do stay a little, Dollenka,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, going 
                round to her side behind the table where they were having supper. 
                `I've so much still to tell you.' </p>
              <p> `Nothing really, I suppose.' </p>
              <p> `Do you know Veslovsky has been at Anna's, and he's going to 
                them again? You know they're hardly seventy verstas from you, 
                and I too must certainly go over there. Veslovsky, come here!' 
              </p>
              <p> Vassenka crossed over to the ladies, and sat down beside Kitty. 
              </p>
              <p> `Ah, do tell me, please; you have visited her? How was she?' 
                Darya Alexandrovna appealed to him. </p>
              <p> Levin was left at the other end of the table, and though never 
                pausing in his conversation with the Princess and Varenka, he 
                saw that there was an eager and mysterious conversation going 
                on between Stepan Arkadyevich, Dolly, Kitty, and Veslovsky. And 
                that was not all. He saw on his wife's face an expression of real 
                feeling as she gazed with fixed eyes on the handsome face of Vassenka, 
                who was telling them something with great animation. </p>
              <p> `It's exceedingly nice at their place,' Veslovsky was telling 
                them about Vronsky and Anna. `I can't, of course, take it upon 
                myself to judge, but in their house you feel the real feeling 
                of home.' </p>
              <p> `What do they intend doing?' </p>
              <p> `I believe they think of going to Moscow for the winter.' </p>
              <p> `How jolly it would be for us all to go over to them together! 
                When are you going there?' Stepan Arkadyevich asked Vassenka. 
              </p>
              <p> `I'm spending July there.' </p>
              <p> `Will you go?' Stepan Arkadyevich said to his wife. </p>
              <p> `I've been wanting to a long while; I shall certainly go,' said 
                Dolly. `I am sorry for her, and I know her. She's a splendid woman. 
                I will go alone, when you go back, and then I shall be in no one's 
                way. And it will be better indeed without you.' </p>
              <p> `To be sure,' said Stepan Arkadyevich. `And you, Kitty?' </p>
              <p> `I? Why should I go?' Kitty said, flushing all over, and she 
                glanced round at her husband. </p>
              <p> `Do you know Anna Arkadyevna, then?' Veslovsky asked her. `She's 
                a very fascinating woman?' </p>
              <p> `Yes,' she answered Veslovsky, crimsoning still more. She got 
                up and walked across to her husband. </p>
              <p> `Are you going shooting, then, tomorrow?' she said. </p>
              <p> His jealousy had in these few moments, especially at the flush 
                that had overspread her cheeks while she was talking to Veslovsky, 
                gone far indeed. Now as he heard her words, he construed them 
                in his own fashion. Strange as it was to him afterward to recall 
                it, it seemed to him at the moment clear that in asking whether 
                he was going shooting, all she cared to know was whether he would 
                give that pleasure to Vassenka Veslovsky, with whom, as he fancied, 
                she was in love. </p>
              <p> `Yes, I'm going,' he answered her in an unnatural voice, disagreeable 
                to himself. </p>
              <p> `No, better spend the day here tomorrow, or Dolly won't see 
                anything of her husband, and set off the day after,' said Kitty. 
              </p>
              <p> The motive of Kitty's words was interpreted by Levin thus: `Don't 
                separate me from him. I don't care about your going, but do let 
                me enjoy the society of this delightful young man.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, if you wish, we'll stay here tomorrow,' Levin answered, 
                with peculiar amiability. </p>
              <p> Vassenka meanwhile, utterly unsuspecting the misery his presence 
                had occasioned, got up from the table after Kitty, and watching 
                her with smiling and admiring eyes, he followed her. </p>
              <p> Levin saw that look. He turned white, and for a minute he could 
                hardly breathe. `How dare he look at my wife like that!' was the 
                feeling that boiled within him. </p>
              <p> `Tomorrow, then? Do, please, let us go,' said Vassenka, sitting 
                down on a chair, and again crossing his leg as his habit was. 
              </p>
              <p> Levin's jealousy went further still. Already he saw himself 
                a deceived husband, looked upon by his wife and her lover as simply 
                necessary to provide them with the conveniences and pleasures 
                of life.... But in spite of that he made polite and hospitable 
                inquiries of Vassenka about his shooting, his gun, and his boots, 
                and agreed to go shooting next day. </p>
              <p> Happily for Levin, the old Princess cut short his agonies by 
                getting up herself and advising Kitty to go to bed. But even at 
                this point Levin could not escape another agony. As he said good 
                night to his hostess, Vassenka would again have kissed her hand, 
                but Kitty, reddening, drew back her hand and said with a na?ve 
                bluntness, for which the old Princess scolded her afterward: </p>
              <p> `We don't like that fashion.' </p>
              <p> In Levin's eyes she was to blame for having allowed such relations 
                to arise, and still more to blame for showing so awkwardly that 
                she did not like them. </p>
              <p> `Why, how can one want to go to bed!' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                who, after drinking several glasses of wine at supper, was now 
                in his most charming and lyrical humor. `Look, Kitty,' he said, 
                pointing to the moon, which had just risen behind the linden trees, 
                `how exquisite! Veslovsky, this is the time for a serenade. You 
                know, he has a splendid voice; we practised songs together along 
                the road. He has brought some lovely songs with him - two new 
                ones. Varvara Andreevna and he must sing some duets.' </p>
              <p> When the party had broken up, Stepan Arkadyevich walked a long 
                while about the avenue with Veslovsky; their voices could be heard 
                singing one of the new songs. </p>
              <p> Levin, hearing these voices, sat scowling in an easy chair in 
                his wife's bedroom, and maintained an obstinate silence when she 
                asked him what was wrong. But when at last with a timid glance 
                she hazarded the question: `Was there perhaps something you disliked 
                about Veslovsky?' - it all burst out, and he told her all. He 
                was hurt himself by what he was saying, and that exasperated him 
                all the more. </p>
              <p> He stood facing her with his eyes glittering menacingly under 
                his scowling brows, and he squeezed his strong arms across his 
                chest, as though he were straining every nerve to hold himself 
                in. The expression of his face would have been grim, and even 
                cruel, if it had not at the same time had a look of suffering 
                which touched her. His jaws were twitching, and his voice kept 
                breaking. </p>
              <p> `You must understand that I'm not jealous, that's a nasty word. 
                I can't be jealous, and believe that... I can't say what I feel, 
                but this is awful... I'm not jealous, but I'm wounded, humiliated 
                that anybody dare think, that anybody dare look at you with eyes 
                like that....' </p>
              <p> `Eyes like what?' said Kitty, trying as conscientiously as possible 
                to recall every word and gesture of that evening and every shade 
                implied in them. </p>
              <p> At the very bottom of her heart she did think there had been 
                something, precisely at the moment when he had crossed over after 
                her to the other end of the table; but she dared not own it even 
                to herself, and would have been even more unable to bring herself 
                to say so to him, and so increase his suffering. </p>
              <p> `And what can there possibly be attractive about me as I am 
                now?...' </p>
              <p> `Ah!' he cried, clutching at his head, `You shouldn't say that!... 
                If you had been attractive, then...' </p>
              <p> `Oh, no, Kostia, oh, wait a minute, oh, do listen!' she said, 
                looking at him with an expression of pained commiseration. `Why, 
                what can you be thinking about! When for me there's no one in 
                the world, no one, no one!... Would you like me never to see anyone? 
              </p>
              <p> For the first minute she had been offended at his jealousy; 
                she was angry that the slightest amusement, even the most innocent, 
                should be forbidden her; but now she would readily have sacrificed, 
                not merely such trifles, but everything, for his peace of mind, 
                to save him from the agony he was suffering. </p>
              <p> `You must understand the horror and comedy of my position,' 
                he went on in a desperate whisper; `that he's in my house, that 
                he's done nothing positively improper - one can take exception 
                only to his free and easy airs and the way he tucks his legs in 
                under him. He thinks it's the best possible form, and so I'm obliged 
                to be civil to him.' </p>
              <p> `But, Kostia, you're exaggerating,' said Kitty, at the bottom 
                of her heart rejoicing at the depth of his love for her, shown 
                now in his jealousy. </p>
              <p> `The most awful part of it all is that you're just as you always 
                are, and especially now when to me you're something sacred, and 
                we're so happy, so particularly happy - and all of a sudden a 
                little wretch... He's not a little wretch; why should I abuse 
                him? I have nothing to do with him. But why should my, and your, 
                happiness...' </p>
              <p> `Do you know, I understand now what it all came from,' Kitty 
                was beginning. </p>
              <p> `Well, what? What?' </p>
              <p> `I saw how you looked while we were talking at supper.' </p>
              <p> `Well, well!' Levin said in dismay. </p>
              <p> She told him what they had been talking about. And as she told 
                him, she was breathless with emotion. Levin was silent for a space, 
                then he scanned her pale and distressed face, and suddenly he 
                clutched at his head. </p>
              <p> `Katia, I've been worrying you! Darling, forgive me! It's madness! 
                Katia, I'm a criminal. And how could you be so distressed at such 
                idiocy?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, I was sorry for you.' </p>
              <p> `For me? For me? How mad I am!... But why make you miserable? 
                It's awful to think that any outsider can shatter our happiness.' 
              </p>
              <p> `It's humiliating too, of course.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, then I'll keep him here all the summer, and will overwhelm 
                him with civility,' said Levin, kissing her hands. `You shall 
                see. Tomorrow... oh, yes, we are going tomorrow.' </p>

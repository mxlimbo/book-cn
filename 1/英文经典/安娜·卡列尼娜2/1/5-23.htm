              <p><br>
                The Countess Lidia Ivanovna had, as a very young and enthusiastic 
                girl, been married to a wealthy man of high rank, a very good-natured, 
                jovial, and extremely dissipated rake. One month after marriage 
                her husband abandoned her, and her enthusiastic protestations 
                of affection he met with an irony and even hostility which people, 
                knowing the Count's good heart, and seeing no defects in the enthusiastic 
                Lidia, were at a loss to explain. Though they were divorced and 
                lived apart, yet whenever the husband met the wife, he invariably 
                behaved to her with the same malignant irony, the cause of which 
                was incomprehensible. </p>
              <p>Countess Lidia Ivanovna had long given up being in love with 
                her husband, but from that time she had never given up being in 
                love with someone. She was in love with several people at once, 
                both men and women; she had been in love with almost everyone 
                who had been particularly distinguished in any way. She was in 
                love with all the new princes and princesses who married into 
                the Imperial family; she had been in love with one archbishop, 
                one vicar, and one parish priest; she had been in love with one 
                journalist, three Slavophils, with Komissarov, with one minister, 
                one doctor, one English missionary, and Karenin. All these passions, 
                constantly waning or growing more ardent, did not prevent her 
                from keeping up the most extended and complicated relations with 
                the Court and fashionable society. But from the time that, after 
                Karenin's trouble, she had taken him under special protection, 
                from the time that she had set to work in Karenin's household 
                looking after his welfare, she felt that all her other attachments 
                were not the real thing, and that she was now genuinely in love, 
                and with no one but Karenin. The feeling she now experienced for 
                him seemed to her stronger than any of her former feelings. Analyzing 
                her feeling, and comparing it with former passions, she distinctly 
                perceived that she would not have been in love with Komissarov 
                if he had not saved the life of the Czar; that she would not have 
                been in love with Ristich-Kudzhitsky if there had been no Slavonic 
                question; but that she loved Karenin for himself, for his lofty, 
                uncomprehended soul, for the sweet - to her - high notes of his 
                voice, for his drawling intonation, his weary eyes, his character, 
                and his soft white hands with their swollen veins. She was not 
                simply overjoyed at meeting him, but she sought in his face signs 
                of the impression she was making on him. She tried to please him, 
                not by her words only, but in her whole person. For his sake it 
                was that she now lavished more care on her dress than before. 
                She caught herself in reveries on what might have been, if she 
                had not been married and he had been free. She blushed with emotion 
                when he came into the room, she could not repress a smile of rapture 
                when he said anything amiable to her. </p>
              <p> For several days now Countess Lidia Ivanovna had been in a state 
                of intense excitement. She had learned that Anna and Vronsky were 
                in Peterburg. Alexei Alexandrovich must be saved from seeing her, 
                he must be saved even from the torturing knowledge that that awful 
                woman was in the same town with him, and that he might meet her 
                any minute. </p>
              <p> Lidia Ivanovna made inquiries through her friends as to what 
                those shocking people, as she called Anna and Vronsky, intended 
                doing, and she endeavored so to guide every movement of her friend 
                during those days that he might not come across them. The young 
                adjutant, a friend of Vronsky, through whom she obtained her information, 
                and who hoped through Countess Lidia Ivanovna to obtain a concession, 
                told her that they had finished their business and were going 
                away next day. Lidia Ivanovna had already begun to calm down, 
                when the next morning a note was brought her, the handwriting 
                of which she recognized with horror. It was the handwriting of 
                Anna Karenina. The envelope was of paper as thick as bast; on 
                the oblong yellow paper there was a huge monogram, and the letter 
                smelt of agreeable scent. </p>
              <p> `Who brought it?' </p>
              <p> `A commissionaire from the hotel.' </p>
              <p> It was some time before Countess Lidia Ivanovna could sit down 
                to read the letter. Her excitement brought on an attack of asthma, 
                to which she was subject. When she had recovered her composure, 
                she read the following letter in French: </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>`MADAME LA COMTESSE - The Christian feelings with which your 
                heart is filled give me the, I feel, unpardonable boldness to 
                write to you. I am miserable at being separated from my son. I 
                entreat permission to see him once before my departure. Forgive 
                me for recalling myself to your memory. I apply to you and not 
                to Alexei Alexandrovich, simply because I do not wish to cause 
                that generous man to suffer in remembering me. Knowing your friendship 
                for him, I know you will understand me. Could you send Seriozha 
                to me, or should I come to the house at some fixed hour, or will 
                you let me know when and where I could see him away from home? 
                I do not anticipate a refusal, knowing the magnanimity of him 
                with whom it rests. You cannot conceive the craving I have to 
                see him, and so cannot conceive the gratitude your help will arouse 
                in me. <br>
              </p>
              <p>ANNA'<br>
                Everything in this letter exasperated Countess Lidia Ivanovna: 
                its contents, and the allusion to magnanimity, and especially 
                its free and easy - as she considered - tone. <br>
                `Say that there is no answer,' said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, and 
                immediately opening her blotting book, she wrote to Alexei Alexandrovich 
                that she hoped to see him at one o'clock at the levee. </p>
              <p> `I must talk with you of a grave and painful subject. There 
                we will arrange where to meet. Best of all at my house, where 
                I will order tea as you like it. Urgent. He lays the cross, but 
                He gives the strength to bear it,' she added, so as to give him 
                some slight preparation. </p>
              <p> Countess Lidia Ivanovna usually wrote some two or three letters 
                a day to Alexei Alexandrovich. She enjoyed that form of communication, 
                which gave opportunity for a refinement and air of mystery not 
                afforded by their personal interviews. </p>

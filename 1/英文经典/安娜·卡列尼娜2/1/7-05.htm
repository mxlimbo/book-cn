              <p><br>
                At the concert in the afternoon two very interesting things were 
                performed. <br>
                One was a fantasia, King Lear in the Heath; the other was a quartette 
                dedicated to the memory of Bach. Both were new and in the new 
                style, and Levin was eager to form an opinion of them. After escorting 
                his sister-in-law to her stall, he stood against a column and 
                tried to listen as attentively and conscientiously as possible. 
                He tried not to let his attention be distracted, and not to spoil 
                his impression by looking at the conductor in a white tie, waving 
                his arms, which always disturbed his enjoyment of music so much, 
                or the ladies in bonnets, the ribbons of which, since it was a 
                concert, they had carefully tied over their ears, and all these 
                people either thinking of nothing at all, or thinking of all sorts 
                of things except the music. He tried to avoid meeting musical 
                connoisseurs or talkative acquaintances, and stood looking at 
                the floor straight before him, listening. </p>
              <p> But the more he listened to the fantasia of King Lear the further 
                he felt from forming any definite opinion of it. There was, as 
                it were, a continual beginning, a preparation of the musical expression 
                of some feeling, but it fell to pieces again directly, breaking 
                into new musical motifs, or simply nothing but the whims of the 
                composer - exceedingly complex but disconnected sounds. And these 
                fragmentary musical expressions, though sometimes beautiful, were 
                disagreeable, because they were utterly unexpected and not led 
                up to by anything. Gaiety and grief and despair and tenderness 
                and triumph followed one another without any ground, like the 
                emotions of a madman. And those emotions, like a madman's, sprang 
                up quite unexpectedly. </p>
              <p> During the whole performance Levin felt like a deaf man watching 
                people dancing, and was in a state of complete bewilderment when 
                the fantasia was over, and felt a great weariness from the fruitless 
                strain on his attention. Loud applause resounded on all sides. 
                Everyone got up, moved about, and began talking. Anxious to throw 
                some light on his own perplexity from the impressions of others, 
                Levin began to walk about, looking for connoisseurs, and was glad 
                to see a well-known musical amateur in conversation with Pestsov, 
                whom he knew. </p>
              <p> `Marvelous!' Pestsov was saying in his deep bass. `How are you, 
                Konstantin Dmitrievich? Particularly sculpturesque and plastic, 
                so to say, and richly colored is that passage where you feel Cordelia's 
                approach, where woman, das ewig Weibliche, enters into conflict 
                with fate. Isn't it?' </p>
              <p> `You mean... What has Cordelia to do with it?' Levin asked timidly, 
                forgetting that the fantasia was supposed to represent King Lear. 
              </p>
              <p> `Cordelia comes in... See here!' said Pestsov, tapping his finger 
                on the satiny surface of the program he held in his hand and passing 
                it to Levin. </p>
              <p> Only then Levin recollected the title of the fantasia, and made 
                haste to read in the Russian translation the lines from Shakespeare 
                that were printed on the back of the program. </p>
              <p> `You can't follow it without that,' said Pestsov, addressing 
                Levin, as the person he had been speaking to had gone away, and 
                he had no one to talk to. </p>
              <p> In the entr'acte Levin and Pestsov fell into an argument upon 
                the merits and defects of the music of the Wagner school. Levin 
                maintained that the mistake of Wagner and all his followers lay 
                in their trying to take music into the sphere of another art, 
                just as poetry goes wrong when it tries to paint a face as the 
                art of painting ought to do, and as an instance of this mistake 
                he cited the sculptor who carved in marble certain poetic phantasms 
                flitting round the figure of the poet on the pedestal. `These 
                phantoms were so far from being phantoms that they were positively 
                clinging to the stairs,' said Levin. The comparison pleased him, 
                but he could not remember whether he had not used the same phrase 
                before, and to Pestsov, too, and as he said it he felt confused. 
              </p>
              <p> Pestsov maintained that art is one, and that it can attain its 
                highest manifestations only by the conjunction of all kinds of 
                art. </p>
              <p> The second piece that was performed Levin could not hear. Pestsov, 
                who was standing beside him, was talking to him almost all the 
                time, condemning the music for its excessive affected assumption 
                of simplicity, and comparing it with the simplicity of the Pre-Raphaelites 
                in painting. As he went out Levin met many more acquaintances, 
                with whom he talked of politics, of music, and of common acquaintances. 
                Among others he met Count Bol, whom he had utterly forgotten to 
                call upon. </p>
              <p> `Well, go at once then,' Madame Lvova said, when he told her; 
                `perhaps they'll not be at home, and then you can come to the 
                meeting to fetch me. You'll find me still there.' </p>

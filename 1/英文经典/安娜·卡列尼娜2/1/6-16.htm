              <p><br>
                Darya Alexandrovna carried out her intention and went to see Anna. 
                She was sorry to annoy her sister and to do anything Levin disliked. 
                She quite understood how right the Levins were in not wishing 
                to have anything to do with Vronsky. But she felt she must go 
                and see Anna, and show her that her feelings could not be changed, 
                in spite of the change in her position. </p>
              <p>That she might be independent of the Levins in this expedition, 
                Darya Alexandrovna sent to the village to hire horses for the 
                drive; but Levin learning of it went to her to protest. </p>
              <p> `What makes you suppose that I dislike your going? But, even 
                if did dislike it, I should still more dislike your not taking 
                my horses,' he said. `You never told me that you were going definitely. 
                Hiring horses in the village is disagreeable to me, and, what's 
                of more importance, they'll undertake the job and never get you 
                there. I have horses. And if you don't want to wound me, you'll 
                take mine.' </p>
              <p> Darya Alexandrovna had to consent, and on the day fixed Levin 
                had ready for his sister-in-law a set of four horses and relays, 
                getting them together from the farm and saddle horses - not at 
                all a smart-looking set, but capable of taking Darya Alexandrovna 
                the whole distance in a single day. At that moment, when horses 
                were wanted for the Princess, who was going, and for the midwife, 
                it was a difficult matter for Levin to make up the number, but 
                the duties of hospitality would not let him allow Darya Alexandrovna 
                to hire horses when staying in his house. Moreover, he was well 
                aware that the twenty roubles that would be asked for the journey 
                were a serious matter for her; Darya Alexandrovna's pecuniary 
                affairs, which were in a very unsatisfactory state, were taken 
                to heart by the Levins as if they were their own. </p>
              <p> Darya Alexandrovna, by Levin's advice, started before daybreak. 
                The road was good, the carriage comfortable, the horses trotted 
                along merrily, and on the box, beside the coachman, sat the countinghouse 
                clerk, whom Levin was sending instead of a groom for greater security. 
                Darya Alexandrovna dozed and waked up only on reaching the inn 
                where the horses were to be changed. </p>
              <p> After drinking tea at the same well-to-do peasant's with whom 
                Levin had stayed on the way to Sviiazhsky's, and chatting with 
                the women about their children, and with the old man about Count 
                Vronsky, whom the latter praised very highly, Darya Alexandrovna, 
                at ten o'clock, went on again. At home, looking after her children, 
                she had no time to think. So now, after this journey of four hours, 
                all the thoughts she had suppressed before rushed swarming into 
                her brain, and she thought over all her life as she never had 
                before, and from the most different points of view. Her thoughts 
                seemed strange even to herself. At first she thought about the 
                children, about whom she was uneasy, although the Princess and 
                Kitty (she reckoned more upon her) had promised to look after 
                them. `If only Masha does not begin her naughty tricks, if Grisha 
                isn't kicked by a horse, and Lily's stomach isn't upset again!' 
                But these questions of the present were succeeded by questions 
                of the immediate future. She began thinking how she had to get 
                a new flat in Moscow for the coming winter, to renew the drawing-room 
                furniture, and to make her elder girl a cloak. Then questions 
                of the more remote future occurred to her: how she was to place 
                her children in the world. `The girls are all right,' she thought; 
                `but the boys?' </p>
              <p> `It's all very fine for me to be teaching Grisha, but of course 
                that's only because I am free myself now, I'm not with child. 
                Stiva, of course, there's no counting on. And with the help of 
                good-natured friends I can bring them up; but if there's another 
                baby coming?...' And the thought struck her how unjustly it was 
                said, that the curse laid on woman was that in sorrow she should 
                bring forth children. `The birth itself, that's nothing; but the 
                months of carrying the child - that's what's so intolerable,' 
                she thought, picturing to herself her last pregnancy, and the 
                death of the last baby. And she recalled the conversation she 
                had just had with the young woman at the inn. On being asked whether 
                she had any children, the handsome young woman had answered cheerfully. 
              </p>
              <p> `I had a girl baby, but God set me free; I buried her last Lent.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, did you grieve very much for her?' asked Darya Alexandrovna. 
              </p>
              <p> `Why grieve? The old man has grandchildren enough as it is. 
                It was only a trouble. No working, nor nothing. Only a tie.' </p>
              <p> This answer had struck Darya Alexandrovna as revolting in spite 
                of the good-natured and pleasing face of the young woman; but 
                now she could not help recalling these words. In those cynical 
                words there was indeed a grain of truth. </p>
              <p> `Yes, in general,' thought Darya Alexandrovna, looking back 
                over her whole existence during those fifteen years of her married 
                life, `pregnancy, sickness, mental incapacity, indifference to 
                everything - and, most of all, hideousness. Kitty, young and pretty 
                as she is, even Kitty has lost her looks; and I, when I'm with 
                child, become hideous, I know it. The birth, the agony, the hideous 
                agonies, that last moment... Then the nursing, the sleepless nights, 
                the fearful pains...' </p>
              <p> Darya Alexandrovna shuddered at the mere recollection of the 
                pain from sore breasts which she had suffered with almost every 
                child. `Then the children's illnesses, that everlasting apprehension; 
                then bringing them up; evil propensities' (she thought of little 
                Masha's crime among the raspberries), `education, Latin - it's 
                all so incomprehensible and difficult. And, on the top of it all, 
                the death of these children.' And there rose again before her 
                imagination the cruel memory that always tore her mother's heart, 
                of the death of her last little baby, who had died of croup; his 
                funeral, the callous indifference of all at the little pink coffin, 
                and her own torn heart, and her lonely anguish at the sight of 
                the pale little brow with the curls falling on temples, and the 
                open, wondering little mouth seen in the coffin at the moment 
                when it was being covered with the little pink lid with a gallooned 
                cross on it. </p>
              <p> `And all this - what's it for? What is to come of it all? This: 
                I'm wasting my life, never having a moment's peace, either with 
                child, or nursing a child, forever irritable, peevish, wretched 
                myself and worrying others, repulsive to my husband, while the 
                children are growing up unhappy, badly educated and penniless. 
                Even now, if it weren't for spending the summer at the Levins', 
                I don't know how we should be managing to live. Of course Kostia 
                and Kitty have so much tact that we don't feel it; but it can't 
                go on. They'll have children, they won't be able to keep us; it's 
                a drag on them as it is. How is papa, who has hardly anything 
                left for himself, to help us? So that I can't even bring the children 
                up by myself, and may find it hard with the help of other people, 
                at the cost of humiliation. Why, even if we suppose the greatest 
                good luck, that the children don't die, and I bring them up somehow. 
                At the very best they'll simply be decent people. That's all I 
                can hope for. And to gain simply that - what agonies, what toil!... 
                One's whole life ruined!' Again she recalled what the young peasant 
                woman had said, and again she was revolted at the thought; but 
                she could not help admitting that there was a grain of brutal 
                truth in the words. </p>
              <p> `Is it far now, Mikhaila?' Darya Alexandrovna asked the countinghouse 
                clerk, to turn her mind from thoughts that were frightening her. 
              </p>
              <p> `From this village, they say, it's seven verstas.' </p>
              <p> The carriage drove along the village street and onto a bridge. 
                On the bridge was a crowd of peasant women with coils of ties 
                for the sheaves on their shoulders, cheerfully chattering. They 
                stood still on the bridge, staring inquisitively at the carriage. 
                All the faces turned to Darya Alexandrovna looked to her healthy 
                and happy, making her envious of their enjoyment of life. `They're 
                all living, they're all enjoying life,' Darya Alexandrovna still 
                mused when she had passed the peasant women and was driving uphill 
                again at a trot, seated comfortably on the soft springs of the 
                old carriage, `while I, let out, as it were from prison, from 
                the world of worries that fret me to death, am only looking about 
                me now for an instant. They all live; those peasant women, and 
                my sister Natalie, and Varenka, and Anna, whom I am going to see 
                - all, but not I.' </p>
              <p> `And they attack Anna. What for? Am I any better? I have, at 
                any rate, a husband I love - not as I should like to love him 
                - still, I do love him; while Anna never loved hers. How is she 
                to blame? She wants to live. God has put that in our hearts. Very 
                likely I should have done the same. Even to this day I don't feel 
                sure I did right in listening to her at that terrible time when 
                she came to me in Moscow. I ought then to have cast off my husband 
                and have begun my life anew. I might have loved and have been 
                loved in reality. And is it any better as it is? I don't respect 
                him. He's necessary to me,' she thought about her husband, `and 
                I put up with him. Is that any better? At that time I could still 
                have been admired, I had beauty left me still,' Darya Alexandrovna 
                pursued her thoughts, and she would have liked to look at herself 
                in the looking glass. She had a traveling looking glass in her 
                handbag, and she wanted to take it out; but looking at the backs 
                of the coachman and the swaying countinghouse clerk, she felt 
                that she would be ashamed if either of them were to look round, 
                and she did not take out the glass. </p>
              <p> But, without looking in the glass, she thought that even now 
                it was not too late; and she thought of Sergei Ivanovich, who 
                was always particularly attentive to her, of Stiva's goodhearted 
                friend, Turovtsin, who had helped her nurse her children through 
                the scarlatina, and was in love with her. And there was someone 
                else, quite a young man, who - her husband had told her it as 
                a joke - thought her more beautiful than either of her sisters. 
                And the most passionate and impossible romances rose before Darya 
                Alexandrovna's imagination. `Anna did quite right, and certainly 
                I shall never reproach her for it. She is happy, she makes another 
                person happy, and she's not broken down as I am, but most likely 
                just as she always was, bright, clever, open to every impression,' 
                thought Darya Alexandrovna - and a sly smile curved her lips, 
                for, as she pondered on Anna's love affair, Darya Alexandrovna 
                constructed on parallel lines an almost identical love affair 
                for herself, with an imaginary composite figure, the ideal man 
                who was in love with her. She, like Anna, confessed the whole 
                affair to her husband. And the amazement and perplexity of Stepan 
                Arkadyevich at this avowal made her smile. </p>
              <p> In such daydreams she reached the turning of the highroad that 
                led to Vozdivzhenskoe. </p>

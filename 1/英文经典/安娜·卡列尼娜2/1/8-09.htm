                These doubts fretted and harassed him, growing weaker or stronger 
                from time to time, but never leaving him. He read and thought, 
                and the more he read and the more he thought, the further he felt 
                from the aim he was pursuing. </p>
              <p>Of late in Moscow and in the country, since he had become convinced 
                that he would find no solution in the materialists, he had read 
                and reread thoroughly Plato, Spinoza, Kant, Schelling, Hegel, 
                and Schopenhauer - those philosophers who gave a nonmaterialistic 
                explanation of life. </p>
              <p> Their ideas seemed to him fruitful when he was reading or was 
                himself seeking arguments to refute other theories, especially 
                those of the materialists; but as soon as he began to read or 
                sought for himself a solution of problems, the same thing always 
                happened. As long as he followed the fixed definition of vague 
                words such as spirit, will, freedom, substance, purposely letting 
                himself go into the snare of words the philosophers, or he himself, 
                set for him, he seemed to comprehend something. But he had only 
                to forget the artificial train of reasoning, and to turn from 
                life itself to what had satisfied him while thinking in accordance 
                with the fixed definitions, and all this artificial edifice fell 
                to pieces at once like a house of cards, and it became clear that 
                the edifice had been built up out of those transposed words, apart 
                from a something in life that was more important than reason. 
              </p>
              <p> At one time, reading Schopenhauer, he put in place of his will 
                the word love, and for a couple of days this new philosophy consoled 
                him, till he removed away from it. But then, when he turned from 
                life itself to glance at it again, it fell away too, and proved 
                to be the same muslin garment with no warmth in it. </p>
              <p> His brother Sergei Ivanovich advised him to read the theological 
                works of Khomiakov. Levin read the second volume of Khomiakov's 
                works, and in spite of the elegant, epigrammatic, polemic style 
                which at first repelled him, he was impressed by the doctrine 
                of the church he found in them. He was struck at first by the 
                idea that the apprehension of divine truths had not been vouchsafed 
                to man, but to a corporation of men bound together by love - to 
                Church. What delighted him was the thought how much easier it 
                was to believe in a still existing living Church, embracing all 
                the beliefs of men, and having God at its head, and therefore 
                holy and infallible, and from it to accept the faith in God, in 
                the creation, the fall, the redemption, than to begin with God, 
                a mysterious, faraway God, the creation, etc. But afterward, on 
                reading a Catholic writer's history of the Church, and then a 
                Greek orthodox writer's history of the Church, and seeing that 
                the two Churches, in their very conception infallible, each deny 
                the authority of the other, Khomiakov's doctrine of the Church 
                lost all its charm for him, and this edifice crumbled into dust 
                like the philosophers' edifices. </p>
              <p> All that spring he was not himself, and went through fearful 
                moments of horror. </p>
              <p> `Without knowing what I am and why I am here, life's impossible; 
                and that I can't know, and so I can't live,' Levin said to himself. 
              </p>
              <p> `In infinite time, in infinite matter, in infinite space, is 
                formed a bubble organism, and that bubble lasts a while and bursts, 
                and that bubble is Me.' </p>
              <p> It was an agonizing error, but it was the sole logical result 
                of ages of human thought in that direction. </p>
              <p> This was the ultimate belief on which all the systems elaborated 
                by human thought, in almost all their ramifications, rested. It 
                was the prevalent conviction, and of all other explanations Levin 
                had unconsciously, not knowing when or how, chosen it, as the 
                clearest at any rate, and made it his own. </p>
              <p> But it was not merely a falsehood, it was the cruel jeer of 
                some wicked power, some evil, hateful power, to whom one could 
                not submit. </p>
              <p> He must escape from this power. And the means of escape every 
                man had in his own hands. He had but to cut short this dependence 
                on evil. And there was one means - death. </p>
              <p> And Levin, a happy father and a man in perfect health, was several 
                times so near suicide that he hid the cord, lest he be tempted 
                to hang himself, and was afraid to go out with his gun, for fear 
                of shooting himself. </p>
              <p> But Levin did not shoot himself, and did not hang himself; he 
                went on living. </p>

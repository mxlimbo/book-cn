              <p><br>
                After the lesson with the teacher of grammar came his father's 
                lesson. While waiting for his father, Seriozha sat at the table 
                playing with a penknife, and fell to musing. Among Seriozha's 
                favorite occupations was searching for his mother during his walks. 
                He did not believe in death generally, and in her death in particular, 
                in spite of what Lidia Ivanovna had told him and his father had 
                confirmed, and it was just because of that, and after he had been 
                told she was dead, that he had begun looking for her when out 
                for a walk. Every woman of full, graceful figure with dark hair 
                was his mother. At the sight of such a woman such a feeling of 
                tenderness stirred within him that his breath failed him, and 
                tears came into his eyes. And he was on tiptoe with expectation 
                that she would come up to him, would lift her veil. All her face 
                would be visible, she would smile, she would hug him, he would 
                sniff her fragrance, feel the softness of her arms, and cry with 
                happiness, just as he had one evening lain on her lap while she 
                tickled him, and he laughed and bit her white, ring-covered fingers. 
                Later, when he accidentally learned from his old nurse that his 
                mother was not dead, and his father and Lidia Ivanovna had explained 
                to him that she was dead to him because she was wicked (which 
                he could not possibly believe, because he loved her), he went 
                on seeking her and expecting her in the same way. That day in 
                the public gardens there had been a lady in a lilac veil, whom 
                he had watched with a throbbing heart, believing it to be her 
                as she came toward them along the path. The lady had not come 
                up to them, but had disappeared somewhere. That day, more intensely 
                than ever, Seriozha felt a rush of love for her, and now, waiting 
                for his father, he forgot everything, and cut all round the edge 
                of the table with his penknife, staring straight before him with 
                sparkling eyes, and thinking of her. <br>
                `Here is your papa,' Vassilii Lukich diverted him. </p>
              <p> Seriozha jumped up and went up to his father, and, kissing his 
                hand, looked at him intently, trying to discover signs of his 
                joy at receiving the Alexandre Nevsky. </p>
              <p> `Did you have a good walk?' said Alexei Alexandrovich, sitting 
                down in his easy chair, pulling the volume of the Old Testament 
                to him and opening it. Although Alexei Alexandrovich had more 
                than once told Seriozha that every Christian ought to know Scripture 
                history thoroughly, he often referred to the Bible himself during 
                the lesson, and Seriozha observed this. </p>
              <p> `Yes, it was very good indeed, papa,' said Seriozha, sitting 
                sideways on his chair and rocking it, which was forbidden. `I 
                saw Nadinka' (Nadinka was a niece of Lidia Ivanovna's who was 
                being brought up in her house). `She told me you'd been given 
                a new star. Are you glad, papa?' </p>
              <p> `First of all, don't rock your chair, please,' said Alexei Alexandrovich. 
                `And secondly, it's not the reward that's precious, but the work 
                itself. And I could have wished you had understood that. If you 
                now are going to work, to study, in order to win a reward, then 
                the work will seem hard to you; but when you work' (Alexei Alexandrovich, 
                as he spoke, thought of how he had been sustained by a sense of 
                duty through the wearisome labor of the morning, consisting of 
                signing one hundred and eighty papers), `loving your work, you 
                will find your reward for it.' </p>
              <p> Seriozha's eyes hitherto shining with gaiety and tenderness, 
                grew dull and dropped before his father's gaze. This was the same 
                long-familiar tone his father always took with him, and Seriozha 
                had learned by now to fall in with it. His father always talked 
                to him - so Seriozha felt - as though he were addressing some 
                boy of his own imagination, one of those boys who exist in books, 
                utterly unlike himself. And Seriozha always tried, before his 
                father, to pretend being this storybook boy. </p>
              <p> `You understand that, I hope?' said his father. </p>
              <p> `Yes, papa,' answered Seriozha, acting the part of the imaginary 
                boy. </p>
              <p> The lesson consisted of learning by heart several verses out 
                of the Evangel and the repetition of the beginning of the Old 
                Testament. The verses from the Evangel Seriozha knew fairly well, 
                but at the moment when he was saying them he became so absorbed 
                in watching the sharply protruding, bony knobbiness of his father's 
                forehead, that he lost the thread, and he transposed the end of 
                one verse and the beginning of another. It was evident to Alexei 
                Alexandrovich that he did not understand what he was saying, and 
                this irritated him. </p>
              <p> He frowned, and began explaining what Seriozha had heard many 
                times before and never could remember, because he understood it 
                too well, just as that `suddenly' is an adverb of manner of action. 
                Seriozha looked with scared eyes at his father, and could think 
                of nothing but whether his father would make him repeat what he 
                had said, as he sometimes did. And this thought so alarmed Seriozha 
                that he now understood nothing. But his father did not make him 
                repeat it, and passed on to the lesson out of the Old Testament. 
                Seriozha recounted the events themselves well enough, but when 
                he had to answer questions as to what certain events prefigured, 
                he knew nothing, though he had already been punished over this 
                lesson. The passage at which he was utterly unable to say anything, 
                and began fidgeting and cutting the table and swinging his chair, 
                was where he had to tell of the patriarchs before the Flood. He 
                did not know one of them, except Enoch, who had been taken up 
                alive to heaven. Last time he had remembered their names, but 
                now he had forgotten them utterly, chiefly because Enoch was the 
                personage he liked best in the whole of the Old Testament, and 
                Enoch's translation to heaven was connected in his mind with a 
                whole long train of thought, in which he became absorbed now while 
                he gazed with fascinated eyes at his father's watch chain and 
                a half-unbuttoned button on his waistcoat. </p>
              <p> In death, of which they talked to him so often, Seriozha disbelieved 
                entirely. He did not believe that those he loved could die, above 
                all that he himself would die. That was to him something utterly 
                inconceivable and impossible. But he had been told all men die; 
                he had asked people, indeed, whom he trusted, and they, too, had 
                confirmed it; his old nurse, too, said the same, though reluctantly. 
                But Enoch had not died, and so it followed that everyone did not 
                die. `And why cannot anyone else so serve God and be taken alive 
                to heaven?' thought Seriozha. Bad people - that is, those Seriozha 
                did not like - might die, but the good might all be like Enoch. 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, what are the names of the patriarchs?' </p>
              <p> `Enoch, Enos-' </p>
              <p> `But you have said that already. This is bad. Seriozha, very 
                bad. If you don't try to learn what is most necessary of all for 
                a Christian,' said his father, getting up, `whatever can interest 
                you? I am displeased with you, and Piotr Ignatich' (this was the 
                chief pedagogue) `is displeased with you.... I shall have to punish 
                you.' </p>
              <p> His father and his teacher were both displeased with Seriozha, 
                and he certainly did learn his lessons very badly. But still it 
                could not be said he was a stupid boy. On the contrary, he was 
                far cleverer than the boys his teacher held up as examples to 
                Seriozha. In his father's opinion, he did not want to learn what 
                he was taught. In reality he could not learn that. He could not, 
                because the claims of his own soul were more binding on him that 
                those claims his father and his teacher made upon him. Those claims 
                were in opposition, and he was in direct conflict with his governors. 
              </p>
              <p> He was nine years old; he was a child; but he knew his own soul, 
                it was precious to him; he guarded it as the eyelid guards the 
                eye, and without the key of love he let no one into his soul. 
                His teachers complained that he would not learn, while his soul 
                was brimming over with thirst for knowledge. And he learned from 
                Kapitonich, from his nurse, from Nadinka, from Vassilii Lukich 
                - but not from his teachers. The spring his father and his teachers 
                reckoned upon to turn their mill wheels had long oozed at another 
                place, and its waters did their work there. </p>
              <p> His father punished Seriozha by not letting him go to see Nadinka, 
                Lidia Ivanovna's niece; but this punishment turned out happily 
                for Seriozha. Vassilii Lukich was in a good humor, and showed 
                him how to make windmills. The whole evening passed over this 
                work and in dreaming how to make a windmill on which he could 
                turn himself - clutching at the wings or tying himself on and 
                whirling round. Of his mother Seriozha did not think all the evening, 
                but, when he had gone to bed, he suddenly remembered her, and 
                prayed in his own words that tomorrow his mother, in time for 
                his birthday, might leave off hiding herself and come to him. 
              </p>
              <p> `Vassilii Lukich, do you know what I prayed for tonight - extra 
                beside the regular things?' </p>
              <p> `That you might learn your lessons better?' </p>
              <p> `No.' </p>
              <p> `Toys?' </p>
              <p> `No. You'll never guess. A splendid thing - but it's a secret. 
                When it comes to pass I'll tell you. Can't you guess?' </p>
              <p> `No, I can't guess. You tell me,' said Vassilii Lukich with 
                a smile, which was rare with him. `Come, lie down, I'm putting 
                out the candle.' </p>
              <p> `Without the candle I can see better what I see and what I prayed 
                for. There! I was almost telling the secret!' said Seriozha, laughing 
                gaily. </p>
              <p> When the candle was taken away, Seriozha heard his mother and 
                felt her presence. She stood over him, and her loving gaze caressed 
                him. But then came windmills - a penknife - everything became 
                confused, and he fell asleep. </p>

              <p><br>
                When Levin thought what he was and what he was living for, he 
                could find no answer to the questions and was reduced to despair; 
                but when he left off questioning himself about it, it seemed as 
                though he knew both what he was and what he was living for, acting 
                and living resolutely and without hesitation; even in these latter 
                days he was far more decided and unhesitating in life than he 
                had ever been. </p>
              <p>When he went back to the country at the beginning of June, he 
                went back also to his usual pursuits. His agriculture, his relations 
                with the peasants and the neighbors, the care of his household, 
                the management of his sister's and brother's property, of which 
                he had the direction, his relations with his wife and kindred, 
                the care of his child, and the new beekeeping hobby he had taken 
                up that spring, filled all his time. </p>
              <p> These things occupied him now, not because he justified them 
                to himself by any sort of general principles, as he had done in 
                former days; on the contrary, disappointed by the failure of his 
                former efforts for the general welfare, and too much occupied 
                with his own thought and the mass of business with which he was 
                burdened from all sides, he had completely given up thinking of 
                the general good, and he busied himself with all this work simply 
                because it seemed to him that he must do what he was doing - that 
                he could not do otherwise. </p>
              <p> In former days - almost from childhood, and increasingly up 
                to full manhood - when he had tried to do anything that would 
                be good for all, for humanity, for Russia, for the whole village, 
                he had noticed that the idea of it had been pleasant, but the 
                work itself had always been incoherent, that then he had never 
                had a full conviction of its absolute necessity, and that the 
                work that had begun by seeming so great, had grown less and less, 
                till it vanished into nothing. But now, since his marriage, when 
                he had begun to confine himself more and more to living for himself, 
                though he experienced no delight at all at the thought of the 
                work he was doing, he felt a complete conviction of its necessity, 
                saw that it succeeded far better than in old days, and that it 
                kept on growing more and more. </p>
              <p> Now, involuntarily it seemed, he cut more and more deeply into 
                the soil like a plough, so that he could not be drawn out without 
                turning aside the furrow. </p>
              <p> To live the same family life as his father and forefathers - 
                that is, in the same condition of culture - and to bring up his 
                children in the same, was incontestably necessary. It was as necessary 
                as dining when one was hungry; and to do this, just as it was 
                necessary to cook dinner, it was necessary to keep the mechanism 
                of agriculture at Pokrovskoe going so as to yield an income. Just 
                as incontestably as it was necessary to repay a debt was it necessary 
                to keep the patrimonial estate in such a condition that his son, 
                when he received it as a heritage, would say `Thank you' to his 
                father as Levin had said `Thank you' to the grandfather for all 
                he had built and planted. And to do this it was necessary to look 
                after the land himself, not to let it, and to breed cattle, manure 
                the fields, and plant timber. </p>
              <p> It was impossible not to look after the affairs of Sergei Ivanovich, 
                of his sister, of all the peasants who came to him for advice 
                and were accustomed to do so - as impossible as to fling down 
                a child one is carrying in one's arms. It was necessary to look 
                after the comfort of his sister-in-law and her children, and of 
                his wife and baby, and it was impossible not to spend with them 
                at least a short time each day. </p>
              <p> And all this, together with shooting and his new beekeeping, 
                filled up the whole of Levin's life, which had no meaning at all 
                for him, when he began to think. </p>
              <p> But besides knowing thoroughly what he had to do, Levin knew 
                in just the same way how he had to do it all, and what was of 
                more importance than the rest. </p>
              <p> He knew he must hire laborers as cheaply as possible; but to 
                hire men under bond, paying them in advance at less than the current 
                rate of wages, was what he must not do, even though it was very 
                profitable. Selling straw to the peasants in times of scarcity 
                of provender was what he might do, even though he felt sorry for 
                them; but the tavern and the pothouse must be put down, though 
                they were a source of income. Felling timber must be punished 
                as severely as possible, but he could not exact forfeits for cattle 
                being driven into his fields; and though it annoyed the keeper 
                and made the peasants not afraid to graze their cattle on his 
                land, he could not keep their cattle as a punishment. </p>
              <p> To Piotr, who was paying a moneylender ten per cent a month, 
                he must lend a sum of money to set him free; but he could not 
                let off peasants who did not pay their rent, nor let them fall 
                into arrears. It was impossible to overlook the bailiff's not 
                having mown the meadows and letting the hay spoil; and it was 
                equally impossible to mow eighty dessiatinas where a young copse 
                had been planted. It was impossible to excuse a laborer who had 
                gone home in the busy season because his father was dying, however 
                sorry he might feel for him, and he must subtract from his pay 
                those costly months of idleness, but it was impossible not to 
                allow monthly rations to the old servants who were of absolutely 
                no use. </p>
              <p> Levin knew also that when he got home he must first of all go 
                to his wife, who was unwell, and that the peasants who had been 
                waiting for three hours to see him could wait a little longer. 
                He knew too that, regardless of all the pleasure he felt in taking 
                a swarm, he must forego that pleasure, and leave the old man to 
                see to the bees alone, while he talked to the peasants who had 
                come after him to the beehouse. </p>
              <p> Whether he were acting rightly or wrongly he did not know, and 
                far from trying to prove which it was nowadays he avoided all 
                thought or talk about it. </p>
              <p> Reasoning had brought him to doubt, and prevented him from seeing 
                what he ought to do and what he ought not. When he did not think, 
                but simply lived, he was continually aware of the presence of 
                an infallible judge in his soul, determining which of two possible 
                courses of action was the better and which was the worse; and 
                as soon as he did not act rightly, he was at once aware of it. 
              </p>
              <p> So he lived, not knowing and not seeing any chance of knowing 
                what he was and what he was living for, and harassed at this lack 
                of knowledge to such a point that he was afraid of suicide, and 
                yet firmly laying down his own individual definite path in life.

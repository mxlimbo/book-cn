                `Oblonsky's carriage!' the porter shouted in an angry bass. The 
                carriage drove up and both got in. It was only for the first few 
                moments, while the carriage was driving out of the clubhouse gates, 
                that Levin was still under the influence of the club atmosphere 
                of repose, comfort, and unimpeachable good form. But as soon as 
                the carriage drove out into the street, and he felt it jolting 
                over the uneven road, heard the angry shout of a driver coming 
                toward them, saw in the uncertain light the red blind of a tavern 
                and the shops, this impression was dissipated, and he began to 
                think over his actions, and to wonder whether he was doing right 
                in going to see Anna. What would Kitty say? But Stepan Arkadyevich 
                gave him no time for reflection, and, as though divining his doubts, 
                he dispersed them. </p>
              <p>`How glad I am,' he said, `that you should know her! You know 
                Dolly has long wished for it. And Lvov's been to see her, and 
                often goes. Though she is my sister,' Stepan Arkadyevich pursued, 
                `I don't hesitate to say that she's a remarkable woman.... But 
                you will see. Her position is very painful, especially now.' </p>
              <p> `Why especially now?' </p>
              <p> `We are carrying on negotiations with her husband about a divorce. 
                And he's agreed; but there are difficulties in regard to the son, 
                and the business, which ought to have been arranged long ago, 
                has been dragging on for three months past. As soon as the divorce 
                is over, she will marry Vronsky. How stupid these old ritual forms 
                are - ``Isaiah, rejoice!' - which no one believes in, and which 
                only prevent people being comfortable!' Stepan Arkadyevich put 
                in. `Well, then their position will be as regular as mine, as 
                yours.' </p>
              <p> `What is the difficulty?' said Levin. </p>
              <p> `Oh, it's a long and tedious story The whole business is in 
                such an indefinite state with us. But the point is, she has been 
                for three months in Moscow, where everyone knows her, waiting 
                for the divorce; she goes out nowhere, sees no woman except Dolly, 
                because, do you understand, she doesn't care to have people come 
                as a favor. That fool Princess Varvara, even she has left her, 
                considering this a breach of propriety. Well, you see, in such 
                a position any other woman would not have found resources in herself. 
                But you'll see how she has arranged her life - how calm, how dignified 
                she is. To the left, in the alley opposite the church!' shouted 
                Stepan Arkadyevich, leaning out of the window of the carriage. 
                `Phew! How hot it is!' he said, in spite of twelve degrees of 
                frost, flinging open his unbuttoned overcoat still more. </p>
              <p> `But she has a daughter: no doubt she's busy looking after her?' 
                said Levin. </p>
              <p> `I believe you picture every woman simply as a female, une couveuse,' 
                said Stepan Arkadyevich. `If she's occupied, it must be with her 
                children. No, she brings her up capitally, I believe, but one 
                doesn't hear about her. She's busy, in the first place, with what 
                she writes. I see you're smiling ironically, but you're wrong. 
                She's writing a children's book, and doesn't talk about it to 
                anyone, but she read it to me and I gave the manuscript to Vorkuev... 
                you know, the publisher.... And he's an author himself too, I 
                fancy. He understands those things, and he says it's a remarkable 
                piece of work. But are you fancying she's a writing woman? Not 
                a bit of it. She's a woman with a heart, before everything, but 
                you'll see. Now she has a little English girl with her, and a 
                whole family she's looking after.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, something in a philanthropic way?' </p>
              <p> `Why, you will look at everything in the worst light. It's not 
                from philanthropy, it's from the heart. They - that is, Vronsky 
                - had a trainer, an Englishman, first-rate in his own line, but 
                a drunkard. He's completely given up to drink - delirium tremens 
                - and the family were cast on the world. She saw them, helped 
                them, got more and more interested in them, and now the whole 
                family is on her hands. But not by way of patronage, you know, 
                helping with money; she's herself preparing the boys in Russian 
                for the high school, and she's taken the little girl to live with 
                her. But you'll see her for yourself.' </p>
              <p> The carriage drove into the courtyard, and Stepan Arkadyevich 
                rang loudly at the entrance where a sleigh was standing. </p>
              <p> And, without asking the servant who opened the door whether 
                the lady were at home, Stepan Arkadyevich walked into the hall. 
                Levin followed him, more and more doubtful whether he were doing 
                right or wrong. </p>
              <p> Looking at himself in the glass, Levin noticed that he was red 
                in the face, but he felt certain he was not drunk, and he followed 
                Stepan Arkadyevich up the carpeted stairs. At the top Stepan Arkadyevich 
                inquired of the footman, who bowed to him as to an intimate friend, 
                who was with Anna Arkadyevna, and received the answer that it 
                was M. Vorkuev. </p>
              <p> `Where are they?' </p>
              <p> `In the study.' </p>
              <p> Passing through the dining room, a room not very large, with 
                dark paneled walls, Stepan Arkadyevich and Levin walked over the 
                soft carpet to the half-dark study, lighted up by a single lamp 
                with a big dark shade. Another lamp with a reflector was hanging 
                on the wall, lighting up a big full-length portrait of a woman, 
                which Levin could not help looking at. It was the portrait of 
                Anna, painted in Italy by Mikhailov. While Stepan Arkadyevich 
                went behind the treillage, and the man's voice which had been 
                speaking paused, Levin gazed at the portrait, which stood out 
                from the frame in the brilliant light thrown on it, and he could 
                not tear himself away from it. He positively forgot where he was, 
                and not even hearing what was said, he could not take his eyes 
                off the marvelous portrait. It was not a picture, but a living, 
                charming woman, with black curling hair, with bare arms and shoulders, 
                with a pensive smile on the lips, covered with soft down; triumphantly 
                and softly she looked at him with eyes that baffled him. She was 
                not living, only because she was more beautiful than any living 
                woman can be. </p>
              <p> `I am delighted.' He heard suddenly near him a voice, unmistakably 
                addressing him, the voice of the very woman he had been admiring 
                in the portrait. Anna had come from behind the treillage to meet 
                him, and Levin saw in the dim light of the study the very woman 
                of the portrait, in a dark-blue gown of changeable blue, not in 
                the same position nor with the same expression, but with the same 
                perfection of beauty which the artist had caught in the portrait. 
                She was less dazzling in reality, but, on the other hand, there 
                was something fresh and seductive in the living woman which was 
                not in the portrait. </p>

              <p><br>
                Next day at ten o'clock Levin, who had already gone his rounds, 
                knocked at the room where Vassenka had been put for the night. 
              </p>
              <p>`Entrez!' Veslovsky called to him. `Excuse me, I've only just 
                finished my ablutions,' he said, smiling, standing before him 
                in his underclothes only. </p>
              <p> `Don't mind me, please,' Levin sat down in the window. `Have 
                you slept well?' </p>
              <p> `Like the dead. What sort of day is it for shooting?' </p>
              <p> `What will you take, tea or coffee?' </p>
              <p> `Neither. I'll wait till lunch. I'm really ashamed. I suppose 
                the ladies are down? A walk now would be capital. You show me 
                your horses.' </p>
              <p> After walking about the garden, visiting the stable, and even 
                doing some gymnastic exercises together on the parallel bars, 
                Levin returned to the house with his guest, and went with him 
                into the drawing room. </p>
              <p> `We had splendid shooting, and so many delightful experiences!' 
                said Veslovsky, going up to Kitty, who was sitting at the samovar. 
                `What a pity ladies are cut off from these delights!' </p>
              <p> `Well, I suppose he must say something to the lady of the house,' 
                Levin said to himself. Again he fancied something in the smile, 
                in the all-conquering air with which their guest addressed Kitty... 
              </p>
              <p> The Princess, sitting on the other side of the table with Marya 
                Vlassyevna and Stepan Arkadyevich, called Levin to her side, and 
                began to talk to him about moving to Moscow for Kitty's confinement, 
                and getting ready rooms for them. Just as Levin had disliked all 
                the trivial preparations for his wedding, as derogatory to the 
                grandeur of the event, now he felt still more offensive the preparations 
                for the approaching birth, the date of which they reckoned, it 
                seemed, on their fingers. He tried to turn a deaf ear to these 
                discussions of the best patterns of long clothes for the coming 
                baby; tried to turn away and avoid seeing the mysterious, endless 
                strips of knitting, the triangles of linen, to which Dolly attached 
                special importance, and so on. The birth of a son (he was certain 
                it would be a son) which was promised him, but which he still 
                could not believe in - so marvelous it seemed - presented itself 
                to his mind, on one hand, as a happiness so immense, and therefore 
                so incredible; on the other, as an event so mysterious, that this 
                assumption of a definite knowledge of what would be, and consequent 
                preparation for it, as for something ordinary that did happen 
                to people, jarred on him as confusing and humiliating. </p>
              <p> But the Princess did not understand his feelings, and put down 
                his reluctance to think and talk about it to carelessness and 
                indifference, and so she gave him no peace. She had commissioned 
                Stepan Arkadyevich to look at an apartment, and now she called 
                Levin to her. </p>
              <p> `I know nothing about it, Princess. Do as you think fit,' he 
                said. </p>
              <p> `You must decide when you will move.' </p>
              <p> `I really don't know. I know millions of children are born away 
                from Moscow, and doctors... Why...' </p>
              <p> `But if so...' </p>
              <p> `Oh, no, as Kitty wishes.' </p>
              <p> `We can't talk to Kitty about it! Do you want me to frighten 
                her? Why, this spring Natalie Golitzina died from having an ignorant 
                doctor.' </p>
              <p> `I will do just what you say,' he said gloomily. </p>
              <p> The Princess began talking to him, but he did not hear her. 
                Though the conversation with the Princess had indeed jarred upon 
                him, he was gloomy not on account of that conversation, but from 
                what he saw at the samovar. </p>
              <p> `No, it's impossible,' he thought, glancing now and then at 
                Vassenka bending over Kitty, telling her something with his charming 
                smile, and at her, flushed and disturbed. </p>
              <p> There was something unclean in Vassenka's attitude, in his eyes, 
                in his smile. Levin even saw something unclean in Kitty's attitude 
                and look. And again the light died away in his eyes. Again, as 
                before, all of a sudden, without the slightest transition, he 
                felt cast down from a pinnacle of happiness, peace, and dignity, 
                into an abyss of despair, rage, and humiliation. Again everything 
                and everyone had become hateful to him. </p>
              <p> `You do just as you think best, Princess,' he said again, looking 
                round. </p>
              <p> `Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown!' Stepan Arkadyevich 
                said playfully, hinting, evidently, not simply at the Princess's 
                conversation, but at the cause of Levin's agitation, which he 
                had noticed. `How late you are today, Dolly!' </p>
              <p> Everyone got up to greet Darya Alexandrovna. Vassenka only rose 
                for an instant, and, with the lack of courtesy to ladies characteristic 
                of the modern young man, he scarcely bowed, and resumed his conversation 
                again, laughing at something. </p>
              <p> `Masha has been almost the end of me. She did not sleep well, 
                and is dreadfully capricious today,' said Dolly. </p>
              <p> The conversation Vassenka had started with Kitty was running 
                on the same lines as on the previous evening - discussing Anna, 
                and whether love is to be put higher than worldly considerations. 
                Kitty disliked the conversation, and she was disturbed both by 
                the subject and the tone in which it was conducted, and especially 
                by the knowledge of the effect it would have on her husband. But 
                she was too simple and unsophisticated to know how to cut short 
                this conversation, or even to conceal the superficial pleasure 
                afforded her by the young man's very obvious admiration. She wanted 
                to stop this conversation, but she did not know what to do. Whatever 
                she did, she knew it would be observed by her husband, and the 
                worst interpretation put on it. And, in fact, when she asked Dolly 
                what was wrong with Masha, and Vassenka, waiting till this uninteresting 
                conversation was over, began to gaze indifferently at Dolly, the 
                question struck Levin as an unnatural and disgusting piece of 
                hypocrisy. </p>
              <p> `What do you say, shall we go and look for mushrooms today?' 
                said Dolly. </p>
              <p> `By all means, please, and I shall come too,' said Kitty, and 
                she blushed. She wanted from politeness to ask Vassenka whether 
                he would come, and she did not ask him. `Where are you going, 
                Kostia?' she asked her husband with a guilty face, as he passed 
                by her with a resolute step. This guilty air confirmed all his 
                suspicions. </p>
              <p> `The mechanician came when I was away; I haven't seen him yet,' 
                he said, not looking at her. </p>
              <p> He went downstairs, but before he had time to leave his study 
                he heard his wife's familiar footsteps running with reckless speed 
                to him. </p>
              <p> `What do you want?' he said to her shortly. `We are busy.' </p>
              <p> `I beg your pardon,' she said to the German mechanician; `I 
                want a few words with my husband.' </p>
              <p> The German would have left the room, but Levin said to him: 
              </p>
              <p> `Don't disturb yourself' </p>
              <p> `The train is at three?' queried the German. `I mustn't be late.' 
              </p>
              <p> Levin did not answer him, but walked out himself with his wife. 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, what have you to say to me?' he said to her in French. 
              </p>
              <p> He did not look her in the face, and did not care to see that 
                she in her condition was trembling all over, and had a piteous, 
                crushed look. </p>
              <p> `I... I want to say that we can't go on like this; that this 
                is misery...' she said. </p>
              <p> `The servants are here at the buttery,' he said angrily; `don't 
                make a scene.' </p>
              <p> `Well, let's go in here!' </p>
              <p> They were standing in the passage room. Kitty would have gone 
                into the next room, but there the English governess was giving 
                Tania a lesson. </p>
              <p> `Well, come into the garden.' </p>
              <p> In the garden they came upon a peasant weeding the path. And 
                no longer considering that the peasant could see her tear-stained 
                and his agitated face, that they looked like people fleeing from 
                some disaster, they went on with rapid steps, feeling that they 
                must speak out and clear up misunderstandings, must be alone together, 
                and so get rid of the misery they were both feeling. </p>
              <p> `We can't go on like this! It's misery! I am wretched; you are 
                wretched. What for?' she said, when they had at last reached a 
                solitary garden seat at a turn in the linden tree avenue. </p>
              <p> `But tell me one thing: was there in his tone anything unseemly, 
                unclean, humiliatingly horrible?' he said, standing before her 
                again in the same position, with his clenched fists on his chest, 
                as he had stood before her that night. </p>
              <p> `Yes,' she said in a shaking voice; `but, Kostia, surely you 
                see I'm not to blame? All the morning I've been trying to take 
                a tone... But such people... Why did he come? How happy we were!' 
                she said, breathless with the sobs that shook her. </p>
              <p> Although nothing had been pursuing them, and there was nothing 
                to run away from, and they could not possibly have found anything 
                very delightful on that garden seat, the gardener saw with astonishment 
                that they passed him on their way home with comforted and radiant 
                faces. </p>

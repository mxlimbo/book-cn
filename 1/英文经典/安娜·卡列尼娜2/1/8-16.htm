                Sergei Ivanovich, being practiced in dialectics, did not reply, 
                but at once turned the conversation to another aspect of the subject. 
              </p>
              <p>`Oh, if you want to learn the spirit of the people by arithmetical 
                computation, of course it's very difficult to arrive at it. And 
                voting has not been introduced among us, and cannot be introduced, 
                for it does not express the will of the people; but there are 
                other ways of reaching that. It is felt in the air, it is felt 
                by the heart. I won't speak of those deep currents which are astir 
                in the still ocean of the people, and which are evident to every 
                unprejudiced man - let us look at society in the narrow sense. 
                All the most diverse sections of the intelligent people, hostile 
                before, are merged in one. Every division is at an end, all the 
                public organs say the same thing over and over again, all feel 
                the mighty torrent that has overtaken them and is carrying them 
                in one direction.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, all the newspapers do say the same thing,' said the Prince. 
                `That's true. But so it is the same thing that all the frogs croak 
                before storm. One can hear nothing for them.' </p>
              <p> `Frogs or no frogs, I'm not the publisher of newspapers and 
                I don't want to defend them; but I am speaking of the unanimity 
                in the intellectual world,' said Sergei Ivanovich, addressing 
                his brother. Levin would have answered, but the old Prince interrupted 
                him. </p>
              <p> `Well, about that unanimity, that's another thing, one may say,' 
                said the Prince. `There's my son-in-law, Stepan Arkadyevich - 
                you know him. He's got a place now on the committee of a commission 
                and something or other, I don't remember. Only there's nothing 
                to do in it - why, Dolly, it's no secret - and a salary of eight 
                thousand! You try asking him whether his post is of any use - 
                he'll prove to you that it's most necessary. And he's a truthful 
                man, too, but one can't help but believe in the utility of eight 
                thousand roubles.' </p>
              <p> `Yes - he asked me to give a message to Darya Alexandrovna about 
                the post,' said Sergei Ivanovich reluctantly, feeling the Prince's 
                remark to be ill-timed. </p>
              <p> `So it is with the unanimity of the press. That's been explained 
                to me: as soon as there's war their incomes are doubled. How can 
                they help believing in the destinies of the people and the Slavonic 
                races - and all that sort of thing?...' </p>
              <p> `I don't care for many of the papers, but that's unjust,' said 
                Sergei Ivanovich. </p>
              <p> `I would only make one condition,' pursued the old Prince. `Alphonse 
                Karr said a capital thing before the war with Prussia: ``You consider 
                war to be inevitable? Very good. Let everyone who advocates war 
                be enrolled in a special regiment of advance guards, for the vanguard 
                of every assault, of every attack, to lead them all!'' </p>
              <p> `A nice lot the editors would make!' said Katavassov, with a 
                loud roar, as he pictured the editors he knew in this picked legion. 
              </p>
              <p> `But they'd run,' said Dolly. `They'd only be in the way.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, if they ran away, then we'd have grapeshot or Cossacks 
                with whips behind them,' said the Prince. </p>
              <p> `But that's a joke, and a poor one too, if you'll excuse me 
                saying so, Prince,' said Sergei Ivanovich. </p>
              <p> `I don't see that it was a joke, that... Levin was beginning, 
                but Sergei Ivanovich interrupted him. </p>
              <p> `Every member of society is called upon to do his own special 
                work,' said he. `And men of thought are doing their work when 
                they express public opinion. And the singlehearted and full expression 
                of public opinion is the service of the press, and a phenomenon 
                to rejoice us at the same time. Twenty years ago we should have 
                been silent, but now we have heard the voice of the Russian people, 
                which is ready to rise as one man and ready to sacrifice itself 
                for its oppressed brethren; that is a great step and a proof of 
                strength.' </p>
              <p> `But it's not only making a sacrifice, but killing Turks,' said 
                Levin timidly. `The people make sacrifices and are ready to make 
                sacrifices for their soul, but not for murder,' he added, instinctively 
                connecting the conversation with the ideas that had been absorbing 
                his mind. </p>
              <p> `For their soul? That, you understand, is a most puzzling expression 
                for a student of the natural sciences. What sort of thing is the 
                soul?' said Katavassov, smiling. </p>
              <p> `Oh, you know!' </p>
              <p> `No, by God, I haven't the faintest idea!' said Katavassov with 
                a loud roar of laughter. </p>
              <p> `'I bring not peace, but a sword,' says Christ,' Sergei Ivanovich 
                rejoined for his part, quoting as simply as though it were the 
                easiest thing to understand the very passage that had always puzzled 
                Levin most. </p>
              <p> `That's so, no doubt,' the old man repeated again. He was standing 
                near them and responded to a chance glance turned in his direction. 
              </p>
              <p> `Ah, my dear fellow, you're defeated, utterly defeated!' cried 
                Katavassov good-humoredly. </p>
              <p> Levin reddened with vexation, not at being defeated, but at 
                having failed to control himself and being drawn into argument. 
              </p>
              <p> `No, I can't argue with them,' he thought; `they wear impenetrable 
                armor, while I'm naked.' </p>
              <p> He saw that it was impossible to convince his brother and Katavassov, 
                and he saw even less possibility of himself agreeing with them. 
                What they advocated was the very pride of intellect that had almost 
                been his ruin. He could not admit that some dozens of men, among 
                them his brother, had the right, on the ground of what they were 
                told by some hundreds of glib volunteers swarming to the capital, 
                to say that they and the newspapers were expressing the will and 
                feeling of the people, and a feeling which was expressed in vengeance 
                and murder. He could not admit this, because he neither saw the 
                expression of such feelings in the people among whom he was living, 
                nor found them in himself (and he could not but consider himself 
                one of the persons making up the Russian people), and most of 
                all because he, like the people, did not know and could not know 
                what is for the general good, though he knew beyond a doubt that 
                this general good could be attained only by the strict observance 
                of that law of right and wrong which has been revealed to every 
                man, and therefore he could not wish for war or advocate war for 
                any general objects whatever. He said as Mikhailich did and the 
                people, who had expressed their feeling in the traditional invitations 
                to the Variaghi: `Be princes and rule over us. Gladly we promise 
                complete submission. All the labor, all humiliations, all sacrifices 
                we take upon ourselves; but we will not judge and decide.' And 
                now, according to Sergei Ivanovich's account, the people had foregone 
                this privilege they had bought at such a costly price. </p>
              <p> He wanted to say, too, that if public opinion were an infallible 
                guide, then why were not revolutions and the commune as lawful 
                as the movement in favor of the Slavonic peoples? But these were 
                merely thoughts that could settle nothing. One thing could be 
                seen beyond doubt - that at the actual moment the discussion was 
                irritating Sergei Ivanovich, and so it was wrong to continue it. 
                And Levin ceased speaking and then called the attention of his 
                guests to the fact that the storm clouds were gathering, and that 
                they had better be going home before it rained. </p>

                When Vronsky returned home, Anna was not yet home. Soon after 
                he had left, some lady, so they told him, had come to see her, 
                and she had gone out with her. That she had gone out without leaving 
                word where she was going, that she had not yet come back, and 
                that all the morning she had been going about somewhere without 
                a word to him - all this, together with the strange look of excitement 
                in her face in the morning, and the recollection of the hostile 
                tone with which she had before Iashvin almost snatched her son's 
                photographs out of his hands, made him serious. He decided he 
                absolutely must speak openly with her. And he waited for her in 
                her drawing room. But Anna did not return alone, but brought with 
                her her old unmarried aunt, Princess Oblonskaia. This was the 
                lady who had come in the morning, and with whom Anna had gone 
                out shopping. Anna appeared not to notice Vronsky's worried and 
                inquiring expression, and began a lively account of her morning's 
                shopping. He saw that there was something working within her; 
                in her flashing eyes, when they rested for a moment on him, there 
                was an intense concentration, and in her words and movements there 
                was that nervous rapidity and grace which, during the early period 
                of their intimacy, had so fascinated him, but which now so disturbed 
                and alarmed him. </p>
              <p>The dinner was laid for four. All were gathered together and 
                about to go into the little dining room when Tushkevich made his 
                appearance with a message from Princess Betsy. Princess Betsy 
                begged her to excuse her not having come to say good-by; she had 
                been indisposed, but begged Anna to come to her between half-past 
                six and half-past eight o'clock. Vronsky glanced at Anna at the 
                precise limit of time, so suggestive of steps having been taken 
                that she should meet no one; but Anna appeared not to notice it. 
              </p>
              <p> `Very sorry that I can't come just between half-past six and 
                nine,' she said with a faint smile. </p>
              <p> `The Princess will be very sorry.' </p>
              <p> `And so shall I.' </p>
              <p> `You're going, no doubt, to hear Patti?' said Tushkevich. </p>
              <p> `Patti? You give me an idea. I would go if it were possible 
                to get a box.' </p>
              <p> `I can get one,' Tushkevich offered his services. </p>
              <p> `I should be very, very grateful to you,' said Anna. `But won't 
                you dine with us?' </p>
              <p> Vronsky gave a hardly perceptible shrug. He was at a complete 
                loss to understand what Anna was about. What had she brought the 
                old Princess Oblonskaia home for, what had she made Tushkevich 
                stay to dinner for, and, most amazing of all, why was she sending 
                him for a box? Could she possibly think in her position of going 
                to Patti's benefit, where all the circle of her acquaintances 
                would be? He looked at her with serious eyes, but she responded 
                with that defiant, half-mirthful, half-desperate look, the meaning 
                of which he could not comprehend. At dinner Anna was in aggressively 
                high spirits - she almost flirted both with Tushkevich and with 
                Iashvin. When they got up from dinner and Tushkevich had gone 
                to get a box at the opera, Iashvin went to smoke, and Vronsky 
                went down with him to his own rooms. After sitting there for some 
                time he ran upstairs. Anna was already dressed in a low-necked 
                gown of light silk and velvet that she had had made in Paris, 
                and with costly white lace on her head, framing her face, and 
                particularly becoming, showing up her dazzling beauty. </p>
              <p> `Are you really going to the theater?' he said, trying not to 
                look at her. </p>
              <p> `Why do you ask with such alarm?' she said, wounded again at 
                his not looking at her. `Why shouldn't I go?' </p>
              <p> She appeared not to understand the meaning of his words. </p>
              <p> `Oh, of course there's no reason whatever,' he said frowning. 
              </p>
              <p> `That's just what I say,' she said, willfully refusing to see 
                the irony of his tone, and quietly turning back her long, perfumed 
                glove. </p>
              <p> `Anna, for God's sake! What is the matter with you?' he said, 
                watching her exactly as once her husband had done. </p>
              <p> `I don't understand what you are asking.' </p>
              <p> `You know that it's out of the question to go.' </p>
              <p> `Why so? I'm not going alone. Princess Varvara has gone to dress 
                - she is going with me.' </p>
              <p> He shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity and despair. 
              </p>
              <p> `But do you mean to say you don't know?...' he began. </p>
              <p> `But I don't care to know!' she almost shrieked. `I don't care 
                to. Do I regret what I have done? No, no, no! If it were all to 
                do again from the beginning, it would be the same. For us, for 
                you and for me, there is only one thing that matters, whether 
                we love each other. Other people we need not consider. Why are 
                we living here apart and not seeing each other? Why can't I go? 
                I love you, and I don't care for anything,' she said in Russian, 
                glancing at him with a peculiar, obscure for him, gleam in her 
                eyes, `if you have not changed to me.... Why don't you look at 
                me?' </p>
              <p> He looked at her. He saw all the beauty of her face and full 
                dress, always so becoming to her. But now her beauty and elegance 
                were just what irritated him. </p>
              <p> `My feeling cannot change, you know, but I beg you, I entreat 
                you,' he said again in French, with a note of tender supplication 
                in his voice, but with coldness in his eyes. </p>
              <p> She did not hear his words, but she saw the coldness of his 
                eyes, and answered with irritation: </p>
              <p> `And I beg you to explain why I should not go.' </p>
              <p> `Because it might cause you...' He hesitated. </p>
              <p> `I don't understand. Iashvin n'est compromettant, and Princess 
                Varvara is no worse than others. Oh, here she is!' </p>

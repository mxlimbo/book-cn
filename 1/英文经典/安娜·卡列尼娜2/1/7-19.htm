                Stepan Arkadyevich was about to go away when Kornei came in to 
                announce: <br>
                `Sergei Alexeevich!' </p>
              <p> `Who's Sergei Alexeevich?' Stepan Arkadyevich was about to ask, 
                but he remembered immediately. </p>
              <p> `Ah, Seriozha!' he said aloud. - `'sergei Alexeevich!' I thought 
                it was the director of some department. - Anna asked me to see 
                him too,' he remembered. </p>
              <p> And he recalled the timid, piteous expression with which Anna 
                had said to him at parting: `Anyway, you will see him. Find out 
                exactly where he is, who is looking after him. And Stiva... If 
                it were possible! Could it be possible?' Stepan Arkadyevich knew 
                what was meant by that `if it were possible,' - if it were possible 
                to arrange the divorce so as to let her have her son.... Stepan 
                Arkadyevich saw now that it was useless to dream of that, but 
                still he was glad to see his nephew. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich reminded his brother-in-law that they never 
                spoke to the boy of his mother, and he begged him not to mention 
                a single word about her. </p>
              <p> `He was very ill after that interview with his mother, which 
                we had not foreseen,' said Alexei Alexandrovich. `Indeed, we feared 
                for his life. But with rational treatment, and sea bathing in 
                the summer, he regained his strength, and now, by the doctor's 
                advice, I have let him go to school. And certainly the companionship 
                at school has had a good effect on him, and he is perfectly well, 
                and making good progress.' </p>
              <p> `What a fine fellow he's grown! And he's no longer Seriozha, 
                but quite full-fledged - Sergei Alexeevich!' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                smiling, as he looked at the handsome, broad-shouldered lad in 
                blue jacket and long trousers, who walked in alertly and confidently. 
                The boy looked healthy and good-humored. He bowed to his uncle 
                as to a stranger, but, recognizing him, he blushed and turned 
                hurriedly away from him, as though offended and irritated at something. 
                The boy went up to his father and handed him a note of the marks 
                he had gained in school. </p>
              <p> `Well, that's very fair,' said his father, `you may go.' </p>
              <p> `He's thinner and taller, and has grown from a child into a 
                boy; I like that,' said Stepan Arkadyevich. `Do you remember me?' 
              </p>
              <p> The boy looked back quickly at his uncle. </p>
              <p> `Yes, mon oncle,' he answered, glancing at his father, and again 
                he looked downcast. </p>
              <p> His uncle called him to him, and took his hand. </p>
              <p> `Well, and how are you getting on?' he said, wanting to talk 
                to him, and not knowing what to say. </p>
              <p> The boy, blushing and making no answer, cautiously drew his 
                hand away. As soon as Stepan Arkadyevich let go his hand, he glanced 
                doubtfully at his father, and, like a bird set free, he darted 
                out of the room. </p>
              <p> A year had passed since the last time Seriozha had seen his 
                mother. Since then he had heard nothing more of her. And in the 
                course of that year he had gone to school, and made friends among 
                his schoolfellows. The dreams and memories of his mother, which 
                had made him ill after seeing her, did not occupy his thoughts 
                now. When they came back to him, he studiously drove them away, 
                regarding them as shameful and girlish, below the dignity of a 
                boy and a schoolboy. He knew that his father and mother were separated 
                by some quarrel, he knew that he had to remain with his father, 
                and he tried to get used to that idea. </p>
              <p> He disliked seeing his uncle, so like his mother, for it called 
                up those memories which he was ashamed of. He disliked it all 
                the more as, from certain words he had caught as he waited at 
                the study door, and still more from the faces of his father and 
                uncle, he had guessed that they must have been talking of his 
                mother. And to avoid condemning the father with whom he lived 
                and on whom he was dependent, and, above all, to avoid giving 
                way to sentimentality, which he considered so degrading, Seriozha 
                tried not to look at his uncle, who had come to disturb his peace 
                of mind, and not to think of what he recalled to him. </p>
              <p> But when Stepan Arkadyevich, going out after him, saw him on 
                the stairs, and, calling to him, asked him how he spent his playtime 
                at school, Seriozha talked more freely to him away from his father's 
                presence. </p>
              <p> `We have a railway now,' he said in answer to his uncle's question. 
                `It's like this, you see: two sit on a bench - they're the passengers; 
                and one stands up straight on the bench. And all are harnessed 
                to it by their arms or by their belts, and they run through all 
                the rooms - the doors are left open beforehand. Well, and it's 
                pretty hard work being the conductor!' </p>
              <p> `That's the one that stands?' Stepan Arkadyevich inquired, smiling. 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, you want pluck for it, and cleverness too, especially 
                when they stop all of a sudden, or someone falls down.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, that must be a serious matter,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                watching with mournful interest the eager eyes, like his mother's; 
                not childish now - no longer fully innocent. And though he had 
                promised Alexei Alexandrovich not to speak of Anna, he could not 
                restrain himself. </p>
              <p> `Do you remember your mother?' he asked suddenly. </p>
              <p> `No, I don't,' Seriozha said quickly. He blushed crimson, his 
                eyes drooping. And his uncle could get nothing more out of him. 
              </p>
              <p> His Slavic tutor found his pupil on the staircase half an hour 
                later, and for a long while he could not make out whether he was 
                ill-tempered or crying. </p>
              <p> `What is it? I expect you hurt yourself when you fell down?' 
                said the tutor. `I told you it was a dangerous game. And we shall 
                have to speak to the director.' </p>
              <p> `If I had hurt myself, nobody should have found it out, that's 
                certain.' </p>
              <p> `Well, what is it, then?' </p>
              <p> `Leave me alone! If I remember, or if I don't remember?... What 
                business is it of his? Why should I remember? Leave me in peace!' 
                he said, addressing not his tutor, but the whole world. </p>

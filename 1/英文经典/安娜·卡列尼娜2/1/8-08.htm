              <p><br>
                Ever since, by his beloved brother's deathbed, Levin had first 
                glanced into the questions of life and death in the light of these 
                new convictions, as he called them, which had during the period 
                from his twentieth to his thirty-fourth year imperceptibly replaced 
                his childish and youthful beliefs - he had been stricken with 
                horror, not so much of death, as of life, without any knowledge 
                of whence, and why, and how, and what it was. The physical organization, 
                its decay, the Indestructibility of matter, the law of the conservation 
                of energy, evolution, were the words which usurped the place of 
                his old belief. These words and the ideas associated with them 
                were very well for intellectual purposes. But for life they yielded 
                nothing, and Levin felt suddenly like a man who has changed his 
                warm fur cloak for a muslin garment, and going for the first time 
                into the frost is immediately convinced, not by reason, but by 
                his whole nature, that he is as good as naked, and that he must 
                infallibly perish miserably. </p>
              <p>From that moment, though he did not distinctly face it, and still 
                went on living as before, Levin had never lost this sense of terror 
                at his lack of knowledge. </p>
              <p> He vaguely felt, too, that what he called his new convictions 
                were not merely lack of knowledge, but that they were part of 
                a whole order of ideas, in which no knowledge of what he needed 
                was possible. </p>
              <p> At first, marriage, with the new joys and duties bound up with 
                it, had completely crowded out these thoughts. But of late, while 
                he was staying in Moscow after his wife's confinement, with nothing 
                to do, the question that clamored for solution had more and more 
                often, more and more insistently, haunted Levin's mind. </p>
              <p> The question was summed up for him thus: `If I do not accept 
                the answers Christianity gives to the problems of my life, what 
                answers do I accept?' And in the whole arsenal of his convictions, 
                so far from finding any satisfactory answers, he was utterly unable 
                to find anything at all like an answer. </p>
              <p> He was in the position of a man seeking food in toyshops and 
                firearm shops. </p>
              <p> Instinctively, unconsciously, with every book, with every conversation, 
                with every man he met, he was on the lookout for light on these 
                questions and their solution. </p>
              <p> What puzzled and distracted him above everything was that the 
                majority of men of his age and circle had, like him, exchanged 
                their old beliefs for the same new convictions, and yet saw nothing 
                to lament in this, and were perfectly satisfied and serene. So 
                that, apart from the principal question, Levin was tortured by 
                other questions too: were these people sincere? or were they playing 
                a part? or was it that they understood the answers science gave 
                to these problems in some different, clearer sense than he did? 
                And he assiduously studied both these men's opinions and the books 
                which treated of these scientific explanations. </p>
              <p> One fact he had found out since these questions had engrossed 
                his mind - that he had been quite wrong in supposing, from the 
                recollections of the university circle of his young days, that 
                religion had outlived its day, and that it was now practically 
                nonexistent. All the people nearest to him who were good in their 
                lives were believers. The old Prince, and Lvov, whom he liked 
                so much, and Sergei Ivanovich; and all the women believed; and 
                his wife believed as simply as he had believed in his earliest 
                childhood; and ninety-nine hundredths of the Russian people, all 
                the people for whose life he felt the deepest respect, believed. 
              </p>
              <p> Another fact of which he became convinced, after reading many 
                books, was that the men who shared his views had no other construction 
                to put on them, and that they gave no explanation of the questions 
                which he felt he could not live without answering, but simply 
                ignored their existence and attempted to explain other questions 
                of no possible interest to him, such as the evolution of organisms, 
                the mechanistic theory of the soul, etc. </p>
              <p> Moreover, during his wife's confinement, something had happened 
                that seemed extraordinary to him. He, an unbeliever, had fallen 
                into praying, and at the moment he prayed, he believed. But that 
                moment had passed, and he could not make his state of mind at 
                that moment fit into the rest of his life. </p>
              <p> He could not admit that at that moment he knew the truth, and 
                that now he was wrong; for as soon as he began thinking calmly 
                about it, it all fell to pieces. He could not admit that he was 
                mistaken then, for his spiritual condition then was precious to 
                him, and to admit that it was a proof of weakness would have been 
                to desecrate those moments. He was miserably divided against himself, 
                and strained all his spiritual forces to the utmost to escape 
                from this condition. </p>

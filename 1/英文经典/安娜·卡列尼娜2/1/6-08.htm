              <p><br>
                Next day, before the ladies were up, the carriages for the shooting 
                party, the droshky and a trap, were at the door, and Laska, aware 
                since early morning that they were going shooting, after much 
                whining and darting to and fro, had sat herself down in the droshky 
                beside the coachman, and, disapproving of the delay, was excitedly 
                watching the door from which the sportsmen still did not issue. 
                The first to come out was Vassenka Veslovsky, in new high boots 
                that reached halfway up his thick thighs, in a green blouse, with 
                a new cartridge belt, redolent of leather, and in his Scotch cap 
                with ribbons, with a brand-new English gun without a sling. Laska 
                flew up to him, welcomed him, and, jumping up, asked him in her 
                own way whether the others were coming soon; but getting no answer 
                from him, she returned to her post of observation and sank into 
                repose again, her head on one side, and one ear pricked up to 
                listen. At last the door opened with a creak, and Stepan Arkadyevich's 
                spot-and-tan pointer Krak flew out, running round and round and 
                turning over in the air. Stepan Arkadyevich himself followed with 
                a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth. `Soho, soho, Krak!' 
                he cried encouragingly to the dog, who put his paws up on his 
                chest, catching at his gamebag. Stepan Arkadyevich was dressed 
                in brogues and puttees, in torn trousers and a short coat. On 
                his head there was a wreck of a hat of indefinite form, but his 
                gun of a new patent was a perfect gem, and his gamebag and cartridge 
                belt, though worn, were of the very best quality. </p>
              <p>Vassenka Veslovsky had had no notion before that it was truly 
                chic for a sportsman to be in tatters, but to have his shooting 
                outfit of the best quality. He saw it now as he looked at Stepan 
                Arkadyevich, radiant in his rags, graceful, well-fed, and joyous, 
                a typical Russian nobleman. And he made up his mind that next 
                time he went shooting he would certainly adopt the same getup. 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, and what about our host?' he asked. </p>
              <p> `A young wife,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, smiling. </p>
              <p> `Yes, and such a charming one!' </p>
              <p> `He came down dressed. No doubt he's run up to her again.' </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich guessed right. Levin had run up again to 
                his wife to ask her once more if she forgave him for his idiocy 
                yesterday, and, moreover, to beg her in Christ's name to be more 
                careful. The great thing was for her to keep away from the children 
                - they might any minute jostle against her. Then he had once more 
                to hear her declare that she was not angry with him for going 
                away for two days, and to beg her to be sure to send a note next 
                morning by a servant on horseback, to write him, if it were but 
                two words only, to let him know that all was well with her. </p>
              <p> Kitty was distressed, as she always was, at parting for a couple 
                of days from her husband, but when she saw his eager figure, looking 
                big and strong in his shooting boots and his white blouse, and 
                a sort of sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to 
                her, she forgot her own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure, 
                and said good-by to him cheerfully. </p>
              <p> `Pardon, gentlemen!' he said, running out on the steps. `Have 
                you put the lunch in? Why is the chestnut on the right? Well, 
                it doesn't matter. Laska, down; go and lie down!' </p>
              <p> `Put them with the herd of heifers,' he said to the herdsman 
                who was waiting for him at the steps to ask him what was to be 
                done with the geld oxen. `Excuse me, here comes another villain.' 
              </p>
              <p> Levin jumped out of the droshky, in which he had already taken 
                his seat, to meet the carpenter, who came toward the steps with 
                a rule in his hand. </p>
              <p> `You didn't come to the countinghouse yesterday, and now you're 
                detaining me. Well, what is it?' </p>
              <p> `Would your honor let me make another turning? There's only 
                three steps to add. And we make it just fit at the same time. 
                It will be much more convenient.' </p>
              <p> `You should have listened to me,' Levin answered with annoyance. 
                `I said: Put the lines and then fit in the steps. Now there's 
                no setting it right. Do as I told you, and make a new staircase.' 
              </p>
              <p> The point was that in the wing that was being built the carpenter 
                had spoiled the staircase, fitting it together without calculating 
                the space it was to fill, so that the steps were all sloping when 
                it was put in place. Now the carpenter wanted to keep the same 
                staircase, by adding three steps. </p>
              <p> `It will be much better.' </p>
              <p> `But where's your staircase coming out with its three steps?' 
              </p>
              <p> `Why, upon my word, sir,' the carpenter said with a contemptuous 
                smile. `It comes out right at the very spot. It starts here,' 
                he said, with a persuasive gesture, `then it'll go up, and go 
                up and come out.' </p>
              <p> `But three steps will add to the length too... where is it to 
                come out?' </p>
              <p> `Why, to be sure, it'll go up, and come out,' the carpenter 
                said obstinately and convincingly. </p>
              <p> `It'll reach the ceiling and the wall.' </p>
              <p> `Upon my word! Why, it'll go up, and go up, and come out like 
                this.' </p>
              <p> Levin took out a ramrod and began sketching him the staircase 
                in the dust. </p>
              <p> `There, do you see?' </p>
              <p> `As your honor likes,' said the carpenter, with a sudden gleam 
                in his eyes, obviously understanding the thing at last. `It seems 
                it'll be best to make a new one.' </p>
              <p> `Well, then, do it as you're told,' Levin shouted, seating himself 
                in the droshky. `Down! Hold the dogs, Philip!' </p>
              <p> Levin felt now at leaving behind all his family and household 
                cares such an eager sense of joy in life and expectation that 
                he was not disposed to talk. Besides that, he had that feeling 
                of concentrated excitement that every sportsman experiences as 
                he approaches the scene of action. If he had anything on his mind 
                at that moment, it was only the doubt whether they would start 
                anything in the Kolpensky marsh, whether Laska would show to advantage 
                in comparison with Krak, and whether he would shoot well that 
                day himself. Not to disgrace himself before a new spectator - 
                not to be outdone by Oblonsky - that too was a thought that crossed 
                his brain. </p>
              <p> Oblonsky was feeling the same, and he too was not talkative. 
                Vassenka Veslovsky alone kept up a ceaseless flow of cheerful 
                chatter. As he listened to him now, Levin felt ashamed to think 
                how unfair he had been to him the day before. Vassenka was really 
                a fine fellow, simple, goodhearted, and very good-humored. If 
                Levin had met him before he was married, he would have made friends 
                with him. Levin rather disliked his holiday attitude to life and 
                a sort of free and easy assumption of elegance. It was as though 
                he assumed a high degree of importance in himself that could not 
                be disputed, because he had long nails and a stylish cap, and 
                everything else to correspond; but this could be forgiven for 
                the sake of his good nature and good breeding. Levin liked him 
                for his good education, for speaking French and English with such 
                an excellent accent, and for being a man of his world. </p>
              <p> Vassenka was extremely delighted with the left outrigger, a 
                horse of the Don steppes. He kept praising him enthusiastically. 
                `How fine it must be galloping over the steppes on a steppe horse! 
                Eh? Isn't it?' he said. He had imagined riding on a steppe horse 
                as something wild and romantic, and it turned out nothing of the 
                sort. But his simplicity, particularly in conjunction with his 
                good looks, his amiable smile, and the grace of his movements, 
                was very attractive. Either because his nature was sympathetic 
                to Levin, or because Levin was trying to atone for his sins of 
                the previous evening by seeing nothing but what was good in him 
                - at any rate, he liked his society. </p>
              <p> After they had driven three verstas from home, Veslovsky all 
                at once felt for a cigar and his pocketbook, and did not know 
                whether he had lost them or left them on the table. In the pocketbook 
                there were three hundred and seventy roubles, and so the matter 
                could not be left in uncertainty. </p>
              <p> `Do you know what, Levin, I'll gallop home on that outrigger. 
                That will be splendid. Eh?' he said, preparing to get out. </p>
              <p> `No, why should you?' answered Levin, calculating that Vassenka 
                could hardly weigh less than six poods. `I'll send the coachman.' 
              </p>
              <p> The coachman rode back on the outrigger, and Levin himself drove 
                the remaining pair. </p>

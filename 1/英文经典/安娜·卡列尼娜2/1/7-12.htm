                After taking leave of her guests, Anna did not sit down, but began 
                walking up and down the room. She had unconsciously the whole 
                evening done her utmost to arouse in Levin a feeling of love - 
                as of late she had fallen into doing with all young men - and 
                she knew she had attained her aim, as far as was possible in one 
                evening, with a married and conscientious man. She liked him very 
                much indeed, and, in spite of the striking difference, from the 
                masculine point of view, between Vronsky and Levin, as a woman 
                she saw something they had in common, which had made Kitty able 
                to love both. Yet as soon as he was out of the room, she ceased 
                to think of him. </p>
              <p>One thought, and one only, pursued her in different forms, and 
                refused to be shaken off. `If I have so much effect on others, 
                on this man, who loves his home and his wife, why is it he is 
                so cold to me?... Not cold exactly - he loves me, I know that! 
                But something new is drawing us apart now. Why wasn't he here 
                all the evening? He told Stiva to say he could not leave Iashvin, 
                and must watch over his play. Is Iashvin a child? But supposing 
                it's true. He never tells a he. But there's something else in 
                it if it's true. He is glad of an opportunity of showing me that 
                he has other duties; I know that, I submit to that. But why prove 
                that to me? He wants to show me that his love for me is not to 
                interfere with his freedom. But I need no proofs - I need love. 
                He ought to understand all the bitterness of this life for me 
                here in Moscow. Is this life? I am not living, but waiting for 
                an event, which is continually put off and put off. No answer 
                again! And Stiva says he cannot go to Alexei Alexandrovich. And 
                I can't write again. I can do nothing, can begin nothing, can 
                alter nothing; I hold myself in, I wait, inventing amusements 
                for myself - the English family, writing, reading - but it's all 
                nothing but a sham, it's all the same as morphine. He ought to 
                feel for me,' she said, feeling tears of self-pity coming into 
                her eyes. </p>
              <p> She heard Vronsky's abrupt ring and hurriedly dried her tears 
                - not only dried her tears, but sat down by a lamp and opened 
                a book, affecting composure. She wanted to show him that she was 
                displeased that he had not come home as he had promised - displeased 
                only, and not on any account to let him see her distress, and, 
                least of all, her self-pity. She might pity herself, but he must 
                not pity her. She did not want strife, she blamed him for wanting 
                to quarrel, but unconsciously put herself into an attitude of 
                antagonism. </p>
              <p> `Well, you've not been dull?' he said, eagerly and good-humoredly, 
                going up to her. `What a terrible passion it is - gambling!' </p>
              <p> `No, I've not been dull; I've learned long ago not to be dull. 
                Stiva has been here, and Levin.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, they meant to come and see you. Well, how did you like 
                Levin?' he said, sitting down beside her. </p>
              <p> `Very much. They have not been gone long. What was Iashvin doing?' 
              </p>
              <p> `He was winning - seventeen thousand. I got him away. He had 
                really started home, but he went back again, and now he's losing.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Then what did you stay for?' she asked, suddenly lifting her 
                eyes to him. The expression of her face was cold and ungracious. 
                `You told Stiva you were staying on to get Iashvin away. And you 
                have left him there.' </p>
              <p> The same expression of cold readiness for the conflict appeared 
                on his face too. </p>
              <p> `In the first place, I did not ask him to give you any message; 
                and secondly, I never tell lies. But the chief point is, I wanted 
                to stay, and I stayed,' he said, frowning. `Anna, what is it for, 
                why will you do this?' he said after a moment's silence, bending 
                over toward her; and he opened his hand, hoping she would lay 
                hers in it. </p>
              <p> She was glad of this appeal for tenderness. But some strange 
                force of evil would not let her give herself up to her feelings, 
                as though the rules of warfare would not permit her to surrender. 
              </p>
              <p> `Of course you wanted to stay, and you stayed. You do everything 
                you want to. But what do you tell me that for? With what object?' 
                she said, getting more and more excited. `Does anyone contest 
                your rights? But you want to be right, and you're welcome to be 
                right.' </p>
              <p> His hand closed, he turned away, and his face wore a still more 
                obstinate expression. </p>
              <p> `For you it's a matter of obstinacy,' she said, watching him 
                intently and suddenly finding the right word for that expression 
                that irritated her, `simply obstinacy. For you it's a question 
                of whether you keep the upper hand of me, while for me...' Again 
                she felt sorry for herself, and she almost burst into tears. `If 
                you knew what it is for me! When I feel as I do now, that you 
                are hostile - yes, hostile to me - if you knew what this means 
                for me! If you knew how I feel on the brink of calamity at this 
                instant, how afraid I am of myself!' And she turned away, hiding 
                her sobs. </p>
              <p> `But what are you talking about?' he said, horrified at her 
                expression of despair and again bending over her, he took her 
                hand and kissed it. `What is it for? Do I seek amusements outside 
                our home? Don't I avoid the society of women?' </p>
              <p> `Well, yes! If that were all!' she said. </p>
              <p> `Come, tell me what I ought to do to give you peace of mind? 
                I am ready to do anything to make you happy,' he said, touched 
                by her expression of despair; `what wouldn't I do to save you 
                from distress of any sort, as now, Anna!' he said. </p>
              <p> `It's nothing, nothing!' she said. `I don't know myself whether 
                it's the solitary life, my nerves... Come, don't let us talk of 
                it. What about the race? You haven't told me!' she inquired, trying 
                to conceal her triumph at the victory, which had been on her side 
                after all. </p>
              <p> He asked for supper, and began telling her about the races; 
                but in his tone, in his eyes, which became more and more cold, 
                she saw that he did not forgive her for her victory, that the 
                feeling of obstinacy with which she had been struggling had asserted 
                itself again in him. He was colder to her than before, as though 
                he were regretting his surrender. And she, remembering the words 
                that had given her the victory, `how I feel on the brink of calamity, 
                how afraid I am of myself,' saw that this weapon was a dangerous 
                one, and that it could not be used a second time. And she felt 
                that beside the love that bound them together there had grown 
                up between them some evil spirit of strife, which she could not 
                exorcise from his heart, and still less from her own. </p>

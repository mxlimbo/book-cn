                The levee was drawing to a close. People met as they were going 
                away, and gossiped of the latest news, of the newly bestowed honors, 
                and the changes in the positions of the higher functionaries. 
              </p>
              <p>`If only Countess Marya Borissovna were Minister of War, and 
                Princess Vatkovsky were Commander in Chief,' said a gray-headed, 
                little old man in a gold-embroidered uniform, addressing a tall, 
                handsome maid of honor who had questioned him about the new appointments. 
              </p>
              <p> `And if I were one of the adjutants,' said the maid of honor, 
                smiling. </p>
              <p> `You have an appointment already. You're over the Ecclesiastical 
                Department. And your assistant's Karenin.' </p>
              <p> `Good day, Prince!' said the little old man to a man who came 
                up to him. </p>
              <p> `What were you saying of Karenin?' said the Prince. </p>
              <p> `He and Putiatov have received the order of Alexandre Nevsky.' 
              </p>
              <p> `I thought he had it already.' </p>
              <p> `No. Just look at him,' said the little old man, pointing with 
                his embroidered hat to Karenin in a Court uniform, with the new 
                red ribbon across his shoulders, standing in the doorway of the 
                hall with an influential member of the Imperial Council. `Pleased 
                and happy as brass,' he added, stopping to shake hands with a 
                handsome gentleman of the bedchamber of colossal proportions. 
              </p>
              <p> `No - he's looking older,' said the gentleman of the bedchamber. 
              </p>
              <p> `From overwork. He's always drawing up projects nowadays. He 
                won't let a poor devil go nowadays till he's explained it all 
                to him under heads.' </p>
              <p> `Looking older, did you say? Il fait des passions. I believe 
                Countess Lidia Ivanovna's jealous now of his wife.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, come now, please don't say any harm of Countess Lidia Ivanovna.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Why, is there any harm in her being in love with Karenin?' 
              </p>
              <p> `But is it true Madame Karenina's here?' </p>
              <p> `Well, not here in the palace, but in Peterburg. I met her yesterday 
                with Alexei Vronsky, bras dessus, bras dessous, on the Morskaia.' 
              </p>
              <p> `C'est un homme qui n'a pas...' the gentleman of the bedchamber 
                was beginning, but he stopped to make room, bowing, for a member 
                of the Imperial family to pass. </p>
              <p> Thus people talked incessantly of Alexei Alexandrovich, finding 
                fault with him and laughing at him, while he, blocking up the 
                way of the member of the Imperial Council he had captured, was 
                explaining to him point by point his new financial project, never 
                interrupting his discourse for an instant for fear he should escape. 
              </p>
              <p> Almost at the same time that his wife left Alexei Alexandrovich 
                there had come to him that bitterest moment in the life of an 
                official - the moment when his upward career comes to a full stop. 
                This full stop had arrived and everyone perceived it, but Alexei 
                Alexandrovich himself was not yet aware that his career was over. 
                Whether it was due to his feud with Stremov, or his misfortune 
                with his wife, or simply that Alexei Alexandrovich had reached 
                his predestined limits, it had become evident to everyone in the 
                course of that year that his career was at an end. He still filled 
                a position of consequence, he sat on many commissions and committees, 
                but he was a man whose day was over, and from whom nothing was 
                expected. Whatever he said, whatever he proposed, was heard as 
                though it were something long familiar, and the very thing that 
                was not needed. But Alexei Alexandrovich was not aware of this, 
                and, on the contrary, being cut off from direct participation 
                in governmental activity, he saw more clearly than ever the errors 
                and defects in the action of others, and thought it his duty to 
                point out means for their correction. Shortly after his separation 
                from his wife, he began writing his first note on the new judicial 
                procedure, the first of the endless series of notes he was destined 
                to write in the future. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich did not merely fail to observe his hopeless 
                position in the official world, he was not merely free from anxiety 
                on this head - he was positively more satisfied than ever with 
                his own activity. </p>
              <p> `He that is married careth for the things of the world, how 
                he may please his wife; he that is unmarried careth for the things 
                that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord,' says the 
                Apostle Paul, and Alexei Alexandrovich, who was now guided in 
                every action by Scripture, often recalled this text. It seemed 
                to him that ever since he had been left without a wife, he had, 
                in these very projects of reform, been serving the Lord more zealously 
                than ever. </p>
              <p> The unmistakable impatience of the member of the Council trying 
                to get away from him did not trouble Alexei Alexandrovich; he 
                gave up his exposition only when the member of the Council, seizing 
                his chance when one of the Imperial family was passing, slipped 
                away from him. </p>
              <p> Left alone, Alexei Alexandrovich looked down, collecting his 
                thoughts, then looked casually about him and walked toward the 
                door, where he hoped to meet Countess Lidia Ivanovna. </p>
              <p> `And how strong they all are - how sound physically,' thought 
                Alexei Alexandrovich, looking at the powerfully built gentleman 
                of the bedchamber with his well-groomed, perfumed whiskers, and 
                at the red neck of the Prince, pinched by his tight uniform. He 
                had to pass them on his way. `Truly is it said that all the world 
                is evil,' he thought, with another sidelong glance at the calves 
                of the gentleman of the bedchamber. </p>
              <p> Moving forward deliberately, Alexei Alexandrovich bowed with 
                his customary air of weariness and dignity to the gentleman who 
                had been talking about him, and, looking toward the door, his 
                eyes sought Countess Lidia Ivanovna. </p>
              <p> `Ah! Alexei Alexandrovich!' said the little old man, with a 
                malicious light in his eyes, at the moment when Karenin had come 
                up to them, and was nodding with a frigid gesture. `I haven't 
                congratulated you yet,' said the old man, pointing to his newly 
                received ribbon. </p>
              <p> `Thank you,' answered Alexei Alexandrovich. `What an exquisite 
                day today,' he added, laying emphasis in his peculiar way on the 
                word exquisite. </p>
              <p> That they laughed at him he was well aware, but he did not expect 
                anything but hostility from them; he was used to that by now. 
              </p>
              <p> Catching sight of the yellow shoulders of Lidia Ivanovna jutting 
                out above her corset, and her fine pensive eyes summoning him 
                to her, Alexei Alexandrovich smiled, revealing untarnished white 
                teeth, and went toward her. </p>
              <p> Lidia Ivanovna's dress had cost her great pains, as indeed all 
                her dresses had done of late. Her aim in dress was now quite the 
                reverse of what she had pursued thirty years before. Then her 
                desire had been to adorn herself with something, and the more 
                adorned the better. Now, on the contrary, she was perforce decked 
                out in a way so inconsistent with her age and her figure, that 
                her one anxiety was to contrive that the contrast between these 
                adornments and her own exterior should not be too appalling. And 
                as far as Alexei Alexandrovich was concerned she succeeded, and 
                was in his eyes attractive. For him she was the one island not 
                only of good will to him, but of love in the midst of the sea 
                of hostility and jeering that surrounded him. </p>
              <p> Passing through rows of ironical eyes, he was drawn as naturally 
                to her loving glance as a plant to the sun. </p>
              <p> `I congratulate you,' she said to him, her eyes on his ribbon. 
              </p>
              <p> Suppressing a smile of pleasure, he shrugged his shoulders, 
                closing his eyes, as though to say that that could not be a source 
                of joy to him. Countess Lidia Ivanovna was very well aware that 
                it was one of his chief sources of satisfaction, though he never 
                admitted it. </p>
              <p> `How is our angel?' said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, meaning Seriozha. 
              </p>
              <p> `I can't say I was quite pleased with him,' said Alexei Alexandrovich, 
                raising his eyebrows and opening his eyes. `And Sitnikov is not 
                satisfied with him.' (Sitnikov was the tutor to whom Seriozha's 
                secular education had been intrusted.) `As I have mentioned to 
                you, there's a sort of coldness in him toward the most important 
                questions which ought to touch the heart of every man and every 
                child....' Alexei Alexandrovich began expounding his views on 
                the sole question that interested him outside the service - the 
                education of his son. </p>
              <p> When Alexei Alexandrovich, with Lidia Ivanovna's help, had been 
                brought back anew to life and activity, he felt it his duty to 
                undertake the education of the son left on his hands. Having never 
                before taken any interest in educational questions, Alexei Alexandrovich 
                devoted some time to the theoretical study of the subject. After 
                reading several books on anthropology, education, and didactics, 
                Alexei Alexandrovich drew up a plan of education, and, engaging 
                the best tutor in Peterburg to superintend it, he set to work, 
                and the subject continually absorbed him. </p>
              <p> `Yes - but the heart! I see in him his father's heart, and with 
                such a heart a child cannot go far wrong,' said Lidia Ivanovna 
                with enthusiasm. </p>
              <p> `Yes, perhaps.... As for me, I do my duty. It's all I can do.' 
              </p>
              <p> `You're coming to me,' said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, after a 
                pause; `we have to speak of a subject painful for you. I would 
                give anything to have spared you certain memories, but others 
                are not of the same mind. I have received a letter from her. She 
                is here in Peterburg.' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich shuddered at the allusion to his wife, 
                but immediately his face assumed the deathlike rigidity which 
                expressed utter helplessness in the matter. </p>
              <p> `I was expecting it,' he said. </p>
              <p> Countess Lidia Ivanovna looked at him ecstatically, and tears 
                of rapture at the greatness of his soul came into her eyes. </p>

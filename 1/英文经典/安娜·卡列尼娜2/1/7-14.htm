              <p><br>
                The doctor was not yet up, and the footman said that `he had been 
                up late, and had given orders not to be waked, but would get up 
                soon.' The footman was cleaning the lamp chimneys, and seemed 
                very busy about them. This concentration of the footman upon his 
                lamps, and his indifference to what was passing in Levin, at first 
                astounded him, but immediately on considering the question he 
                realized that no one knew or was bound to know his feelings, and 
                that it was all the more necessary to act calmly, sensibly, and 
                resolutely to get through this wall of indifference and attain 
                his aim. `Don't be in a hurry or let anything slip,' Levin said 
                to himself, feeling a greater and greater flow of physical energy 
                and attention to all he had yet to do. </p>
              <p>Having ascertained that the doctor was not getting up, Levin 
                considered various plans, and decided on the following one; that 
                Kouzma should go for another doctor, while he himself should go 
                to the chemist's for opium, and if, when he came back, the doctor 
                had not yet begun to get up, he would, either by tipping the footman, 
                or by force, wake the doctor at all hazards. </p>
              <p> At the chemist's the lank pharmacist wafered a packet of powders 
                for a coachman who stood waiting, and refused him opium with the 
                same callousness with which the doctor's footman had cleaned his 
                lamp chimneys. Trying not to get flustered or out of temper, Levin 
                mentioned the names of the doctor and midwife, and explaining 
                what the opium was needed for, tried to persuade him. The assistant 
                inquired in German whether he should give it, and receiving an 
                affirmative reply from behind the partition, he took out a bottle 
                and a funnel, deliberately poured the opium from a bigger bottle 
                into a little one, stuck on a label, sealed it up, in spite of 
                Levin's request that he would not do so, and was about to wrap 
                it up too. This was more than Levin could stand; he took the bottle 
                firmly out of his hands, and ran to the big glass doors. The doctor 
                was not even now getting up, and the footman, busy now in putting 
                down the rugs, refused to wake him. Levin deliberately took out 
                a ten-rouble note, and careful to speak slowly, though losing 
                no time over the business, he handed him the note, and explained 
                that Piotr Dmitrievich (what a great and important personage he 
                seemed to Levin now, this Piotr Dmitrievich, who had been of so 
                little consequence in his eyes before) had promised to come at 
                any time; that he would certainly not be angry! And that he must 
                therefore wake him at once. </p>
              <p> The footman agreed, and went upstairs, taking Levin into the 
                waiting room. </p>
              <p> Levin could hear through the door the doctor coughing, moving 
                about, washing, and saying something. Three minutes passed; it 
                seemed to Levin that more than an hour had gone by. He could not 
                wait any longer. </p>
              <p> `Piotr Dmitrievich, Piotr Dmitrievich?' he said in an imploring 
                voice at the open door. `For God's sake, forgive me! See me as 
                you are. It's been going on more than two hours already.' </p>
              <p> `In a minute; in a minute!' answered a voice, and to his amazement 
                heard that the doctor was smiling as he spoke. </p>
              <p> `For one instant!'... </p>
              <p> `In a minute.' </p>
              <p> Two minutes more passed while the doctor was putting on his 
                boots, and two minutes more while the doctor put on his coat and 
                combed his hair. </p>
              <p> `Piotr Dmitrievich!' Levin was beginning again in a plaintive 
                voice, just as the doctor came in, dressed and ready. `These people 
                have no conscience,' thought Levin. `Combing his hair, while we're 
                dying!' </p>
              <p> `Good morning!' the doctor said to him, shaking hands, and, 
                as it were, teasing him with his composure. `There's no hurry. 
                Well, now?' </p>
              <p> Trying to be as accurate as possible, Levin began to tell him 
                every unnecessary detail of his wife's condition, interrupting 
                his account repeatedly with entreaties that the doctor would come 
                with him at once. </p>
              <p> `Oh, you needn't be in any hurry. You don't understand, you 
                know. I'm certain I'm not wanted; still I've promised, and, if 
                you like, I'll come. But there's no hurry. Please sit down; won't 
                you have some coffee?' </p>
              <p> Levin stared at him with eyes that asked whether he was laughing 
                at him; but the doctor had no notion of making fun of him. </p>
              <p> `I know, I know,' the doctor said, smiling; `I'm a married man 
                myself; and at these moments we husbands are very much to be pitied. 
                I've a patient whose husband always takes refuge in the stables 
                on such occasions.' </p>
              <p> `But what do you think, Piotr Dmitrievich? Do you suppose it 
                will go all right?' </p>
              <p> `Everything points to a favorable issue.' </p>
              <p> `So you'll come immediately?' said Levin, looking wrathfully 
                at the servant who was bringing in the coffee. </p>
              <p> `In just an hour.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, for God's sake!' </p>
              <p> `Well, let me drink my coffee, anyway.' </p>
              <p> The doctor started upon his coffee. Both were silent. </p>
              <p> `The Turks are really getting beaten, though. Did you read yesterday's 
                telegrams?' said the doctor, thoroughly masticating a roll. </p>
              <p> `No, I can't stand it!' said Levin, jumping up. `So you'll be 
                with us in a quarter of an hour?' </p>
              <p> `In half an hour.' </p>
              <p> `On your honor?' </p>
              <p> When Levin got home, he drove up at the same time as the Princess, 
                and they went up to the bedroom together. The Princess had tears 
                in her eyes, and her hands were shaking. Seeing Levin, she embraced 
                him, and burst into tears. </p>
              <p> `Well, my dear Lizaveta Petrovna?' she queried, clasping the 
                hand of the midwife, who came out to meet them with a beaming 
                and anxious face. </p>
              <p> `Everything is going on well,' she said; `persuade her to lie 
                down. She will feel easier that way.' </p>
              <p> From the moment when he had waked up and understood what was 
                going on, Levin had prepared his mind to bear resolutely what 
                was before him, and without considering or anticipating anything, 
                to avoid upsetting his wife, and, on the contrary, to soothe her 
                and keep up her courage. Without allowing himself even to think 
                of what was to come, of how it would end, judging from his inquiries 
                as to the usual duration of these ordeals, Levin had in his imagination 
                braced himself to bear up and to keep a tight rein on his feelings 
                for five hours, and it had seemed to him he could do this. But 
                when he came back from the doctor's and saw her sufferings again, 
                he fell to repeating more and more frequently: `Lord, have mercy 
                on us, and succor us!' He sighed, and flung his head up, and began 
                to feel afraid he could not bear it, that he would burst into 
                tears or run away - such agony it was to him. Yet only one hour 
                had passed. </p>
              <p> But after that hour there passed another hour, two hours, three, 
                the full five hours he had fixed as the furthest limit of his 
                sufferings, and the situation was still unchanged; and he was 
                still bearing it because there was nothing to be done but bear 
                it - every instant feeling that he had reached the utmost limits 
                of his endurance, and that his heart would break with sympathy 
                and pain. </p>
              <p> But still the minutes passed by, and the hours, and still more 
                hours, and his misery and horror grew and were more and more intense. 
              </p>
              <p> All the ordinary conditions of life, without which one can form 
                no conception of anything, had ceased to exist for Levin. He lost 
                all sense of time. Minutes - those minutes when she sent for him 
                and he held her moist hand, that would squeeze his hand with extraordinary 
                violence and then push it away - seemed to him hours, and hours 
                seemed to him minutes. He was surprised when Lizaveta Petrovna 
                asked him to light a candle behind a screen, and he found that 
                it was five o'clock in the afternoon. If he had been told it was 
                only ten o'clock in the morning he would not have been surprised. 
                Where he was all this time, he knew as little as the time of anything. 
                He saw her swollen face, sometimes bewildered and in agony, sometimes 
                smiling and trying to reassure him. He saw the old Princess too, 
                flushed and overwrought, with her gray curls in disorder, forcing 
                herself to gulp down her tears, biting her lips; he saw Dolly 
                too, and the doctor, smoking thick cigarettes, and Lizaveta Petrovna 
                with a firm, resolute, reassuring face, and the old Prince walking 
                up and down the hall with a frowning face. But why they came in 
                and went out, where they were, he did not know. The Princess was 
                with the doctor in the bedroom, then in the study, where a table 
                set for dinner suddenly appeared; then she was not there, but 
                Dolly was. Then Levin remembered he had been sent somewhere. Once 
                he had been sent to move a table and sofa. He had done this eagerly, 
                thinking it had to be done for her sake, and only later on he 
                found it was his own bed he had been getting ready. Then he had 
                been sent to the study to ask the doctor something. The doctor 
                had answered and then had said something about the irregularities 
                in the municipal council. Then he had been sent to the bedroom 
                to help the old Princess move the holy image in its silver-gilt 
                setting, and with the Princess's old waiting maid he had clambered 
                on a shelf to reach it and had broken the lampad, and the old 
                servant had tried to reassure him about the lampad and about his 
                wife, and he carried the holy image in and set it at the head 
                of Kitty's bed, carefully tucking the image in behind the pillow. 
                But where, when, and why all this had happened, he could not tell. 
                He did not understand why the old Princess took his hand, and 
                looking compassionately at him, begged him not to worry himself, 
                and Dolly persuaded him to eat something and led him out of the 
                room, and even the doctor looked seriously and with commiseration 
                at him, and offered him a drop of something. </p>
              <p> All he knew and felt was that what was happening was what had 
                happened nearly a year before in the hotel of the country town 
                at the deathbed of his brother Nikolai. But that had been grief 
                - this was joy. Yet that grief and this joy were alike outside 
                all the ordinary conditions of life; they were loopholes, as it 
                were, in that ordinary life, through which there came glimpses 
                of something sublime. And in the contemplation of this sublime 
                something the soul was exalted to inconceivable heights of which 
                it had before had no conception, while reason lagged behind, unable 
                to keep up with it. </p>
              <p> `Lord, have mercy on us, and succor us!' he repeated to himself 
                incessantly, feeling, in spite of his long and, as it seemed, 
                complete alienation from religion, that he turned to God just 
                as trustfully and simply as he had in his childhood and first 
                youth. </p>
              <p> All this time he had two distinct moods. One was away from her, 
                with the doctor, who kept smoking one thick cigarette after another 
                and extinguishing them on the edge of a full ash tray; with Dolly, 
                and with the old Prince, where there was talk about dinner, about 
                politics, about Maria Petrovna's illness, and where Levin suddenly 
                forgot for a minute what was happening, and felt as though he 
                had waked up from sleep; the other mood was in her presence, at 
                her pillow, where his heart seemed breaking, and still did not 
                break, from sympathetic suffering, and he prayed to God without 
                ceasing. And every time he was brought back from a moment of oblivion 
                by a scream reaching him from the bedroom, he fell into the same 
                strange terror that had come upon him the first minute. Every 
                time he heard a shriek, he jumped up, ran to justify himself, 
                remembered on the way that he was not to blame, and he longed 
                to defend her, to help her. But as he looked at her, he saw again 
                that help was impossible, and he was filled with terror and prayed: 
                `Lord, have mercy on us, and help us!' And as time went on, both 
                these moods became more intense; the calmer he became away from 
                her, completely forgetting her, the more agonizing became both 
                her sufferings and his feeling of helplessness before them. He 
                jumped up, would have liked to run away, but ran to her. </p>
              <p> Sometimes, when again and again she called upon him, he blamed 
                her; but seeing her submissive, smiling face, and hearing the 
                words `I am worrying you,' he threw the blame on God; but thinking 
                of God, at once he fell beseeching God to forgive him and have 
                mercy. </p>

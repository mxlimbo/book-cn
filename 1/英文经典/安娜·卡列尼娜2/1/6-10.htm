              <p><br>
                Vassenka drove the horses so fast that they reached the marsh 
                too early, while it was still hot. </p>
              <p>As they drew near this more important marsh, the chief aim of 
                their expedition, Levin could not help considering how he could 
                get rid of Vassenka and be free in his movements. Stepan Arkadyevich 
                evidently had the same desire, and on his face Levin saw the look 
                of anxiety always present in a true sportsman when beginning shooting, 
                together with a certain good-humored slyness peculiar to him. 
              </p>
              <p> `How shall we go? It's a splendid marsh, I see, and there are 
                hawks,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, pointing to two great birds hovering 
                over the sedge. `Where there are hawks, there is sure to be game.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Now, gentlemen,' said Levin, pulling up his boots and examining 
                the lock of his gun with a somewhat somber expression, `do you 
                see that sedge?' He pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the 
                huge half-mown wet meadow that stretched along the right bank 
                of the river. `The marsh begins here, straight in front of us, 
                do you see - where it is greener? From here it runs to the right 
                where the horses are; there are hummocks there, and double snipe, 
                and all round that sedge as far as that alder tree, and right 
                up to the mill. Over there, do you see, where the creek is? That's 
                the best place. There I once shot seventeen jacksnipe. We'll separate 
                with the dogs and go in different directions, and then meet over 
                there at the mill.' </p>
              <p> `Well, who'll go left, and who to the right?' asked Stepan Arkadyevich. 
                `It's wider to the right; you two go that way and I'll take the 
                left,' he said with apparent carelessness. </p>
              <p> `Capital! We'll make the bigger bag! Yes, come along, come along!' 
                Vassenka exclaimed. </p>
              <p> Levin could do nothing but agree, and they divided. </p>
              <p> As soon as they entered the marsh, the two dogs began hunting 
                about together and made toward the rust-colored spot. Levin knew 
                Laska's method, wary and indefinite; he knew the place too, and 
                expected a whole covey of snipe. </p>
              <p> `Veslovsky, walk beside me - beside me!' he said in a faint 
                voice to his companion splashing in the water behind him. Levin 
                could not help feeling an interest in the direction his gun was 
                pointed, after that casual shot near the Kolpensky marsh. </p>
              <p> `Oh, I won't get in your way, don't trouble about me.' </p>
              <p> But Levin could not help troubling, and recalled Kitty's words 
                at parting: `Mind you don't shoot one another.' The dogs came 
                nearer and nearer, passed each other, each pursuing its own scent. 
                The expectation of snipe was so intense that to Levin the smacking 
                sound of his own heel, as he drew it up out of the rusty mire, 
                seemed to be the call of a snipe, and he clutched and pressed 
                the butt of his gun. </p>
              <p> Bang! bang! sounded almost in his ear. Vassenka had fired at 
                a flock of ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying 
                at that moment toward the sportsmen, far out of range. Before 
                Levin had time to look round, there was the whir of one snipe, 
                another, a third, and some eight more rose one after another. 
              </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich hit one at the very moment when it was beginning 
                its zigzag movements, and the snipe fell as a clod into the quagmire. 
                Oblonsky aimed deliberately at another, still flying low toward 
                the sedge, and together with the report of the shot, that snipe 
                too fell, and it could be seen fluttering out where the sedge 
                had been cut, its unhurt wing showing white beneath. </p>
              <p> Levin was not so lucky: he aimed at his first bird too low, 
                and missed; he aimed at it again, just as it was rising, but at 
                that instant another snipe flew up at his very feet, distracting 
                him so that he missed again. </p>
              <p> While they were reloading their guns, another snipe rose, and 
                Veslovsky, who had had time to reload again, sent two charges 
                of small shot into the water. Stepan Arkadyevich picked up his 
                snipe, and with sparkling eyes looked at Levin. </p>
              <p> `Well, now let us separate,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, and limping 
                on his left foot, holding his gun in readiness and whistling to 
                his dog, he walked off in one direction. Levin and Veslovsky walked 
                off in the other. </p>
              <p> It always happened with Levin that when his first shots were 
                a failure he got heated and out of temper, and shot badly the 
                whole day. So was it that day. The snipe showed themselves in 
                numbers. They kept flying up from just under the dogs, from under 
                the sportsmen's legs, and Levin might have retrieved his ill luck. 
                But the more he shot, the more he felt disgraced in the eyes of 
                Veslovsky, who kept popping away merrily and indiscriminately, 
                killing nothing, and not in the slightest abashed by his ill success. 
                Levin, in feverish haste, could not restrain himself, got more 
                and more out of temper, and ended by shooting almost without a 
                hope of hitting. Laska, indeed, seemed to understand this. She 
                began searching more listlessly, and gazed back at the sportsmen 
                with apparent perplexity or reproach in her eyes. Shots followed 
                shots in rapid succession. The smoke of the powder hung about 
                the sportsmen, while in the great roomy net of the gamebag there 
                were only three light, small snipe. And of these one had been 
                killed by Veslovsky alone, and one by both of them together. Meanwhile, 
                from the other side of the marsh, came the sound of Stepan Arkadyevich's 
                shots, not frequent, but, as Levin fancied, well directed, for 
                almost after each they heard `Krak, Krak, apporte!' </p>
              <p> This excited Levin still more. The snipe were floating continually 
                in the air over the sedge. Their whirring wings close to the earth, 
                and their harsh cries high in the air, could be heard on all sides; 
                the snipe that had risen first and flown up into the air, settled 
                again before the sportsmen. Instead of two hawks there were now 
                dozens of them hovering with shrill cries over the marsh. </p>
              <p> After walking through the larger half of the marsh, Levin and 
                Veslovsky reached the place where the peasants' mowing grass was 
                divided into long strips reaching to the sedge, marked off in 
                one place by the trampled grass, in another by a path mown through 
                it. Half of these strips had already been mown. </p>
              <p> Though there was not so much hope of finding birds in the uncut 
                part as the cut part, Levin had promised Stepan Arkadyevich to 
                meet him, and so he walked on with his companion through the cut 
                and uncut patches. </p>
              <p> `Hi, hunters!' shouted one of a group of peasants, sitting on 
                an unharnessed telega: `Come and have some lunch with us! Have 
                a drop of wine!' </p>
              <p> Levin looked round. </p>
              <p> `Come along, it's all right!' shouted a good-humored-looking 
                bearded peasant with a red face, showing his white teeth in a 
                grin, and holding up a greenish bottle that flashed in the sunlight. 
              </p>
              <p> `Qu'est-ce qu'ils disent?' asked Veslovsky. </p>
              <p> `They invite you to have some vodka. Most likely they've been 
                dividing the meadow into lots. I should have some,' said Levin, 
                not without some guile, hoping Veslovsky would be tempted by the 
                vodka, and would go off to them. </p>
              <p> `Why do they offer it?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, they're merrymaking. Really, you should join them. You 
                would be interested.' </p>
              <p> `Allons, c'est curieux.' </p>
              <p> `You go, you go, you'll find the way to the mill!' cried Levin, 
                and looking round he perceived with satisfaction that Veslovsky, 
                bent and stumbling with weariness, holding his gun out at arm's 
                length, was making his way out of the marsh toward the peasants. 
              </p>
              <p> `You come too!' the peasant shouted to Levin. `Never fear! Taste 
                our pie!' </p>
              <p> Levin felt a strong inclination for a drink of vodka and a bite 
                of bread. He was exhausted, and felt it a great effort to drag 
                his staggering legs out of the mire, and for a minute he hesitated. 
                But Laska was pointing. And immediately all his weariness vanished, 
                and he walked lightly through the swamp toward the dog. A snipe 
                flew up at his feet; he fired and killed it. Laska still pointed. 
                - `Fetch it!' Another bird flew up close to the dog. Levin fired. 
                But it was an unlucky day for him; he missed it, and when he went 
                to look for the one he had shot, he could not find that either. 
                He wandered all about the sedge, but Laska did not believe he 
                had shot it, and when he sent her to find it, she pretended to 
                hunt for it, but did not really do so. </p>
              <p> And in the absence of Vassenka, on whom Levin threw the blame 
                of his failure, things went no better. There was plenty of snipe 
                still, but Levin made one miss after another. </p>
              <p> The slanting rays of the sun were still hot; his clothes, soaked 
                through with perspiration, stuck to his body; his left boot full 
                of water weighed heavily on his leg and squelched at every step; 
                the sweat ran in drops down his powder-grimed face, his mouth 
                was full of a bitter taste, his nose of the smell of powder and 
                stagnant water, his ears were ringing with the incessant whir 
                of the snipe; he could not touch the barrel of his gun, it was 
                so hot; his heart beat with short, rapid throbs; his hands shook 
                with excitement, and his weary legs stumbled and staggered over 
                the hummocks and in the swamp, but still he walked on and still 
                he shot. At last, after a disgraceful miss, he flung his gun and 
                his hat on the ground. </p>
              <p> `No, I must control myself,' he said to himself. Picking up 
                his gun and his hat, he called Laska, and went out of the swamp. 
                When he got onto dry ground he sat down on a hummock, pulled off 
                his boot and emptied it, then walked to the marsh, drank some 
                rust-tasting water, moistened the burning hot barrel of his gun, 
                and washed his face and hands. Feeling refreshed, he went back 
                to the spot where a snipe had settled, firmly resolved to keep 
                cool. </p>
              <p> He tried to be calm, but it was the same again. His finger pressed 
                the trigger before he had taken a good aim at the bird. It got 
                worse and worse. </p>
              <p> He had only five birds in his gamebag when he walked out of 
                the marsh toward the alders, where he was to rejoin Stepan Arkadyevich. 
              </p>
              <p> Before he caught sight of Stepan Arkadyevich he saw his dog. 
                Krak, black all over with the stinking mire of the marsh, darted 
                out from behind the twisted root of an alder, and, with the air 
                of a conqueror, sniffed Laska. Behind Krak there came into view 
                in the shade of the alder tree the shapely figure of Stepan Arkadyevich. 
                He came to meet him, red and perspiring, with unbuttoned neckband, 
                still limping in the same way. </p>
              <p> `Well? You have been popping away!' he said, smiling good-humoredly. 
              </p>
              <p> `How have you got on?' queried Levin. But there was no need 
                to ask, for he had already seen the full gamebag. </p>
              <p> `Oh, pretty fair.' </p>
              <p> He had fourteen birds. </p>
              <p> `A splendid marsh! I've no doubt Veslovsky got in your way. 
                It's awkward too, shooting with one dog,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                to soften his triumph. </p>

              <p><br>
                The day on which Sergei Ivanovich came to Pokrovskoe was one of 
                Levin's most painful days. </p>
              <p>It was the very busiest working time, when all the peasantry 
                show an extraordinary intensity of self-sacrifice in labor, such 
                as is not to be found in any other conditions of life and would 
                be highly esteemed if the men who showed these qualities themselves 
                thought highly of them, and if it were not repeated every year, 
                and if the results of this intense labor were not so simple. </p>
              <p> To reap and bind and cart off the rye and oats; to mow the meadows, 
                turn over the fallows, thresh the seed and sow the winter corn 
                - all this seems so simple and ordinary; but to succeed in getting 
                through it all everyone in the village, from the old man to the 
                young child, must toil incessantly for three or four weeks, three 
                times as hard as usual, living on kvass, onions, and black bread, 
                threshing and carrying the sheaves at night, and not giving more 
                than two or three hours in the twenty-four to sleep. And every 
                year this is done all over Russia. </p>
              <p> Having lived the greater part of his life in the country and 
                in the closest relations with the peasants, Levin always felt 
                in this busy time that he was infected by this general quickening 
                of energy in the people. </p>
              <p> In the early morning he rode over to the first sowing of the 
                rye, and to the oats, which were being carried to the stacks, 
                and, returning home at the time his wife and sister-in-law were 
                getting up, he drank coffee with them and walked to the grange, 
                where a new threshing machine was to be set working to get ready 
                the seed. </p>
              <p> All this day Levin, while talking with the bailiff and the peasants, 
                and, at home, with his wife, and Dolly, and her children, and 
                his father-in-law, kept on thinking of one thing, and one thing 
                only - that which at this time engrossed him most outside of the 
                cares of his estate; and in everything he sought a relation to 
                his questioning: `What am I, then? And where am I? And why am 
                I here?' </p>
              <p> He was standing in the cool threshing barn, still fragrant with 
                the leaves of the hazel branches interlaced on the freshly peeled 
                aspen beams of the new thatch roof. He gazed through the open 
                door in which the dry bitter chaff dust swirled and played; at 
                the grass of the threshing floor in the sunlight and the fresh 
                straw that had been brought in from the barn; then at the speckly-headed, 
                white-breasted swallows that flew chirping in under the roof and, 
                fluttering their wings, settled in the crevices of the doorway; 
                then at the peasants bustling in the dark, dusty barn, and he 
                thought strange thoughts. </p>
              <p> `Why is all this being done?' he thought. `Why am I standing 
                here, making them work? What are they all so busy for, trying 
                to show their zeal before me? For what reason is old Matriona, 
                my old friend, toiling? (I doctored her, when the beam fell on 
                her in the fire),' he thought, looking at a thin old woman who 
                was raking up the grain, moving painfully with her bare, sun-blackened 
                feet over the uneven, rough floor. `Then she recovered, but today 
                or tomorrow or in ten years she won't; they'll bury her, and nothing 
                will be left either of her or of that dashing woman in the red 
                skirt, who with that skillful, gentle action is shaking the ears 
                out of their husks. They'll bury her, as well as this piebald 
                gelding, and very soon too,' he thought, gazing at the heavily 
                moving, panting horse that kept walking up the treadwheel that 
                turned under him. `And they will bury her, and Fiodor the thresher 
                with his curly beard full of chaff, and his shirt torn on his 
                white shoulders - they will bury him. He's untying the sheaves, 
                and giving orders, and shouting to the women, and quickly setting 
                straight the strap on the moving wheel. And what's more, it's 
                not them alone - they'll bury me too, and nothing will be left. 
                What for? ' </p>
              <p> He thought this, and at the same time looked at his watch to 
                reckon how much they threshed in an hour. He wanted to know this 
                so as to judge by it the task to set for the day. </p>
              <p> `It'll soon be one, and they're only beginning the third sheaf,' 
                thought Levin. He went up to the man who was feeding the machine, 
                and shouting over the roar of the machine, he told him to feed 
                it more slowly. </p>
              <p> `You put in too much at a time, Fiodor. Do you see - it gets 
                choked, that's why it isn't getting on. Do it evenly.' </p>
              <p> Fiodor, black with the dust that clung to his moist face, shouted 
                something in response, but still went on doing as Levin did not 
                want him to. </p>
              <p> Levin, going up to the machine, moved Fiodor aside, and began 
                feeding the machine himself. </p>
              <p> Working on till the peasants' dinner hour, which was not long 
                in coming, he went out of the barn with Fiodor and fell into talk 
                with him, stopping beside a neat yellow sheaf of rye laid on the 
                threshing floor for seed. </p>
              <p> Fiodor came from a village at some distance from the one in 
                which Levin had once allotted land to his co-operative association. 
                Now it had been let to the innkeeper. </p>
              <p> Levin talked to Fiodor about this land and asked whether Platon, 
                a well-to-do peasant of good character belonging to the same village, 
                would not take the land for the coming year. </p>
              <p> `It's a high rent; it wouldn't pay Platon, Konstantin Dmitrich,' 
                answered the peasant, picking the ears off his sweat-drenched 
                shirt. </p>
              <p> `But how does Kirillov make it pay?' </p>
              <p> `Mitukha!' (So the peasant called the innkeeper in a tone of 
                contempt.) `You may be sure he'll make it pay, Konstantin Dmitrich! 
                He'll get his share, however he has to squeeze to get it! He's 
                no mercy on a peasant. But Uncle Fokanich' (so he called the old 
                peasant Platon) - `do you suppose he'd flay the skin off a man? 
                Where there's debt, he'll let anyone off. And he'll suffer losses. 
                He's human, too.' </p>
              <p> `But why will he let anyone off?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, well, of course, folks are different. One man lives for 
                his own wants and nothing else, like Mitukha, thinking only of 
                filling his belly; but Fokanich is a righteous old man. He lives 
                for his soul. He does not forget God.' </p>
              <p> `How does he think of God? How does he live for his soul?' Levin 
                almost shouted. </p>
              <p> `Why, to be sure, in truth, in God's way. Folks are different. 
                Take you, now - you wouldn't wrong a man...' </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes - good-by!' said Levin, breathless with excitement, 
                and turning round he took his stick and walked quickly away toward 
                home. At the peasant's words that Fokanich lived for his soul, 
                in truth, in God's way, undefined but significant ideas seemed 
                to burst forth, as though they had been locked up, and, all of 
                them striving toward one goal, they thronged whirling through 
                his head, blinding him with their light. </p>

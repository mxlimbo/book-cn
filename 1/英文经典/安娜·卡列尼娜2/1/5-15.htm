                They had just come back from Moscow, and were glad to be alone. 
                He was sitting at the writing table in his study, writing. She, 
                wearing the dark lilac dress she had worn during the first days 
                of their married life, and put on again today - a dress particularly 
                remembered and loved by him - was sitting on the sofa, the same 
                old-fashioned leather sofa which had always stood in the study 
                in Levin's father's and grandfather's days. She was sewing at 
                broderie anglaise. He thought and wrote, never losing the happy 
                consciousness of her presence. His work, both on the land and 
                on the book, in which the principles of the new land system were 
                to be laid down, had not been abandoned; but just as formerly 
                his work and ideas had seemed to him petty and trivial in comparison 
                with the darkness that overspread all life, now they seemed as 
                unimportant and petty in comparison with the life that lay before 
                him suffused with the brilliant light of happiness. He went on 
                with his work, but he felt now that the center of gravity of his 
                attention had passed to something else, and that consequently 
                he looked at his work quite differently and more clearly. Formerly 
                this work had been for him an escape from life. Formerly he had 
                felt that without this work his life would be too gloomy. Now 
                this work was necessary for him so that life might not be too 
                uniformly bright. Taking up his manuscript, reading through what 
                he had written, he found with pleasure that the work was worth 
                his working at. Many of his old ideas seemed to him superfluous 
                and extreme, but many blanks became distinct to him when he reviewed 
                the whole thing in his memory. He was writing now a new chapter 
                on the causes of the present disadvantageous condition of agriculture 
                in Russia. He maintained that the poverty of Russia arises not 
                merely from the anomalous distribution of landed property and 
                from misdirected reforms, but that what had contributed of late 
                years to this result was a civilization from without, abnormally 
                grafted upon Russia - especially facilities of communication such 
                as railways, leading to centralization in towns, the development 
                of luxury, and the consequent development of manufactures, credit, 
                and its accompaniment of speculation - all to the detriment of 
                agriculture. It seemed to him that in a normal development of 
                wealth in a state all these phenomena would arise only when a 
                considerable amount of labor had been put into agriculture, when 
                it had come under regular, or at least definite, conditions; that 
                the wealth of a country ought to increase proportionally, and 
                especially in such a way that other sources of wealth should not 
                outstrip agriculture; that in harmony with a certain stage of 
                agriculture there should be means of communication corresponding 
                to it, and that in our unsettled condition of the land, railways, 
                called into being by political and not by economic needs, were 
                premature, and, instead of promoting agriculture, as was expected 
                of them, they were competing with agriculture and promoting the 
                development of manufactures and credit, and so arresting its progress; 
                and that just as the one-sided and premature development of one 
                organ in an animal would hinder its general development, so in 
                the general development of wealth in Russia, credit, facilities 
                of communication, manufacturing activity, indubitably necessary 
                in Europe, where they had arisen in their proper time, had with 
                us only done harm, by throwing into the background the chief question, 
                next in turn, of the organization of agriculture. </p>
              <p>While he was at his writing, she was thinking how unnaturally 
                cordial her husband had been to young Prince Charsky, who had, 
                with great want of tact, flirted with her the day before they 
                left Moscow. `He's jealous,' she thought. `My God! How sweet and 
                silly he is! He's jealous of me! If he only knew that all others 
                are no more to me than Piotr the cook!' she thought, looking at 
                his head and red neck with a feeling of possession strange to 
                herself. `Though it's a pity to take him from his work (but he 
                has plenty of time!), I must look at his face; will he feel I'm 
                looking at him? I wish he'd turn round.... I'll will him to!' 
                and she opened her eyes wide, as though to intensify the influence 
                of her gaze. </p>
              <p> `Yes, they draw away all the sap and give a false resplendence,' 
                he muttered, stopped writing, and, feeling that she was looking 
                at him and smiling, he looked round. </p>
              <p> `Well?' he queried, smiling, and getting up. </p>
              <p> `He looked round,' she thought. </p>
              <p> `It's nothing; I wanted you to look round,' she said, watching 
                him, and trying to guess whether he was vexed at being interrupted 
                or not. </p>
              <p> `How happy we are alone together! I am, that is,' he said, going 
                up to her with a radiant smile of happiness. </p>
              <p> `I'm just as happy. I'll never go anywhere, especially not to 
                Moscow.' </p>
              <p> `And what were you thinking about?' </p>
              <p> `I? I was thinking... No, no, go on writing; don't break off,' 
                she said, pursing up her lips, `and I must cut out these little 
                holes now, do you see?' </p>
              <p> She took up her scissors and began cutting them out. </p>
              <p> `No; tell me - what was it?' he said, sitting down beside her 
                and watching the circular motion of the tiny scissors. </p>
              <p> `Oh! what was I thinking about? I was thinking about Moscow, 
                about the nape of your neck.' </p>
              <p> `Why should I, of all people, have such happiness! It's unnatural. 
                Too good,' he said kissing her hand. </p>
              <p> `I feel quite the opposite; the better things are, the more 
                natural it seems to me.' </p>
              <p> `And you've got a little curl loose,' he said, carefully turning 
                her head round. `A little curl, oh yes. No, no, we are busy at 
                our work!' </p>
              <p> Work did not progress further, and they darted apart from one 
                another like culprits when Kouzma came in to announce that tea 
                was ready. </p>
              <p> `Have they come from town?' Levin asked Kouzma. </p>
              <p> `They've just come; they're unpacking the things.' </p>
              <p> `Come quickly,' she said to him as she went out of the study, 
                `or else I shall read the letters without you.' </p>
              <p> Left alone, after putting his manuscripts together in the new 
                portfolio bought by her, he washed his hands at the new washstand 
                with the new elegant fittings, which had all made their appearance 
                with her. Levin smiled at his own thoughts, and shook his head 
                disapprovingly at those thoughts; a feeling akin to remorse fretted 
                him. There was something shameful, effeminate, Capuan, as he called 
                it to himself, in his present mode of life. `It's not right to 
                go on like this,' he thought. `It'll soon be three months, and 
                I'm doing next to nothing. Today, almost for the first time, I 
                set to work seriously - and what happened? I did nothing but begin 
                and throw it aside. I have almost given up even my ordinary pursuits. 
                I scarcely walk or drive about at all to look after things on 
                my land. Either I am loath to leave her, or I see she's dull alone. 
                And I used to think that, before marriage, life was nothing much, 
                somehow didn't count, but that after marriage life began in earnest. 
                And here almost three months have passed, and I have spent my 
                time so idly and unprofitably. No, this won't do; I must begin. 
                Of course, it's not her fault. She's not to blame in any way. 
                I ought to be firmer myself, to maintain my masculine independence 
                of action; or else I shall get into such ways, and she'll get 
                used to them too.... Of course she's not to blame,' he told himself. 
              </p>
              <p> But it is hard for anyone who is dissatisfied not to blame someone 
                else, and especially the person nearest of all to one, for the 
                basis of one's dissatisfaction. And it vaguely came into Levin's 
                mind that she herself was not to blame (she could not be to blame 
                for anything), but what was to blame was her education, too superficial 
                and frivolous. (`That fool Charsky: I know she wanted to stop 
                him, but didn't know how to.') `Yes, apart from her interest in 
                the house (that she has), apart from dress and broderie anglaise, 
                she has no serious interests. No interest in my work, in the estate, 
                in the peasants, nor in music, though she's rather good at it, 
                nor in reading. She does nothing, and is perfectly satisfied.' 
                Levin, in his heart, censured this, and did not as yet understand 
                that she was preparing for that period of activity which was to 
                come for her when she would at once be the wife of her husband 
                and mistress of the house, and would bear, and nurse, and bring 
                up children. He knew not that she was instinctively aware of this, 
                and preparing herself for this time of terrible toil, did not 
                reproach herself for the moments of carelessness and happiness 
                in her love, which she was enjoying now, while gaily building 
                her nest for the future. </p>

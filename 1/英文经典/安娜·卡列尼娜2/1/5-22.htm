              <p><br>
                Alexei Alexandrovich had forgotten the Countess Lidia Ivanovna 
                but she had not forgotten him. At the bitterest moment of his 
                lonely despair she came to him, and, without waiting to be announced, 
                walked straight into his study. She found him as he was sitting 
                with his head in both hands. </p>
              <p>`J'ai forc¨¦ la consigne,' she said, walking in with rapid steps 
                and breathing hard with excitement and rapid exertion. `I have 
                heard all! Alexei Alexandrovich! Dear friend!' she went on, warmly 
                squeezing his hand in both of hers and gazing with her fine pensive 
                eyes into his. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich, frowning, got up, and, disengaging his 
                hand, moved a chair up for her. </p>
              <p> `Won't you sit down, Countess? I'm seeing no one because I'm 
                unwell, Countess,' he said, and his lips twitched. </p>
              <p> `Dear friend!' repeated Countess Lidia Ivanovna, never taking 
                her eyes off his, and suddenly her eyebrows rose at the inner 
                corners, describing a triangle on her forehead, her ugly yellow 
                face becoming still uglier, but Alexei Alexandrovich felt that 
                she was sorry for him and was preparing to cry. And he too was 
                softened; he snatched her plump hand and proceeded to kiss it. 
              </p>
              <p> `Dear friend!' she said in a voice breaking with emotion. `You 
                ought not to give way to grief. Your sorrow is a great one, but 
                you ought to find consolation.' </p>
              <p> `I am crushed, I am annihilated, I am no longer a man!' said 
                Alexei Alexandrovich, letting go her hand, but still gazing into 
                her brimming eyes. `My position is so awful because I can find 
                nowhere, I cannot find within me, strength to support me.' </p>
              <p> `You will find support; seek it - not in me, though I beseech 
                you to believe in my friendship,' she said, with a sigh. `Our 
                support is love, that love that He has vouchsafed us. His burden 
                is light,' she said, with the look of ecstasy Alexei Alexandrovich 
                knew so well. `He will be your support and your succor.' </p>
              <p> Although there was in these words a flavor of that sentimental 
                emotion at her own lofty feelings, and that new mystical fervor 
                which had lately gained ground in Peterburg, and which seemed 
                to Alexei Alexandrovich disproportionate, still it was pleasant 
                to him to hear this now. </p>
              <p> `I am weak. I am crushed. I foresaw nothing, and now I understand 
                nothing.' </p>
              <p> `Dear friend!' repeated Lidia Ivanovna. </p>
              <p> `It's not the loss of what I no longer have; it's not that!' 
                pursued Alexei Alexandrovich. `I do not grieve for that. But I 
                cannot help feeling ashamed before other people for the position 
                I am placed in. It is wrong, but I can't help it - I can't help 
                it.' </p>
              <p> `It was not you who performed that noble act of forgiveness, 
                at which I was moved to ecstasy, and everyone else too, but He, 
                working within your heart,' said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, raising 
                her eyes rapturously, `and so you cannot be ashamed of your act.' 
              </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich knit his brows, and, crooking his hands, 
                he cracked his fingers. </p>
              <p> `One must know all the details,' he said in his high voice. 
                `A man's strength has its limits, Countess, and I have reached 
                my limits. The whole day I have had to be making arrangements, 
                arrangements about household matters arising' (he emphasized the 
                word arising) `from my new, solitary position. The servants, the 
                governess, the accounts.... These pinpricks have stabbed me to 
                the heart, and I have not the strength to bear it. At dinner... 
                yesterday, I was almost getting up from the dinner table. I could 
                not bear the way my son looked at me. He did not ask me the meaning 
                of it all, but he wanted to ask, and I could not bear the look 
                in his eyes. He was afraid to look at me, but that is not all...' 
                Alexei Alexandrovich would have referred to the bill that had 
                been brought him, but his voice shook, and he stopped. That bill 
                on blue paper, for a hat and ribbons, he could not recall without 
                a rush of self-pity. </p>
              <p> `I understand, dear friend,' said Lidia Ivanovna. `I understand 
                it all. Succor and comfort you will find not in me, though I have 
                come only to aid you, if I can. If I could take from off you all 
                these petty, humiliating cares... I understand that a woman's 
                word, a woman's superintendence, is needed. You will intrust it 
                to me?' </p>
              <p> Silently and gratefully Alexei Alexandrovich squeezed her hand. 
              </p>
              <p> `Together we will take care of Seriozha. Practical affairs are 
                not my strong point. But I will set to work. I will be your housekeeper. 
                Don't thank me. I do it not from myself...' </p>
              <p> `I cannot help thanking you.' </p>
              <p> `But, dear friend, do not give way to the feeling of which you 
                spoke - being ashamed of what is the Christian's highest glory: 
                he who humbles himself shall be exalted. And you cannot thank 
                me. You must thank Him, and pray to Him for succor. In Him alone 
                we find peace, consolation, salvation, and love,' she said, and 
                turning her eyes heavenward, she began praying, as Alexei Alexandrovich 
                gathered from her silence. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich listened to her now, and those expressions 
                which had seemed to him, if not distasteful, at least exaggerated, 
                now seemed to him natural and consolatory. Alexei Alexandrovich 
                had disliked this new enthusiastic fervor. He was a believer, 
                who was interested in religion primarily in its political aspect, 
                and the new doctrine which ventured upon several new interpretations, 
                just because it paved the way to discussion and analysis, was 
                in principle disagreeable to him. He had hitherto taken up a cold 
                and even antagonistic attitude to this new doctrine, and with 
                Countess Lidia Ivanovna, who had been carried away by it, he had 
                never argued, but by silence had assiduously parried her attempts 
                to provoke him into argument. Now for the first time he heard 
                her words with pleasure, and did not inwardly oppose them. </p>
              <p> `I am very, very grateful to you, both for your deeds and for 
                your words,' he said, when she had finished praying. </p>
              <p> Countess Lidia Ivanovna once more squeezed both of her friend's 
                hands. </p>
              <p> `Now I will enter upon my duties,' she said with a smile after 
                a pause, as she wiped away the traces of tears. `I am going to 
                Seriozha. Only in the last extremity shall I apply to you.' And 
                she got up and went out. </p>
              <p> Countess Lidia Ivanovna went into Seriozha's part of the house, 
                and, dropping tears on the scared child's cheeks, she told him 
                that his father was a saint and his mother was dead. </p>
              <p> Countess Lidia Ivanovna kept her promise. She did actually take 
                upon herself the care of the organization and management of Alexei 
                Alexandrovich's household. But she had not overstated the case 
                when saying that practical affairs were not her strong point. 
                All her arrangements had to be modified because they could not 
                be carried out, and they were modified by Kornei, Alexei Alexandrovich's 
                valet, who, though no one was aware of the fact, now managed Karenin's 
                household, and quietly and discreetly reported to his master, 
                while the latter was dressing, all it was necessary for him to 
                know. But Lidia Ivanovna's help was none the less real; she gave 
                Alexei Alexandrovich moral support in the consciousness of her 
                love and respect for him, and still more (as it was soothing to 
                her to believe) by having almost turned him to Christianity - 
                that is, from an indifferent and apathetic believer she had turned 
                him into an ardent and steadfast adherent of the new interpretation 
                of Christian doctrine, which had been gaining ground of late in 
                Peterburg. It was easy for Alexei Alexandrovich to believe in 
                this teaching. Alexei Alexandrovich, like Lidia Ivanovna indeed, 
                and others who shared their views, was completely devoid of profundity 
                of imagination, that spiritual faculty in virtue of which the 
                ideas evoked by the imagination become so actual that they must 
                needs be in harmony with other ideas, and with reality itself. 
                He saw nothing impossible and absurd in the idea that death, though 
                existing for unbelievers, did not exist for him, and that, as 
                he was possessed of the most perfect faith, of the measure of 
                which he was himself the judge, there was therefore no sin in 
                his soul, and he was experiencing complete salvation here on earth. 
              </p>
              <p> It is true that the erroneousness and shallowness of this conception 
                of his faith was dimly perceptible to Alexei Alexandrovich, and 
                he knew that when, without the slightest idea that his forgiveness 
                was the action of a higher power, he had surrendered directly 
                to the feeling of forgiveness, he had felt more happiness than 
                now, when he was thinking every instant that Christ was in his 
                heart, and that in signing official papers he was doing His will. 
                But for Alexei Alexandrovich it was a necessity to think in that 
                way; it was such a necessity for him in his humiliation to have 
                some elevated standpoint, however imaginary, from which, looked 
                down upon by all, he could look down on others, that he clung, 
                as to his one salvation, to his delusion of salvation. </p>

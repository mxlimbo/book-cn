                Stepan Arkadyevich felt completely nonplused by the strange talk 
                which he was hearing for the first time. The complexity of Peterburg, 
                as a rule, had a stimulating effect on him, rousing him out of 
                his Moscow stagnation. But he liked these complications, and understood 
                them only in the circles he knew and was at home in. In these 
                unfamiliar surroundings he was puzzled and disconcerted, and could 
                not get his bearings. As he listened to Countess Lidia Ivanovna, 
                aware of the beautiful, na?ve - or perhaps knavish, he could not 
                decide which - eyes of Landau fixed upon him, Stepan Arkadyevich 
                began to be conscious of a peculiar heaviness in his head. </p>
              <p>The most incongruous ideas were in confusion in his head. `Marie 
                Sanina is glad her child's dead.... How good a smoke would be 
                now!... To be saved, one need only believe, and the monks don't 
                know how the thing's to be done, but Countess Lidia Ivanovna does 
                know.... And why is my head so heavy? Is it the cognac, or the 
                fact of all this being so very queer? Anyway, I fancy I've done 
                nothing unseemly so far. But, anyway, it won't do to ask her now. 
                They say they make one pray. I only hope they won't make me! That'll 
                be too imbecile. And what stuff it is she's reading! But she has 
                a good accent. Landau - Bezzubov - what's he Bezzubov for?' All 
                at once Stepan Arkadyevich became aware that his lower jaw was 
                uncontrollably forming a yawn. He pulled his whiskers to cover 
                the yawn, and shook himself together. But soon after he became 
                aware that he was dropping asleep and on the very point of snoring. 
                He recovered himself at the very moment when the voice of Countess 
                Lidia Ivanovna was saying `he's asleep.' </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich started with dismay, feeling guilty and caught. 
                But he was reassured at once by seeing that the words `he's asleep' 
                asleep referred not to him, but to Landau. The Frenchman had fallen 
                asleep as well as Stepan Arkadyevich. But Stepan Arkadyevich's 
                being asleep would have offended them, as he thought (though even 
                this, he thought, might not be so, as everything seemed so queer), 
                while Landau's being asleep delighted them extremely, especially 
                Countess Lidia Ivanovna. </p>
              <p> `Mon ami,' said Lidia Ivanovna, carefully holding the folds 
                of her silk gown so as not to rustle, and in her excitement calling 
                Karenin not Alexei Alexandrovich, but mon ami, `donnez-lui la 
                main. Vous voyez? Sh!' she hissed at the footman as he came in 
                again. `Not at home!' </p>
              <p> The Frenchman was asleep, or pretending to be asleep, with his 
                head on the back of his chair, and his moist hand, as it lay on 
                his knee, made faint movements, as though trying to catch something. 
                Alexei Alexandrovich got up, tried to move carefully, but stumbled 
                against the table, drew up, and laid his hand in the Frenchman's 
                hand. Stepan Arkadyevich got up too, and opening his eyes wide, 
                trying to wake himself up if he was asleep, he looked first at 
                one and then at the other. It was all real. Stepan Arkadyevich 
                felt that his head was getting worse and worse. </p>
              <p> `Que la personne qui est arriv¨¦e la derni¨¨re, celle qui demande, 
                qu'elle - sorte! Qu'elle sorte!' articulated the Frenchman, without 
                opening his eyes. </p>
              <p> `Vous m'excuserez, mais vous voyez... Revenez vers dix heures, 
                encore mieux demain.' </p>
              <p> `Qu'elle sorte!' repeated the Frenchman impatiently. </p>
              <p> `C'est moi, n'est-ce pas?' And receiving an answer in the affirmative, 
                Stepan Arkadyevich, forgetting the favor he had meant to ask of 
                Lidia Ivanovna, and forgetting his sister's affairs, caring for 
                nothing, but filled with the sole desire to escape as soon as 
                possible, went out on tiptoe and ran out into the street as though 
                from a plague-stricken house. For a long while he chatted and 
                joked with his driver, trying to recover his spirits. </p>
              <p> At the French theater where he arrived for the last act, and 
                afterward at the Tatar restaurant after his champagne, Stepan 
                Arkadyevich felt a little refreshed in the atmosphere he was used 
                to. But still he felt quite unlike himself all that evening. </p>
              <p> On getting home to Piotr Oblonsky's, where he was staying, Stepan 
                Arkadyevich found a note from Betsy. She wrote to him that she 
                was very anxious to finish their interrupted conversation, and 
                begged him to come the next day. He had scarcely read this note, 
                and frowned at its contents, when he heard below the ponderous 
                tramp of the servants carrying something heavy. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich went out to look. It was the rejuvenated 
                Piotr Oblonsky. He was so drunk that he could not walk upstairs; 
                but he told them to set him on his legs when he saw Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                and, clinging to him, walked with him into his room, and there 
                began telling him how he had spent the evening, and fell asleep 
                doing so. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich was in very low spirits, which happened rarely 
                with him, and for a long while he could not go to sleep. Everything 
                he could recall to his mind, everything was disgusting; but, most 
                disgusting of all, as if it were something shameful, was the memory 
                of the evening he had spent at Countess Lidia Ivanovna's. </p>
              <p> Next day he received from Alexei Alexandrovich a final answer, 
                refusing to grant Anna's divorce, and he understood that his decision 
                was based on what the Frenchman had said in his real or pretended 
                trance. </p>

                  <p>Str. But perhaps you mean to give the name of &quot;being&quot; 
                    to both of<br>
                    them together?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p> Theaet. Quite likely.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. &quot;Then, friends,&quot; we shall reply to them, &quot;the 
                    answer <br>
                    is plainly that the two will still be resolved into one.&quot;<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Most true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. &quot;Since then, we are in a difficulty, please to 
                    tell <br>
                    us what you mean, when you speak of being; for there can be 
                    no doubt that you always from the first understood your own 
                    meaning, whereas we once thought that we understood you, but 
                    now we are in a great strait. Please to begin by explaining 
                    this matter to us, and let us no longer fancy that we understand 
                    you, when we entirely misunderstand you.&quot; There will 
                    be no impropriety in our demanding an answer to this question, 
                    either of the dualists or of the pluralists?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And what about the assertors of the oneness of the all-must<br>
                    we not endeavour to ascertain from them what they mean by 
                    &quot;being&quot;?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. By all means.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then let them answer this question: One, you say, alone 
                    is?<br>
                    &quot;Yes,&quot; they will reply.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And there is something which you call &quot;being&quot;?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And is being the same as one, and do you apply two <br>
                    names to the same thing?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What will be their answer, Stranger?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. It is clear, Theaetetus, that he who asserts the <br>
                    unity of being will find a difficulty in answering this or 
                    any other question.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Why so?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. To admit of two names, and to affirm that there is nothing<br>
                    but unity, is surely ridiculous?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And equally irrational to admit that a name is anything?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How so?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. To distinguish the name from the thing, implies duality.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And yet he who identifies the name with the thing will 
                    be<br>
                    compelled to say that it is the name of nothing, or if he 
                    <br>
                    says that it is the name of something, even then the name 
                    will only be the name of a name, and of nothing else.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the one will turn out to be only one of one, and 
                    being<br>
                    absolute unity, will represent a mere name.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And would they say that the whole is other than the 
                    one that<br>
                    is, or the same with it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. To be sure they would, and they actually say so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. If being is a whole, as Parmenides sings,-</p>
                  <p> Every way like unto the fullness of a well-rounded sphere,<br>
                    Evenly balanced from the centre on every side,<br>
                    And must needs be neither greater nor less in any way,<br>
                    Neither on this side nor on that-</p>
                  <p>then being has a centre and extremes, and, having these, 
                    must also<br>
                    have parts.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yet that which has parts may have the attribute of <br>
                    unity in all the parts, and in this way being all and a whole, 
                    may be one?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But that of which this is the condition cannot be absolute<br>
                    unity?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Why not?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Because, according to right reason, that which is truly 
                    one<br>
                    must be affirmed to be absolutely indivisible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But this indivisible, if made up of many parts, will 
                    <br>
                    contradict reason.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I understand.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Shall we say that being is one and a whole, because 
                    it has<br>
                    the attribute of unity? Or shall we say that being is not 
                    a whole at<br>
                    all?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That is a hard alternative to offer.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Most true; for being, having in a certain sense the 
                    attribute<br>
                    of one, is yet proved not to be the same as one, and the all 
                    is<br>
                    therefore more than one.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And yet if being be not a whole, through having the 
                    attribute<br>
                    of unity, and there be such a thing as an absolute whole, 
                    being<br>
                    lacks something of its own nature?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Upon this view, again, being, having a defect of being, 
                    will<br>
                    become not-being?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And, again, the all becomes more than one, for being 
                    and the<br>
                    whole will each have their separate nature.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But if the whole does not exist at all, all the previous<br>
                    difficulties remain the same, and there will be the further<br>
                    difficulty, that besides having no being, being can never 
                    have come<br>
                    into being.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Why so?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Because that which comes into being always comes into 
                    being<br>
                    as a whole, so that he who does not give whole a place among 
                    beings, cannot speak either of essence or generation as existing.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, that certainly appears to be true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Again; how can that which is not a whole have any <br>
                    quantity? For that which is of a certain quantity must necessarily 
                    be the whole of that quantity.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Exactly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And there will be innumerable other points, each of 
                    them<br>
                    causing infinite trouble to him who says that being is either, 
                    one<br>
                    or two.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. The difficulties which are dawning upon us prove 
                    this; for<br>
                    one objection connects with another, and they are always involving<br>
                    what has preceded in a greater and worse perplexity.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. We are far from having exhausted the more exact thinkers 
                    who<br>
                    treat of being and not-being. But let us be content to leave 
                    <br>
                    them, and proceed to view those who speak less precisely; 
                    and we shall find as the result of all, that the nature of 
                    being is quite as difficult to comprehend as that of not-being.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Then now we will go to the others.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There appears to be a sort of war of Giants and Gods 
                    going on<br>
                    amongst them; they are fighting with one another about the 
                    nature of<br>
                    essence.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How is that?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Some of them are dragging down all things from heaven 
                    and<br>
                    from the unseen to earth, and they literally grasp in their 
                    hands<br>
                    rocks and oaks; of these they lay hold, and obstinately <br>
                    maintain, that the things only which can be touched or handled 
                    have being or essence, because they define being and body 
                    as one, and if any one else says that what is not a body exists 
                    they altogether despise him, and will hear of nothing but 
                    body.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I have often met with such men, and terrible fellows 
                    they<br>
                    are.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And that is the reason why their opponents cautiously 
                    defend<br>
                    themselves from above, out of an unseen world, mightily contending<br>
                    that true essence consists of certain intelligible and incorporeal<br>
                    ideas; the bodies of the materialists, which by them are <br>
                    maintained to be the very truth, they break up into little 
                    bits by their<br>
                    arguments, and affirm them to be, not essence, but generation 
                    and<br>
                    motion. Between the two armies, Theaetetus, there is always 
                    <br>
                    an endless conflict raging concerning these matters.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us ask each party in turn, to give an account of 
                    <br>
                    that which they call essence.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How shall we get it out of them?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. With those who make being to consist in ideas, there 
                    will be<br>
                    less difficulty, for they are civil people enough; but there 
                    will be<br>
                    very great difficulty, or rather an absolute impossibility, 
                    <br>
                    in getting an opinion out of those who drag everything down 
                    to matter. Shall I tell you what we must do?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us, if we can, really improve them; but if this 
                    is not<br>
                    possible, let us imagine them to be better than they are, 
                    and more<br>
                    willing to answer in accordance with the rules of argument, 
                    and then<br>
                    their opinion will be more worth having; for that which better 
                    men<br>
                    acknowledge has more weight than that which is acknowledged 
                    by<br>
                    inferior men. Moreover we are no respecters of persons, but 
                    seekers<br>
                    after time.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then now, on the supposition that they are improved, 
                    <br>
                    let us ask them to state their views, and do you interpret 
                    them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Agreed.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let them say whether they would admit that there is 
                    such a<br>
                    thing as a mortal animal.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Of course they would.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And do they not acknowledge this to be a body having 
                    a soul?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly they do.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Meaning to say the soul is something which exists?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And do they not say that one soul is just, and another<br>
                    unjust, and that one soul is wise, and another foolish?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And that the just and wise soul becomes just and wise 
                    by the<br>
                    possession of justice and wisdom, and the opposite under opposite<br>
                    circumstances?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, they do.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But surely that which may be present or may be absent 
                    will be<br>
                    admitted by them to exist?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And, allowing that justice, wisdom, the other virtues, 
                    and<br>
                    their opposites exist, as well as a soul in which they inhere, 
                    do they<br>
                    affirm any of them to be visible and tangible, or are they 
                    all<br>
                    invisible?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. They would say that hardly any of them are visible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And would they say that they are corporeal?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. They would distinguish: the soul would be said by 
                    them to<br>
                    have a body; but as to the other qualities of justice, <br>
                    wisdom, and the like, about which you asked, they would not 
                    venture either to deny their existence, or to maintain that 
                    they were all corporeal.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Verily, Theaetetus, I perceive a great improvement in 
                    <br>
                    them; the real aborigines, children of the dragon's teeth, 
                    would have been deterred by no shame at all, but would have 
                    obstinately asserted<br>
                    that nothing is which they are not able to squeeze in their 
                    hands.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That is pretty much their notion.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us push the question; for if they will admit that 
                    <br>
                    any, even the smallest particle of being, is incorporeal, 
                    it is enough; they must then say what that nature is which 
                    is common to both the<br>
                    corporeal and incorporeal, and which they have in their mind's 
                    eye<br>
                    when they say of both of them that they &quot;are.&quot; Perhaps 
                    they may be<br>
                    in a difficulty; and if this is the case, there is a possibility<br>
                    that they may accept a notion of ours respecting the nature 
                    of<br>
                    being, having nothing of their own to offer.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What is the notion? Tell me, and we shall soon see.<br>
                    Str. My notion would be, that anything which possesses any 
                    sort of<br>
                    power to affect another, or to be affected by another, if 
                    only for a<br>
                    single moment, however trifling the cause and however slight 
                    the<br>
                    effect, has real existence; and I hold that the definition 
                    <br>
                    of being is simply power of Theaet. They accept your suggestion, 
                    having nothing better of their own to offer.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Very good; perhaps we, as well as they, may one day 
                    change<br>
                    our minds; but, for the present, this may be regarded as the<br>
                    understanding which is established with them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Agreed.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us now go to the friends of ideas; of their opinions,<br>
                    too, you shall be the interpreter.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I will.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. To them we say-You would distinguish essence from generation?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. &quot;Yes,&quot; they reply.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And you would allow that we participate in <br>
                    generation, with the body, and through perception, but we 
                    participate with the soul through in true essence; and essence 
                    you would affirm to be always the same and immutable, whereas 
                    generation or becoming varies?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes; that is what we should affirm.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Well, fair sirs, we say to them, what is this participation,<br>
                    which you assert of both? Do you agree with our recent definition?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What definition?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. We said that being was an active or passive energy, 
                    <br>
                    arising out of a certain power which proceeds from elements 
                    meeting with one another. Perhaps your cars, Theaetetus, may 
                    fail to catch their answer, which I recognize because I have 
                    been accustomed to hear it.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. And what is their answer?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. They deny the truth of what we were just now, saying 
                    to the<br>
                    aborigines about existence.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What was that?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Any power of doing or suffering in a degree however 
                    slight<br>
                    was held by us to be a sufficient definition of being?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. They deny this, and say that the power of doing or <br>
                    suffering is confined to becoming, and that neither power 
                    is applicable to being.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. And is there not some truth in what they say?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes; but our reply will be that we want to ascertain 
                    from<br>
                    them more distinctly, whether they further admit that the 
                    soul<br>
                    knows, and that being or essence is known.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. There can be no doubt that they say so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And is knowing and being known, doing or suffering, 
                    <br>
                    or both, or is the one doing and the other suffering, or has 
                    neither any share in either?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Clearly, neither has any share in either; for if 
                    they say<br>
                    anything else, they will contradict themselves.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I understand; but they will allow that if to know is 
                    active,<br>
                    then, of course, to be known is passive. And on this view 
                    <br>
                    being, in so far as it is known, is acted upon by knowledge, 
                    and is therefore in motion; for that which is in a state of 
                    rest cannot be acted upon, as we affirm.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And, O heavens, can we ever be made to believe that 
                    motion<br>
                    and life and soul and mind are not present with perfect being? 
                    Can<br>
                    we imagine that, being is devoid of life and mind, and <br>
                    exists in awful unmeaningness an everlasting fixture?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That would be a dreadful thing to admit, Stranger.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But shall we say that has mind and not life?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How is that possible?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Or shall we say that both inhere in perfect being, but 
                    that<br>
                    it has no soul which contains them?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. And in what other way can it contain them?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Or that being has mind and life and soul, but although<br>
                    endowed with soul remains absolutely unmoved?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. All three suppositions appear to me to be irrational.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Under being, then, we must include motion, and that 
                    which is<br>
                    moved.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then, Theaetetus, our inference is, that if there is 
                    <br>
                    no motion, neither is there any mind anywhere, or about anything 
                    or belonging to any one.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And yet this equally follows, if we grant that all things 
                    are<br>
                    in motion-upon this view too mind has no existence.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How so?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Do you think that sameness of condition and mode and 
                    subject<br>
                    could ever exist without a principle of rest?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Can you see how without them mind could exist, or come 
                    into<br>
                    existence anywhere?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. No.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And surely contend we must in every possible way against 
                    him<br>
                    who would annihilate knowledge and reason and mind, and yet 
                    ventures to speak confidently about anything.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, with all our might.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then the philosopher, who has the truest reverence for 
                    these<br>
                    qualities, cannot possibly accept the notion of those who 
                    <br>
                    say that the whole is at rest, either as unity or in many 
                    forms: and he will be utterly deaf to those who assert universal 
                    motion. As children say entreatingly &quot;Give us both.&quot; 
                    so he will include both the moveable<br>
                    and immoveable in his definition of being and all.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Most true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And now, do we seem to have gained a fair notion of 
                    being?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes truly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Alas, Theaetetus, methinks that we are now only beginning 
                    to<br>
                    see the real difficulty of the enquiry into the nature of 
                    it.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. O my friend, do you not see that nothing can exceed 
                    out<br>
                    ignorance, and yet we fancy that we are saying something good?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I certainly thought that we were; and I do not at 
                    all<br>
                    understand how we never found out our desperate case.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Reflect: after having made, these admissions, may we 
                    not be<br>
                    justly asked, the same questions which we ourselves were asking 
                    of<br>
                    those who said that all was hot and cold?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What were they? Will you recall them to my mind?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. To be sure, I will remind you of them, by putting the 
                    same<br>
                    questions, to you which I did to them, and then we shall get 
                    on.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Would you not say that rest and motion are in the most 
                    entire<br>
                    opposition to one another?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Of course.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And yet you would say that both and either of them <br>
                    equally are?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I should.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And when you admit that both or either of them are, 
                    <br>
                    do you mean to say that both or either, of them are in motion?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Or do you wish to imply that they are both at rest, 
                    when you<br>
                    say that they are?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Of course not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then you conceive of being as some third and distinct 
                    nature,<br>
                    under which rest and motion are alike included; and, observing 
                    that<br>
                    they both participate in being, you declare that they are.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Truly we seem to have an intimation that being is 
                    <br>
                    some third thing, when we say that rest and motion are.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then being is not the combination of rest and motion, 
                    but<br>
                    something different from them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. So it would appear.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Being, then, according to its own nature, is neither 
                    in<br>
                    motion nor at rest.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That is very much the truth.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Where, then, is a man to look for help who would have 
                    <br>
                    any clear or fixed notion of being in his mind?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Where, indeed?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I scarcely think that he can look anywhere; for that 
                    which is<br>
                    not in motion must be at rest, and again, that which is not 
                    at rest<br>
                    must be in motion; but being is placed outside of both these<br>
                    classes. Is this possible?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Utterly impossible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Here, then, is another thing which we ought to bear 
                    in mind.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. When we were asked to what we were to assign the <br>
                    appellation of not-being, we were in the greatest difficulty:-do 
                    you remember?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. To be sure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And are we not now in as a difficulty about being?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaes. I should say, Stranger, that we are in one which 
                    is, if<br>
                    possible, even greater.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then let us acknowledge the difficulty; and as being 
                    and<br>
                    not-being are involved in the same perplexity, there is hope 
                    <br>
                    that when the one appears more or less distinctly, the other 
                    will equally appear; and if we are able to see neither there 
                    may still be a<br>
                    chance of steering our way in between them, without any great<br>
                    discredit.</p>
                  <p> Theaet. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us enquire, then, how we come to predicate many 
                    names of<br>
                    the same thing.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Give an example.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I mean that we speak of man, for example, under many 
                    <br>
                    names-that we attribute to him colours and forms and magnitudes 
                    and virtues and vices, in all of which instances and in ten 
                    thousand others we not only speak of him as a man, but also 
                    as good, and having number-less other attributes, and in the 
                    same way anything else which we originally supposed to be 
                    one is described by us as many, and under many names.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That is true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And thus we provide a rich feast for tyros, whether 
                    young or<br>
                    old; for there is nothing easier than to argue that the one 
                    cannot<br>
                    be many, or the many one; and great is their delight in <br>
                    denying that a man is good; for man, they insist, is man and 
                    good is good. I dare say that you have met with persons who 
                    take-an interest in such matters-they are often elderly men, 
                    whose meagre sense is thrown into amazement by these discoveries 
                    of theirs, which they believe to be the height of wisdom.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly, I have.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then, not to exclude any one who has ever speculated 
                    at all<br>
                    upon the nature of being, let us put our questions to them 
                    as well<br>
                    as to our former friends.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What questions?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Shall we refuse to attribute being to motion and rest, 
                    or<br>
                    anything to anything, and assume that they do not mingle, 
                    and are<br>
                    incapable of participating in one another? Or shall we <br>
                    gather all into one class of things communicable with one 
                    another? Or are some things communicable and others not?-Which 
                    of these alternatives,<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaetetus, will they prefer?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I have nothing to answer on their behalf. Suppose 
                    that you<br>
                    take all these hypotheses in turn, and see what are the consequences<br>
                    which follow from each of them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Very good, and first let us assume them to say that 
                    nothing<br>
                    is capable of participating in anything else in any respect; 
                    in that<br>
                    case rest and motion cannot participate in being at all.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. They cannot.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But would either of them be if not participating in 
                    being?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. No.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then by this admission everything is instantly overturned, 
                    as<br>
                    well the doctrine of universal motion as of universal rest, 
                    and also<br>
                    the doctrine of those who distribute being into immutable 
                    and<br>
                    everlasting kinds; for all these add on a notion of being, 
                    some<br>
                    affirming that things &quot;are&quot; truly in motion, and 
                    others that they<br>
                    &quot;are&quot; truly at rest.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaes. Just so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Again, those who would at one time compound, and at 
                    another<br>
                    resolve all things, whether making them into one and out of 
                    one<br>
                    creating infinity, or dividing them into finite clements, 
                    and<br>
                    forming compounds out of these; whether they suppose the processes 
                    of creation to be successive or continuous, would be talking 
                    nonsense in all this if there were no admixture.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Most ridiculous of all will the men themselves be who 
                    want to<br>
                    carry out the argument and yet forbid us to call anything, 
                    because<br>
                    participating in some affection from another, by the name 
                    of that<br>
                    other.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Why so?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Why, because they are compelled to use the words &quot;to 
                    be,&quot;<br>
                    &quot;apart,&quot; &quot;from others. &quot;in itself,&quot; 
                    and ten thousand more, which<br>
                    they cannot give up, but must make the connecting links of<br>
                    discourse; and therefore they do not require to be refuted 
                    by<br>
                    others, but their enemy, as the saying is, inhabits the same 
                    house<br>
                    with them; they are always carrying about with them an <br>
                    adversary, like the wonderful ventriloquist, Eurycles, who 
                    out of their own bellies audibly contradicts them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Precisely so; a very true and exact illustration.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And now, if we suppose that all things have the power 
                    of<br>
                    communion with one another -what will follow?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Even I can solve that riddle.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. How?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Why, because motion itself would be at rest, and 
                    rest<br>
                    again in motion, if they could be attributed to one another.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But this is utterly impossible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Of course.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then only the third hypothesis remains.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. For, surely, either all things have communion with all; 
                    or<br>
                    nothing with any other thing; or some things communicate with 
                    some<br>
                    things and others not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And two out of these three suppositions have been found 
                    to be<br>
                    impossible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Every one then, who desires to answer truly, will adopt 
                    the<br>
                    third and remaining hypothesis of the communion of some with 
                    some.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. This communion of some with some may be illustrated 
                    <br>
                    by the caseof letters; for some letters do not fit each other, 
                    while others do.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Of course.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the vowels, especially, are a sort of bond which 
                    pervades<br>
                    all the other letters, so that without a vowel one consonant 
                    <br>
                    cannot be joined to another.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But does every one know what letters will unite with 
                    what? Or<br>
                    is art required in order to do so?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What is required.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. What art?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. The art of grammar.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And is not this also true of sounds high and low?-Is 
                    <br>
                    not he who has the art to know what sounds mingle, a musician, 
                    and he who is ignorant, not a musician?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And we shall find this to be generally true of art or 
                    the<br>
                    absence of art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Of course.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And as classes are admitted by us in like manner to 
                    be some<br>
                    of them capable and others incapable of intermixture, must 
                    not he<br>
                    who would rightly show what kinds will unite and what will 
                    not,<br>
                    proceed by the help of science in the path of argument? And 
                    will he<br>
                    not ask if the connecting links are universal, and so capable 
                    of<br>
                    intermixture with all things; and again, in divisions, whether 
                    there<br>
                    are not other universal classes, which make them possible?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. To be sure he will require science, and, if I am 
                    not<br>
                    mistaken, the very greatest of all sciences.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. How are we to call it? By Zeus, have we not lighted 
                    <br>
                    unwittingly upon our free and noble science, and in looking 
                    for the Sophist have we not entertained the philosopher unawares?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Should we not say that the division according to <br>
                    classes, which neither makes the same other, nor makes other 
                    the same, is the business of the dialectical science?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That is what we should say.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then, surely, he who can divide rightly is able to see<br>
                    clearly one form pervading a scattered multitude, and many 
                    different<br>
                    forms contained under one higher form; and again, one form 
                    knit<br>
                    together into a single whole and pervading many such wholes, 
                    and<br>
                    many forms, existing only in separation and isolation. This 
                    is the<br>
                    knowledge of classes which determines where they can have 
                    communion with one another and where not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the art of dialectic would be attributed by you 
                    <br>
                    only to the philosopher pure and true?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Who but he can be worthy?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. In this region we shall always discover the philosopher, 
                    if<br>
                    we look for him; like the Sophist, he is not easily discovered, 
                    but<br>
                    for a different reason.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. For what reason?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Because the Sophist runs away into the darkness of not-being,<br>
                    in which he has learned by habit to feel about, and cannot 
                    be<br>
                    discovered because of the darkness of the place. is not that 
                    true?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. It seems to be so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the philosopher, always holding converse through 
                    reason<br>
                    with the idea of being, is also dark from excess of light; 
                    for the<br>
                    souls of the many have no eye which can endure the vision 
                    of the<br>
                    divine.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes; that seems to be quite as true as the other.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Well, the philosopher may hereafter be more fully <br>
                    considered by us, if we are disposed; but the Sophist must 
                    clearly not be allowed to escape until we have had a good 
                    look at him.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Since, then, we are agreed that some classes have a 
                    communion<br>
                    with one another, and others not, and some have communion 
                    with a few and others with many, and that there is no reason 
                    why some should not have universal communion with all, let 
                    us now pursue the<br>
                    enquiry, as the argument suggests, not in relation to all 
                    ideas,<br>
                    lest the multitude of them should confuse us, but let us select 
                    a<br>
                    few of those which are reckoned to be the principal ones, 
                    <br>
                    and consider their several natures and their capacity of communion 
                    with one another, in order that if we are not able to apprehend 
                    with perfect clearness the notions of being and not-being, 
                    we may at <br>
                    least not fall short in the consideration of them, so far 
                    as they come within the scope of the present enquiry, if peradventure 
                    we may be allowed to assert the reality of not-being, and 
                    yet escape unscathed.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. We must do so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The most important of all the genera are those which 
                    we were<br>
                    just now mentioning-being and rest and motion.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, by far.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And two of these are, as we affirm, incapable of <br>
                    communion with one another.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite incapable.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Whereas being surely has communion with both of them, 
                    for<br>
                    both of them are?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Of course.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. That makes up three of them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. To be sure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And each of them is other than the remaining two, but 
                    the<br>
                    same with itself.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But then, what is the meaning of these two words, &quot;same&quot; 
                    and<br>
                    &quot;other&quot;? Are they two new kinds other than the three, 
                    and yet always<br>
                    of necessity intermingling with them, and are we to have five 
                    kinds<br>
                    instead of three; or when we speak of the same and other, 
                    are we<br>
                    unconsciously speaking of one of the three first kinds?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very likely we are.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But, surely, motion and rest are neither the other nor 
                    the<br>
                    same.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How is that?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Whatever we attribute to motion and rest in common, 
                    cannot be<br>
                    either of them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Why not?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Because motion would be at rest and rest in motion, 
                    for<br>
                    either of them, being predicated of both, will compel the 
                    other to<br>
                    change into the opposite of its own nature, because partaking 
                    of its<br>
                    opposite.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yet they surely both partake of the same and of the 
                    other?<br>
                    Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then we must not assert that motion, any more than rest, 
                    is<br>
                    either the same or the other.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. No; we must not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But are we to conceive that being and the same are identical?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Possibly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But if they are identical, then again in saying that 
                    <br>
                    motion and rest have being, we should also be saying that 
                    they are the same.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Which surely cannot be.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then being and same cannot be one.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Scarcely.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then we may suppose the same to be a fourth class, <br>
                    which is now to be added to the three others.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And shall we call the other a fifth class? Or should 
                    we<br>
                    consider being and other to be two names of the same class?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very likely.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But you would agree, if I am not mistaken, that existences<br>
                    are relative as well as absolute?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the other is always relative to other?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But this would not be the case unless being and the 
                    other<br>
                    entirely differed; for, if the other, like being, were absolute 
                    as<br>
                    well as relative, then there would have been a kind of other 
                    <br>
                    which was not other than other. And now we find that what 
                    is other must of necessity be what it is in relation to some 
                    other.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That is the true state of the case.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then we must admit the other as the fifth of our selected<br>
                    classes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the fifth class pervades all classes, for they all 
                    differ<br>
                    from one another, not by reason of their own nature, but because<br>
                    they partake of the idea of the other.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then let us now put the case with reference to each 
                    of the<br>
                    five.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. First there is motion, which we affirm to be <br>
                    absolutely &quot;other&quot;than rest: what else can we say?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. It is so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And therefore is not rest.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And yet is, because partaking of being.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Again, motion is other than the same?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Just so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And is therefore not the same.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. It is not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yet, surely, motion is the same, because all things 
                    partake<br>
                    of the same.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then we must admit, and not object to say, that motion 
                    is the<br>
                    same and is not the same, for we do not apply the terms &quot;same&quot; 
                    and<br>
                    &quot;not the same,&quot; in the same sense; but we call it 
                    the &quot;same,&quot; in<br>
                    relation to itself, because partaking of the same; and not 
                    the same,<br>
                    because having communion with the other, it is thereby severed 
                    from<br>
                    the same, and has become not that but other, and is therefore<br>
                    rightly spoken of as &quot;not the same.&quot;<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. To be sure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And if absolute motion in any point of view partook 
                    of rest,<br>
                    there would be no absurdity in calling motion stationary.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite right, -that is, on the supposition that some<br>
                    classes mingle with one another, and others not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. That such a communion of kinds is according to nature, 
                    we had<br>
                    already proved before we arrived at this part of our discussion.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us proceed, then. we not say that motion is other 
                    than<br>
                    the other, having been also proved by us to be other than 
                    <br>
                    the same and other than rest?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That is certain.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then, according to this view, motion is other and also 
                    not<br>
                    other?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. What is the next step? Shall we say that motion is other 
                    than<br>
                    the three and not other than the fourth-for we agreed that 
                    there are<br>
                    five classes about and in the sphere of which we proposed 
                    to make<br>
                    enquiry?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Surely we cannot admit that the number is less than 
                    it<br>
                    appeared to be just now.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then we may without fear contend that motion is other 
                    than<br>
                    being?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Without the least fear.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The plain result is that motion, since it partakes of 
                    being,<br>
                    really is and also is not?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Nothing can be plainer.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then not-being necessarily exists in the case of motion 
                    and<br>
                    of every class; for the nature of the other entering into 
                    them all,<br>
                    makes each of them other than being, and so non-existent; 
                    and<br>
                    therefore of all of them, in like manner, we may truly say 
                    that they<br>
                    are not-and again, inasmuch as they partake of being, that 
                    they are<br>
                    and are existent.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. So we may assume.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Every class, then, has plurality of being and infinity 
                    of<br>
                    not-being.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. So we must infer.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And being itself may be said to be other than the other 
                    kinds.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then we may infer that being is not, in respect of as 
                    many<br>
                    other things as there are; for not-being these it is itself 
                    one, and<br>
                    is: not the other things, which are infinite in number.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That is not far from the truth.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And we must not quarrel with this result, since it is 
                    of the<br>
                    nature of classes to have communion with one another; and 
                    if any one<br>
                    denies our present statement [viz., that being is not, etc.], 
                    let<br>
                    him first argue with our former conclusion [i.e., respecting 
                    the<br>
                    communion of ideas], and then he may proceed to argue with 
                    what<br>
                    follows.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Nothing can be fairer.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let me ask you to consider a further question.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What question?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. When we speak of not-being, we speak, I suppose, not 
                    of<br>
                    something opposed to being, but only different.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. When we speak of something as not great, does the expression<br>
                    seem to you to imply what is little any more than what is 
                    equal?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The negative particles, ou and me, when prefixed to 
                    words, do<br>
                    not imply opposition, but only difference from the words, 
                    or more<br>
                    correctly from the things represented by the words, which 
                    <br>
                    follow them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is another point to be considered, if you do not 
                    object.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What is it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The nature of the other appears to me to be divided 
                    into<br>
                    fractions like knowledge.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How so?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Knowledge, like the other, is one; and yet the <br>
                    various parts of knowledge have each of them their own particular 
                    name, and hence there are many arts and kinds of knowledge.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And is not the case the same with the parts of the <br>
                    other, which is also one?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very likely; but will you tell me how?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is some part of the other which is opposed to 
                    the<br>
                    beautiful?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. There is.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Shall we say that this has or has not a name?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. It has; for whatever we call not beautiful is <br>
                    other than the beautiful, not than something else.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And now tell me another thing.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Is the not-beautiful anything but this-an existence 
                    parted<br>
                    off from a certain kind of existence, and again from another 
                    point<br>
                    of view opposed to an existing something?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then the not-beautiful turns out to be the opposition 
                    of<br>
                    being to being?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But upon this view, is the beautiful a more real and 
                    the<br>
                    not-beautiful a less real existence?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Not at all.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the not-great may be said to exist, equally with 
                    <br>
                    the great?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And, in the same way, the just must be placed in the 
                    same<br>
                    category with the not-just the one cannot be said to have 
                    any more<br>
                    existence than the other.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The same may be said of other things; seeing that the 
                    <br>
                    nature of the other has a real existence, the parts of this 
                    nature must<br>
                    equally be supposed to exist.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Of course.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then, as would appear, the opposition of a part of the 
                    other,<br>
                    and of a part of being, to one another, is, if I may venture 
                    to say<br>
                    so, as truly essence as being itself, and implies not the 
                    opposite<br>
                    of being, but only what is other than being.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Beyond question.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. What then shall we call it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Clearly, not-being; and this is the very nature for 
                    which<br>
                    the Sophist compelled us to search.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And has not this, as you were saying, as real an existence 
                    as<br>
                    any other class? May I not say with confidence that not-being 
                    has an<br>
                    assured existence, and a nature of its own? just as the great 
                    was<br>
                    found to be great and the beautiful beautiful, and the not-great<br>
                    not-great, and the not-beautiful not-beautiful, in the same 
                    manner<br>
                    not-being has been found to be and is not-being, and is to 
                    <br>
                    be reckoned one among the many classes of being. Do you, Theaetetus, 
                    still feel any doubt of this?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. None whatever.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Do you observe that our scepticism has carried us beyond 
                    the<br>
                    range of Parmenides' prohibition?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. In what?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. We have advanced to a further point, and shown him <br>
                    more than he for bad us to investigate.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How is that?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Why, because he says-Not-being never is, and do thou 
                    keep thy thoughts from this way of enquiry.</p>
                  <p> Theaet. Yes, he says so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Whereas, we have not only proved that things which <br>
                    are not are, but we have shown what form of being not-being 
                    is; for we have shown that the nature of the other is, and 
                    is distributed over all things in their relations to one another, 
                    and whatever part of the other is contrasted with being, this 
                    is precisely what we have <br>
                    ventured to call not-being.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. And surely, Stranger, we were quite right.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let not any one say, then, that while affirming the<br>
                    opposition of not-being to being, we still assert the being 
                    of<br>
                    not-being; for as to whether there is an opposite of being, 
                    to that<br>
                    enquiry we have long said good-bye-it may or may not be, and 
                    may or may not be capable of definition. But as touching our 
                    present<br>
                    account of not-being, let a man either convince us of error, 
                    or, so<br>
                    long as he cannot, he too must say, as we are saying, that 
                    there is<br>
                    a communion of classes, and that being, and difference or 
                    other,<br>
                    traverse all things and mutually interpenetrate, so that the 
                    other<br>
                    partakes of being, and by reason of this participation is, 
                    and yet<br>
                    is not that of which it partakes, but other, and being other 
                    than<br>
                    being, it is clearly a necessity that not-being should be. 
                    again,<br>
                    being, through partaking of the other, becomes a class other 
                    than<br>
                    the remaining classes, and being other than all of them, is 
                    not each<br>
                    one of them, and is not all the rest, so that undoubtedly 
                    there are<br>
                    thousands upon thousands of cases in which being is not, and 
                    <br>
                    all other things, whether regarded individually or collectively, 
                    in many<br>
                    respects are, and in many respects are not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And he who is sceptical of this contradiction, must 
                    think how<br>
                    he can find something better to say; or if. he sees a puzzle, 
                    and<br>
                    his pleasure is to drag words this way and that, the argument 
                    will<br>
                    prove to him, that he is not making a worthy use of his <br>
                    faculties; for there is no charm in such puzzles, and there 
                    is no difficulty in detecting them; but we can tell him of 
                    something else the pursuit of which is noble and also difficult.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What is it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. A thing of which I have already spoken;-letting alone 
                    these<br>
                    puzzles as involving no difficulty, he should be able to follow, 
                    and<br>
                    criticize in detail every argument, and when a man says that 
                    the<br>
                    same is in a manner other, or that other is the same, to understand<br>
                    and refute him from his own point of view, and in the same 
                    respect<br>
                    in which he asserts either of these affections. But to show 
                    that<br>
                    somehow and in some sense the same is other, or the other 
                    <br>
                    same, or the great small, or the like unlike; and to delight 
                    in always bringing forward such contradictions, is no real 
                    refutation, but is <br>
                    clearly the new-born babe of some one who is only beginning 
                    to approach the problem of being.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. To be sure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. For certainly, my friend, the attempt to separate all<br>
                    existences from one another is a barbarism and utterly unworthy 
                    of<br>
                    an educated or philosophical mind.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Why so?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The attempt at universal separation is the final annihilation<br>
                    of all reasoning; for only by the union of conceptions with 
                    one<br>
                    another do we attain to discourse of reason.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And, observe that we were only just in time in making 
                    a<br>
                    resistance to such separatists, and compelling them to admit 
                    that<br>
                    one thing mingles with another.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Why so?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Why, that we might be able to assert discourse to be 
                    a kind<br>
                    of being; for if we could not, the worst of all consequences 
                    would<br>
                    follow; we should have no philosophy. Moreover, the necessity 
                    for<br>
                    determining the nature of discourse presses upon us at this 
                    <br>
                    moment; if utterly deprived of it, we could no more hold discourse; 
                    and deprived of it we should be if we admitted that there 
                    was no <br>
                    admixture of natures at all.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very true. But I do not understand why at this moment 
                    we<br>
                    must determine the nature of discourse.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Perhaps you will see more clearly by the help of the<br>
                    following explanation.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What explanation?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Not-being has been acknowledged by us to be one among 
                    many<br>
                    classes diffused over all being.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And thence arises the question, whether not-being mingles<br>
                    with opinion and language.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How so?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. If not-being has no part in the proposition, then all 
                    things<br>
                    must be true; but if not-being has a part, then false opinion 
                    and<br>
                    false speech are possible, for. think or to say what is not-is<br>
                    falsehood, which thus arises in the region of thought and 
                    in speech.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That is quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And where there is falsehood surely there must be deceit.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And if there is deceit, then all things must be full 
                    of idols<br>
                    and images and fancies.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. To be sure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Into that region the Sophist, as we said, made his <br>
                    escape, and, when he had got there, denied the very possibility 
                    of falsehood; no one, he argued, either conceived or uttered 
                    falsehood, inasmuch as not-being did not in any way partake 
                    of being.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And now, not-being has been shown to partake of being, 
                    and<br>
                    therefore he will not continue fighting in this direction, 
                    <br>
                    but he will probably say that some ideas partake of not-being, 
                    and some not, and that language and opinion are of the non-partaking 
                    class; and he will still fight to the death against the existence 
                    of the<br>
                    image-making and phantastic art, in which we have placed <br>
                    him, because,as he will say, opinion and language do not partake 
                    of not-being, and unless this participation exists, there 
                    can be no such thing as falsehood. And, with the view of meeting 
                    this evasion, we must begin by enquiring into the nature of 
                    language, opinion, and <br>
                    imagination, in order that when we find them we may find also 
                    that they have communion with not-being, and, having made 
                    out the connection of them, may thus prove that falsehood 
                    exists; and therein we will imprison the Sophist, if he deserves 
                    it, or, if not, we will let him go again and look for him 
                    in another class.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly, Stranger, there appears to be truth in 
                    what was<br>
                    said about the Sophist at first, that he was of a class not 
                    easily<br>
                    caught, for he seems to have abundance of defences, which 
                    he throws up, and which must every one of them be stormed 
                    before we can reach the man himself. And even now, we have 
                    with difficulty got <br>
                    through his first defence, which is the not-being of not-being, 
                    and lo! here is another; for we have still to show that falsehood 
                    exists in <br>
                    the sphere of language and opinion, and there will be another 
                    and <br>
                    another line of defence without end.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Any one, Theaetetus, who is able to advance even a <br>
                    little ought to be of good cheer, for what would he who is 
                    dispirited at a little progress do, if he were making none 
                    at all, or even undergoing a repulse? Such a faint heart, 
                    as the proverb says, will never take a city: but now that 
                    we have succeeded thus far, the citadel is ours, and what 
                    remains is easier.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then, as I was saying, let us first of all obtain a<br>
                    conception of language and opinion, in order that we may have<br>
                    clearer grounds for determining, whether not-being has any 
                    concern<br>
                    with them, or whether they are both always true, and neither 
                    of them<br>
                    ever false.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then, now, let us speak of names, as before we were 
                    <br>
                    speaking of ideas and letters; for that is the direction in 
                    which the answer may be expected.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. And what is the question at issue about names?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The question at issue is whether all names may be connected<br>
                    with one another, or none, or only some of them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Clearly the last is true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I understand you to say that words which have a <br>
                    meaning when in sequence may be connected, but that words 
                    which have no meaning when in sequence cannot be connected?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What are you saying?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. What I thought that you intended when you gave your 
                    <br>
                    assent; for there are two sorts of intimation of being which 
                    are given by the voice.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What are they?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. One of them is called nouns, and the other verbs.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Describe them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. That which denotes action we call a verb.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the other, which is an articulate mark set on those 
                    who<br>
                    do the actions, we call a noun.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. A succession of nouns only is not a sentence any more 
                    than of<br>
                    verbs without nouns.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I do not understand you.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I see that when you gave your assent you had something 
                    else<br>
                    in your mind. But what I intended to say was, that a mere 
                    succession<br>
                    of nouns or of verbs is not discourse.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I mean that words like &quot;walks,&quot; &quot;runs,&quot; 
                    &quot;sleeps,&quot; or any<br>
                    other words which denote action, however many of them you 
                    string<br>
                    together, do not make discourse.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How can they?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Or, again, when you say &quot;lion,&quot; &quot;stag,&quot; 
                    &quot;horse,&quot; or any other<br>
                    words which denote agents -neither in this way of stringing 
                    words<br>
                    together do you attain to discourse; for there is no expression 
                    of<br>
                    action or inaction, or of the existence of existence or<br>
                    non-existence indicated by the sounds, until verbs are mingled 
                    with<br>
                    nouns; then the words fit, and the smallest combination of 
                    them<br>
                    forms language, and is the simplest and least form of discourse.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Again I ask, What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. When any one says &quot;A man learns,&quot; should you 
                    not call this<br>
                    the simplest and least of sentences?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes, for he now arrives at the point of giving an intimation<br>
                    about something which is, or is becoming, or has become, or 
                    will be.<br>
                    And he not only names, but he does something, by connecting 
                    <br>
                    verbs with nouns; and therefore we say that he discourses, 
                    and to this <br>
                    connection of words we give the name of discourse.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And as there are some things which fit one another, 
                    and other<br>
                    things which do not fit, so there are some vocal signs which 
                    do, and<br>
                    others which do not, combine and form discourse.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is another small matter.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What is it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. A sentence must and cannot help having a subject.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And must be of a certain quality.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And now let us mind what we are about.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. We must do so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I will repeat a sentence to you in which a thing and 
                    an<br>
                    action are combined, by the help of a noun and a verb; and 
                    you shall<br>
                    tell me of whom the sentence speaks.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I will, to the best my power.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. &quot;Theaetetus sits&quot;-not a very long sentence.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Not very.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Of whom does the sentence speak, and who is the <br>
                    subject that is what you have to tell.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Of me; I am the subject.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Or this sentence, again-<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What sentence?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. &quot;Theaetetus, with whom I am now speaking, is flying.&quot;<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That also is a sentence which will be admitted by 
                    every<br>
                    one to speak of me, and to apply to me.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. We agreed that every sentence must necessarily have 
                    a certain<br>
                    quality.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And what is the quality of each of these two sentences?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. The one, as I imagine, is false, and the other true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The true says what is true about you?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the false says what is other than true?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And therefore speaks of things which are not as if they 
                    were?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And say that things are real of you which are not; for, 
                    as we<br>
                    were saying, in regard to each thing or person, there is much 
                    that<br>
                    is and much that is not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The second of the two sentences which related to you 
                    was<br>
                    first of all an example of the shortest form consistent with 
                    our<br>
                    definition.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, this was implied in recent admission.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And, in the second place, it related to a subject?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Who must be you, and can be nobody else?<br>
                    Theaet. Unquestionably.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And it would be no sentence at all if there were no 
                    subject,<br>
                    for, as we proved, a sentence which has no subject is impossible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. When other, then, is asserted of you as the same, and 
                    <br>
                    not-being as being, such a combination of nouns and verbs 
                    is really and truly false discourse.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Most true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And therefore thought, opinion, and imagination are 
                    now<br>
                    proved to exist in our minds both as true and false.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How so?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You will know better if you first gain a knowledge of 
                    <br>
                    what they are, and in what they severally differ from one 
                    another.<br>
                    Theaet. Give me the knowledge which you would wish me to gain.<br>
                    Str. Are not thought and speech the same, with this exception,<br>
                    that what is called thought is the unuttered conversation 
                    of the<br>
                    soul with herself?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But the stream of thought which flows through the lips 
                    and is<br>
                    audible is called speech?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And we know that there exists in speech...<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What exists?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Affirmation.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, we know it.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. When the affirmation or denial takes Place in silence 
                    and in<br>
                    the mind only, have you any other name by which to call it 
                    but<br>
                    opinion?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. There can be no other name.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And when opinion is presented, not simply, but in some 
                    form<br>
                    of sense, would you not call it imagination?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And seeing that language is true and false, and that 
                    <br>
                    thought is the conversation of the soul with herself, and 
                    opinion is the end of thinking, and imagination or phantasy 
                    is the union of sense and<br>
                    opinion, the inference is that some of them, since they are 
                    akin to<br>
                    language, should have an element of falsehood as well as of 
                    truth?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Do you perceive, then, that false opinion and speech 
                    have<br>
                    been discovered sooner than we expected?-For just now we seemed 
                    to be undertaking a task which would never be accomplished.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I perceive.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then let us not be discouraged about the future; but 
                    <br>
                    now having made this discovery, let us go back to our previous 
                    classification.</p>
                  <p> Theaet. What classification?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. We divided image-making into two sorts; the one<br>
                    likeness-making, the other imaginative or phantastic.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And we said that we were uncertain in which we should 
                    <br>
                    place the Sophist.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. We did say so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And our heads began to go round more and more when it 
                    was<br>
                    asserted that there is no such thing as an image or idol or<br>
                    appearance, because in no manner or time or place can there 
                    ever be<br>
                    such a thing as falsehood.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And now, since there has been shown to be false speech 
                    and<br>
                    false opinion, there may be imitations of real existences, 
                    and out<br>
                    of this condition of the mind an art of deception may arise.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite possible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And we have: already admitted, in what preceded, that 
                    the<br>
                    Sophist was lurking in one of the divisions of the likeness-making<br>
                    art?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us, then, renew the attempt, and in dividing any 
                    class,<br>
                    always take the part to the right, holding fast to that which 
                    holds<br>
                    the Sophist, until we have stripped him of all his common<br>
                    properties, and reached his difference or peculiar. Then we 
                    may<br>
                    exhibit him in his true nature, first to ourselves and then 
                    <br>
                    to kindred dialectical spirits.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You may remember that all art was originally divided 
                    <br>
                    by us into creative and acquisitive.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
                  <p> Str. And the Sophist was flitting before us in the acquisitiveclass, 
                    in the subdivisions of hunting, contests, merchandise, and 
                    the like.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But now that the imitative art has enclosed him, it 
                    is clear<br>
                    that we must begin by dividing the art of creation; for <br>
                    imitation is a kind of creation of images, however, as we 
                    affirm, and not of real things.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. In the first place, there are two kinds of creation.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What are they?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. One of them is human and the other divine.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I do not follow.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Every power, as you may remember our saying originally, 
                    which<br>
                    causes things to exist, not previously existing, was defined 
                    by us<br>
                    as creative.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I remember.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Looking, now, at the world and all the animals and plants, 
                    at<br>
                    things which grow upon the earth from seeds and roots, as 
                    well as at<br>
                    inanimate substances which are formed within the earth, fusile 
                    or<br>
                    non-fusile, shall we say that they come into existence-not 
                    having<br>
                    existed previously-by the creation of God, or shall we agree 
                    with<br>
                    vulgar opinion about them?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What is it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The opinion that nature brings them into being from 
                    some<br>
                    spontaneous and unintelligent cause. Or shall we say that 
                    they are<br>
                    created by a divine reason and a knowledge which comes from 
                    God?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I dare say that, owing to my youth, I may often waver 
                    in<br>
                    my view, but now when I look at you and see that you incline 
                    to<br>
                    refer them to God, I defer to your authority.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Nobly said, Theaetetus, and if I thought that you were 
                    one of<br>
                    those who would hereafter change your mind, I would have <br>
                    gently argued with you, and forced you to assent; but as I 
                    perceive that you will come of yourself and without any argument 
                    of mine, to that belief which, as you say, attracts you, I 
                    will not forestall the work of time. Let me suppose then, 
                    that things which are said to be made by nature are the work 
                    of divine art, and that things which are made by man out of 
                    these are work of human art. And so there are two kinds of 
                    making and production, the one human and the other divine.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then, now, subdivide each of the two sections which 
                    we have<br>
                    already.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I mean to say that you should make a vertical division 
                    of<br>
                    production or invention, as you have already made a lateral 
                    one.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I have done so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then, now, there are in all four parts or segments-two 
                    of<br>
                    them have reference to us and are human, and two of them have<br>
                    reference to the gods and are divine.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And, again, in the division which was supposed to be 
                    made in<br>
                    the other way, one part in each subdivision is the making 
                    of the<br>
                    things themselves, but the two remaining parts may be called 
                    the<br>
                    making of likenesses; and so the productive art is again divided<br>
                    into two parts.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Tell me the divisions once more.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I suppose that we, and the other animals, and the elements<br>
                    out of which things are made-fire, water, and the like-are 
                    <br>
                    known by us to be each and all the creation and work of God.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And there are images of them, which are not them, but 
                    which<br>
                    correspond to them; and these are also the creation of a wonderful<br>
                    skill.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What are they?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The appearances which spring up of themselves in sleep 
                    or by<br>
                    day, such as a shadow when darkness arises in a fire, or the<br>
                    reflection which is produced when the light in bright and 
                    smooth<br>
                    objects meets on their surface with an external light, and 
                    creates a<br>
                    perception the opposite of our ordinary sight.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes; and the images as well as the creation are equally<br>
                    the work of a divine hand.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And what shall we say of human art? Do we not make <br>
                    one house by the art of building, and another by the art of 
                    drawing, which is a sort of dream created by man for those 
                    who are awake?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And other products of human creation are twofold and 
                    go in<br>
                    pairs; there is the thing, with which the art of making the 
                    thing is<br>
                    concerned, and the image, with which imitation is concerned.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Now I begin to understand, and am ready to acknowledge<br>
                    that there are two kinds of production, and each of them two 
                    fold;<br>
                    in the lateral division there is both a divine and a human 
                    <br>
                    production; in the vertical there are realities and a creation 
                    of a kind of<br>
                    similitudes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And let us not forget that of the imitative class the 
                    one<br>
                    part to have been likeness making, and the other phantastic, 
                    if it<br>
                    could be shown that falsehood is a reality and belongs to 
                    <br>
                    the class of real being.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And this appeared to be the case; and therefore now, 
                    without<br>
                    hesitation, we shall number the different kinds as two.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then, now, let us again divide the phantastic art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Where shall we make the division?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is one kind which is produced by an instrument, 
                    and<br>
                    another in which the creator of the appearance is himself 
                    the<br>
                    instrument.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. When any one makes himself appear like another in his 
                    <br>
                    figure or his voice, imitation is the name for this part of 
                    the phantastic art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let this, then, be named the art of mimicry, and this 
                    the<br>
                    province assigned to it; as for the other division, we are 
                    weary and<br>
                    will give that up, leaving to some one else the duty of making 
                    the<br>
                    class and giving it a suitable name.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Let us do as you say-assign a sphere to the one and 
                    leave<br>
                    the other.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is a further distinction, Theaetetus, which is 
                    worthy<br>
                    of our consideration, and for a reason which I will tell you.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Let me hear.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There are some who imitate, knowing what they <br>
                    imitate, and some who do not know. And what line of distinction 
                    can there possibly be greater than that which divides ignorance 
                    from knowledge?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. There can be no greater.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Was not the sort of imitation of which we spoke just 
                    now the<br>
                    imitation of those who know? For he who would imitate you 
                    <br>
                    would surely know you and your figure?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Naturally.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And what would you say of the figure or form of justice 
                    or of<br>
                    virtue in general? Are we not well aware that many, having 
                    no<br>
                    knowledge of either, but only a sort of opinion, do their 
                    <br>
                    best to show that this opinion is really entertained by them, 
                    by expressing it, as far as they can, in word and deed?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, that is very common.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And do they always fail in their attempt to be thought 
                    just,<br>
                    when they are not? Or is not the very opposite true?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. The very opposite.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Such a one, then, should be described as an imitator-to 
                    be<br>
                    distinguished from the other, as he who is ignorant is distinguished<br>
                    from him who knows?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Can we find a suitable name for each of them? This is 
                    clearly<br>
                    not an easy task; for among the ancients there was some confusion 
                    of<br>
                    ideas, which prevented them from attempting to divide genera 
                    into<br>
                    species; wherefore there is no great abundance of names. Yet, 
                    for<br>
                    the sake of distinctness, I will make bold to call the imitation 
                    which coexists with opinion, the imitation of appearance-that 
                    which coexists with science, a scientific or learned imitation.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Granted.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The former is our present concern, for the Sophist was<br>
                    classed with imitators indeed, but not among those who have 
                    <br>
                    knowledge.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us, then, examine our imitator of appearance, and 
                    see<br>
                    whether he is sound, like a piece of iron, or whether there 
                    is still<br>
                    some crack in him.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Let us examine him.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Indeed there is a very considerable crack; for if you 
                    <br>
                    look, you find that one of the two classes of imitators is 
                    a simple creature, who thinks that he knows that which he 
                    only fancies; the other sort has knocked about among arguments, 
                    until he suspects and <br>
                    fears that he is ignorant of that which to the many he pretends 
                    to know.</p>
                  <p> Theaet. There are certainly the two kinds which you describe.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Shall we regard one as the simple imitator-the other 
                    as the<br>
                    dissembling or ironical imitator?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And shall we further speak of this latter class as having 
                    one<br>
                    or two divisions?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Answer yourself.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Upon consideration, then, there appear to me to be two; 
                    there<br>
                    is the dissembler, who harangues a multitude in public in 
                    a long<br>
                    speech, and the dissembler, who in private and in short speeches<br>
                    compels the person who is conversing with him to contradict 
                    himself.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What you say is most true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And who is the maker of the longer speeches? Is he the<br>
                    statesman or the popular orator?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. The latter.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And what shall we call the other? Is he the philosopher 
                    or<br>
                    the Sophist?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. The philosopher he cannot be, for upon our view he 
                    is<br>
                    ignorant; but since he is an imitator of the wise he will 
                    have a<br>
                    name which is formed by an adaptation of the word sothos. 
                    What shall we name him? I am pretty sure that I cannot be 
                    mistaken in <br>
                    terming him the true and very Sophist.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Shall we bind up his name as we did before, making a 
                    <br>
                    chain from one end of his genealogy to the other?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. By all means.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. He, then, who traces the pedigree of his art as follows-who,<br>
                    belonging to the conscious or dissembling section of the art 
                    of<br>
                    causing self-contradiction, is an imitator of appearance, 
                    and is<br>
                    separated from the class of phantastic which is a branch of<br>
                    image-making into that further division of creation, the juggling 
                    of<br>
                    words, a creation human, and not divine-any one who affirms 
                    the real<br>
                    Sophist to be of this blood and lineage will say the very 
                    truth.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Undoubtedly.</p>

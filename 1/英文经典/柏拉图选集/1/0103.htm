                    Athenian Stranger. Enough of this. And what, then, is to be 
                    regardedas the origin of government? Will not a man be able 
                    to judge of itbest from a point of view in which he may behold 
                    the progress ofstates and their transitions to good or evil?</p>
                  <p>Cleinias. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I mean that he might watch them from the point of view 
                    of time,and observe the changes which take place in them during 
                    infinite ages.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How so?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Why, do you think that you can reckon the time which 
                    haselapsed since cities first existed and men were citizens 
                    of them?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Hardly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But are sure that it must be vast and incalculable?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And have not thousands and thousands of cities come 
                    intobeing during this period and as many perished? And has 
                    not each ofthem had every form of government many times over, 
                    now growing larger,now smaller, and again improving or declining?</p>
                  <p>Cle. To be sure.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us endeavour to ascertain the cause of these changes; 
                    forthat will probably explain the first origin and development 
                    of formsof government.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good. You shall endeavour to impart your thoughts 
                    to us,and we will make an effort to understand you.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Do you believe that there is any truth in ancient traditions?</p>
                  <p>Cle. What traditions?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The traditions about the many destructions of mankind 
                    whichhave been occasioned by deluges and pestilences, and 
                    in many otherways, and of the survival of a remnant?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Every one is disposed to believe them.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us consider one of them, that which was caused by 
                    thefamous deluge.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What are we to observe about it?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I mean to say that those who then escaped would only 
                    be hillshepherds-small sparks of the human race preserved 
                    on the tops ofmountains.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Clearly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Such survivors would necessarily be unacquainted with 
                    thearts and the various devices which are suggested to the 
                    dwellers incities by interest or ambition, and with all the 
                    wrongs which theycontrive against one another.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us suppose, then, that the cities in the plain and 
                    on thesea-coast were utterly destroyed at that time.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Would not all implements have then perished and every 
                    otherexcellent invention of political or any other sort of 
                    wisdom haveutterly disappeared?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Why, yes, my friend; and if things had always continued 
                    as theyare at present ordered, how could any discovery have 
                    ever been madeeven in the least particular? For it is evident 
                    that the arts wereunknown during ten thousand times ten thousand 
                    years. And no more thana thousand or two thousand years have 
                    elapsed since the discoveries ofDaedalus, Orpheus and Palamedes-since 
                    Marsyas and Olympus inventedmusic, and Amphion the lyre-not 
                    to speak of numberless otherinventions which are but of yesterday.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Have you forgotten, Cleinias, the name of a friend who 
                    isreally of yesterday?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I suppose that you mean Epimenides.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The same, my friend; he does indeed far overleap the 
                    heads ofall mankind by his invention; for he carried out in 
                    practice, as youdeclare, what of old Hesiod only preached.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes, according to our tradition.</p>
                  <p>Ath. After the great destruction, may we not suppose that 
                    thestate of man was something of this sort:-In the beginning 
                    of thingsthere was a fearful illimitable desert and a vast 
                    expanse of land; aherd or two of oxen would be the only survivors 
                    of the animal world;and there might be a few goats, these 
                    too hardly enough to maintainthe shepherds who tended them?</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And of cities or governments or legislation, about which 
                    we arenow talking, do you suppose that they could have any 
                    recollection atall?</p>
                  <p>Cle. None whatever.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And out of this state of things has there not sprung 
                    all thatwe now are and have: cities and governments, and arts 
                    and laws, anda great deal of vice and a great deal of virtue?</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Why, my good friend, how can we possibly suppose that 
                    those whoknew nothing of all the good and evil of cities could 
                    have attainedtheir full development, whether of virtue or 
                    of vice?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I understand your meaning, and you are quite right.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But, as time advanced and the race multiplied, the world 
                    cameto be what the world is.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Doubtless the change was not made all in a moment, but 
                    littleby little, during a very long period of time.</p>
                  <p>Cle. A highly probable supposition.</p>
                  <p>Ath. At first, they would have a natural fear ringing in 
                    theirears which would prevent their descending from the heights 
                    into theplain.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Of course.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The fewness of the survivors at that time would have 
                    madethem all the more desirous of seeing one another; but 
                    then the meansof travelling either by land or sea had been 
                    almost entirely lost,as I may say, with the loss of the arts, 
                    and there was greatdifficulty in getting at one another; for 
                    iron and brass and allmetals were jumbled together and had 
                    disappeared in the chaos; nor wasthere any possibility of 
                    extracting ore from them; and they hadscarcely any means of 
                    felling timber. Even if you suppose that someimplements might 
                    have been preserved in the mountains, they mustquickly have 
                    worn out and vanished, and there would be no more of themuntil 
                    the art of metallurgy had again revived.</p>
                  <p>Cle. There could not have been.</p>
                  <p>Ath. In how many generations would this be attained?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Clearly, not for many generations.</p>
                  <p>Ath. During this period, and for some time afterwards, all 
                    thearts which require iron and brass and the like would disappear.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Faction and war would also have died out in those days, 
                    and formany reasons.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How would that be?</p>
                  <p>Ath. In the first place, the desolation of these primitive 
                    men wouldcreate in them a feeling of affection and good-will 
                    towards oneanother; and, secondly, they would have no occasion 
                    to quarrel abouttheir subsistence, for they would have pasture 
                    in abundance, exceptjust at first, and in some particular 
                    cases; and from theirpasture-land they would obtain the greater 
                    part of their food in aprimitive age, having plenty of milk 
                    and flesh; moreover they wouldprocure other food by the chase, 
                    not to be despised either in quantityor quality. They would 
                    also have abundance of clothing, and bedding,and dwellings, 
                    and utensils either capable of standing on the fireor not; 
                    for the plastic and weaving arts do not require any use ofiron: 
                    and God has given these two arts to man in order to providehim 
                    with all such things, that, when reduced to the last extremity,the 
                    human race may still grow and increase. Hence in those daysmankind 
                    were not very poor; nor was poverty a cause of differenceamong 
                    them; and rich they could not have been, having neither gold 
                    norsilver:-such at that time was their condition. And the 
                    community whichhas neither poverty nor riches will always 
                    have the noblestprinciples; in it there is no insolence or 
                    injustice, nor, again,are there any contentions or envyings. 
                    And therefore they were good,and also because they were what 
                    is called simple-minded; and when theywere told about good 
                    and evil, they in their simplicity believedwhat they heard 
                    to be very truth and practised it. No one had thewit to suspect 
                    another of a falsehood, as men do now; but what theyheard 
                    about Gods and men they believed to be true, and livedaccordingly; 
                    and therefore they were in all respects such as we havedescribed 
                    them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. That quite accords with my views, and with those of 
                    my friendhere.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Would not many generations living on in a simple manner,although 
                    ruder, perhaps, and more ignorant of the arts generally,and 
                    in particular of those of land or naval warfare, and likewise 
                    ofother arts, termed in cities legal practices and party conflicts,and 
                    including all conceivable ways of hurting one another in wordand 
                    deed;-although inferior to those who lived before the deluge, 
                    orto the men of our day in these respects, would they not, 
                    I say, besimpler and more manly, and also more temperate and 
                    altogether morejust? The reason has been already explained.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I should wish you to understand that what has preceded 
                    and whatis about to follow, has been, and will be said, with 
                    the intentionof explaining what need the men of that time 
                    had of laws, and whowas their lawgiver.</p>
                  <p>Cle. And thus far what you have said has been very well said.</p>
                  <p>Ath. They could hardly have wanted lawgivers as yet; nothing 
                    of thatsort was likely to have existed in their days, for 
                    they had no lettersat this early period; they lived by habit 
                    and the customs of theirancestors, as they are called.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Probably.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But there was already existing a form of government 
                    which, if Iam not mistaken, is generally termed a lordship, 
                    and this stillremains in many places, both among Hellenes 
                    and barbarians, and is thegovernment which is declared by 
                    Homer to have prevailed among theCyclopes:</p>
                  <p>They have neither councils nor judgments, but they dwell 
                    in hollowcaves on the tops of high mountains, and every one 
                    gives law to hiswife and children, and they do not busy themselves 
                    about one another.</p>
                  <p>Cle. That seems to be a charming poet of yours; I have read 
                    someother verses of his, which are very clever; but I do not 
                    know muchof him, for foreign poets are very little read among 
                    the Cretans.</p>
                  <p>Megillus. But they are in Lacedaemon, and he appears to be 
                    theprince of them all; the manner of life, however, which 
                    he describes isnot Spartan, but rather Ionian, and he seems 
                    quite to confirm what youare saying, when he traces up the 
                    ancient state of mankind by the helpof tradition to barbarism.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes, he does confirm it; and we may accept his witness 
                    to thefact that such forms of government sometimes arise.</p>
                  <p>Cle. We may.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And were not such states composed of men who had been 
                    dispersedin single habitations and families by the poverty 
                    which attended thedevastations; and did not the eldest then 
                    rule among them, becausewith them government originated in 
                    the authority of a father and amother, whom, like a flock 
                    of birds, they followed, forming onetroop under the patriarchal 
                    rule and sovereignty of their parents,which of all sovereignties 
                    is the most just?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. After this they came together in greater numbers, and 
                    increasedthe size of their cities, and betook themselves to 
                    husbandry, first ofall at the foot of the mountains, and made 
                    enclosures of loose wallsand works of defence, in order to 
                    keep off wild beasts; thuscreating a single large and common 
                    habitation.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes; at least we may suppose so.</p>
                  <p>Ath. There is another thing which would probably happen.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What?</p>
                  <p>Ath. When these larger habitations grew up out of the lesseroriginal 
                    ones, each of the lesser ones would survive in the larger;every 
                    family would be under the rule of the eldest, and, owing totheir 
                    separation from one another, would have peculiar customs inthings 
                    divine and human, which they would have received from theirseveral 
                    parents who had educated them; and these customs would inclinethem 
                    to order, when the parents had the element of order in theirnature, 
                    and to courage, when they had the element of courage. And 
                    theywould naturally stamp upon their children, and upon their 
                    children'schildren, their own likings; and, as we are saying, 
                    they would findtheir way into the larger society, having already 
                    their own peculiarlaws.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And every man surely likes his own laws best, and the 
                    laws ofothers not so well.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then now we seem to have stumbled upon the beginnings 
                    oflegislation.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Exactly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The next step will be that these persons who have met 
                    together,will select some arbiters, who will review the laws 
                    of all of them,and will publicly present such as they approve 
                    to the chiefs wholead the tribes, and who are in a manner 
                    their kings, allowing them tochoose those which they think 
                    best. These persons will themselves becalled legislators, 
                    and will appoint the magistrates, framing somesort of aristocracy, 
                    or perhaps monarchy, out of the dynasties orlordships, and 
                    in this altered state of the government they will live.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes, that would be the natural order of things.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then, now let us speak of a third form of government, 
                    inwhich all other forms and conditions of polities and cities 
                    concur.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is that?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The form which in fact Homer indicates as following 
                    the second.This third form arose when, as he says, Dardanus 
                    founded Dardania:</p>
                  <p>For not as yet had the holy Ilium been built on the plain 
                    to be acity of speaking men; but they were still dwelling 
                    at the foot ofmany-fountained Ida.For indeed, in these verses, 
                    and in what he said of the Cyclopes, hespeaks the words of 
                    God and nature; for poets are a divine race andoften in their 
                    strains, by the aid of the Muses and the Graces, theyattain 
                    truth.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then now let us proceed with the rest of our tale, which 
                    willprobably be found to illustrate in some degree our proposeddesign:-Shall 
                    we do so?</p>
                  <p>Cle. By all means.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Ilium was built, when they descended from the mountain, 
                    in alarge and fair plain, on a sort of low hill, watered by 
                    many riversdescending from Ida.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Such is the tradition.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And we must suppose this event to have taken place many 
                    agesafter the deluge?</p>
                  <p>Ath. A marvellous forgetfulness of the former destruction 
                    wouldappear to have come over them, when they placed their 
                    town right undernumerous streams flowing from the heights, 
                    trusting for their securityto not very high hills, either.</p>
                  <p>Cle. There must have been a long interval, clearly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And, as population increased, many other cities would 
                    beginto be inhabited.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Doubtless.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Those cities made war against Troy-by sea as well as 
                    land-forat that time men were ceasing to be afraid of the 
                    sea.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Clearly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The Achaeans remained ten years, and overthrew Troy.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And during the ten years in which the Achaeans were 
                    besiegingIlium, the homes of the besiegers were falling into 
                    an evil plight.Their youth revolted; and when the soldiers 
                    returned to their owncities and families, they did not receive 
                    them properly, and as theyought to have done, and numerous 
                    deaths, murders, exiles, were theconsequence. The exiles came 
                    again, under a new name, no longerAchaeans, but Dorians-a 
                    name which they derived from Dorieus; for itwas he who gathered 
                    them together. The rest of the story is told byyou Lacedaemonians 
                    as part of the history of Sparta.</p>
                  <p>Meg. To be sure.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Thus, after digressing from the original subject of 
                    laws intomusic and drinking-bouts, the argument has, providentially, 
                    comeback to the same point, and presents to us another handle. 
                    For we havereached the settlement of Lacedaemon; which, as 
                    you truly say, is inlaws and in institutions the sister of 
                    Crete. And we are all thebetter for the digression, because 
                    we have gone through variousgovernments and settlements, and 
                    have been present at the foundationof a first, second, and 
                    third state, succeeding one another ininfinite time. And now 
                    there appears on the horizon a fourth stateor nation which 
                    was once in process of settlement and has continuedsettled 
                    to this day. If, out of all this, we are able to discernwhat 
                    is well or ill settled, and what laws are the salvation andwhat 
                    are the destruction of cities, and what changes would make 
                    astate happy, O Megillus and Cleinias, we may now begin again, 
                    unlesswe have some fault to find with the previous discussion.</p>
                  <p>Meg. If some God, Stranger, would promise us that our new 
                    enquiryabout legislation would be as good and full as the 
                    present, I would goa great way to hear such another, and would 
                    think that a day as longas this-and we are now approaching 
                    the longest day of the year-was tooshort for the discussion.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then I suppose that we must consider this subject?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us place ourselves in thought at the moment when 
                    Lacedaemonand Argos and Messene and the rest of the Peloponnesus 
                    were all incomplete subjection, Megillus, to your ancestors; 
                    for afterwards, asthe legend informs us, they divided their 
                    army into three portions,and settled three cities, Argos, 
                    Messene, Lacedaemon.</p>
                  <p>Meg. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Temenus was the king of Argos, Cresphontes of Messene,Procles 
                    and Eurysthenes of Lacedaemon.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. To these kings all the men of that day made oath that 
                    theywould assist them, if any one subverted their kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Meg. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But can a kingship be destroyed, or was any other form 
                    ofgovernment ever destroyed, by any but the rulers themselves? 
                    Noindeed, by Zeus. Have we already forgotten what was said 
                    a littlewhile ago?</p>
                  <p>Meg. No.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And may we not now further confirm what was then mentioned? 
                    Forwe have come upon facts which have brought us back again 
                    to the sameprinciple; so that, in resuming the discussion, 
                    we shall not beenquiring about an empty theory, but about 
                    events which actuallyhappened. The case was as follows:-Three 
                    royal heroes made oath tothree cities which were under a kingly 
                    government, and the cities tothe kings, that both rulers and 
                    subjects should govern and be governedaccording to the laws 
                    which were common to all of them: the rulerspromised that 
                    as time and the race went forward they would not maketheir 
                    rule more arbitrary; and the subjects said that, if the rulersobserved 
                    these conditions, they would never subvert or permit othersto 
                    subvert those kingdoms; the kings were to assist kings andpeoples 
                    when injured, and the peoples were to assist peoples and kingsin 
                    like manner. Is not this the fact?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And the three states to whom these laws were given, 
                    whethertheir kings or any others were the authors of them, 
                    had thereforethe greatest security for the maintenance of 
                    their constitutions?</p>
                  <p>Meg. What security?</p>
                  <p>Ath. That the other two states were always to come to the 
                    rescueagainst a rebellious third.</p>
                  <p>Meg. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Many persons say that legislators ought to impose such 
                    lawsas the mass of the people will be ready to receive; but 
                    this is justas if one were to command gymnastic masters or 
                    physicians to treator cure their pupils or patients in an 
                    agreeable manner.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Exactly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Whereas the physician may often be too happy if he canrestore 
                    health, and make the body whole, without any very greatinfliction 
                    of pain.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. There was also another advantage possessed by the men 
                    of thatday, which greatly lightened the task of passing laws.</p>
                  <p>Meg. What advantage?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The legislators of that day, when they equalized property,escaped 
                    the great accusation which generally arises in legislation, 
                    ifa person attempts to disturb the possession of land, or 
                    to abolishdebts, because he sees that without this reform 
                    there can never be anyreal equality. Now, in general, when 
                    the legislator attempts to make anew settlement of such matters, 
                    every one meets him with the cry, that&quot;he is not to disturb 
                    vested interests&quot;-declaring with imprecationsthat he 
                    is introducing agrarian laws and cancelling of debts, untila 
                    man is at his wits end; whereas no one could quarrel with 
                    theDorians for distributing the land-there was nothing to 
                    hinder them;and as for debts, they had none which were considerable 
                    or of oldstanding.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But then, my good friends, why did the settlement andlegislation 
                    of their country turn out so badly?</p>
                  <p>Meg. How do you mean; and why do you blame them?</p>
                  <p>Ath. There were three kingdoms, and of these, two quicklycorrupted 
                    their original constitution and laws, and the only one whichremained 
                    was the Spartan.</p>
                  <p>Meg. The question which you ask is not easily answered.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And yet must be answered when we are enquiring about 
                    laws, thisbeing our old man's sober game of play, whereby 
                    we beguile the way, asI was saying when we first set out on 
                    our journey.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Certainly; and we must find out why this was.</p>
                  <p>Ath. What laws are more worthy of our attention than those 
                    whichhave regulated such cities? or what settlements of states 
                    aregreater or more famous?</p>
                  <p>Meg. I know of none.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Can we doubt that your ancestors intended these institutionsnot 
                    only for the protection of Peloponnesus, but of all theHellenes. 
                    in case they were attacked by the barbarian? For theinhabitants 
                    of the region about Ilium, when they provoked by theirinsolence 
                    the Trojan war, relied upon the power of the Assyrians andthe 
                    Empire of Ninus, which still existed and had a great prestige; 
                    thepeople of those days fearing the united Assyrian Empire 
                    just as we nowfear the Great King. And the second capture 
                    of Troy was a seriousoffence against them, because Troy was 
                    a portion of the AssyrianEmpire. To meet the danger the single 
                    army was distributed betweenthree cities by the royal brothers, 
                    sons of Heracles-a fair device, asit seemed, and a far better 
                    arrangement than the expedition againstTroy. For, firstly, 
                    the people of that day had, as they thought, inthe Heraclidae 
                    better leaders than the Pelopidae; in the next place,they 
                    considered that their army was superior in valour to that 
                    whichwent against Troy; for, although the latter conquered 
                    the Trojans,they were themselves conquered by the Heraclidae-Achaeans 
                    byDorians. May we not suppose that this was the intention 
                    with which themen of those days framed the constitutions of 
                    their states?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Quite true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And would not men who had shared with one another many 
                    dangers,and were governed by a single race of royal brothers, 
                    and had takenthe advice of oracles, and in particular of the 
                    Delphian Apollo, belikely to think that such states would 
                    be firmly and lastinglyestablished?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Of course they would.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yet these institutions, of which such great expectations 
                    wereentertained, seem to have all rapidly vanished away; with 
                    theexception, as I was saying, of that small part of them 
                    which existedin yourland.And this third part has never to 
                    this day ceased warringagainst the two others; whereas, if 
                    the original idea had been carriedout, and they had agreed 
                    to be one, their power would have beeninvincible in war.</p>
                  <p>Meg. No doubt.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But what was the ruin of this glorious confederacy? 
                    Here is asubject well worthy of consideration.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Certainly, no one will ever find more striking instances 
                    oflaws or governments being the salvation or destruction of 
                    great andnoble interests, than are here presented to his view.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then now we seem to have happily arrived at a real andimportant 
                    question.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Did you never remark, sage friend, that all men, and 
                    weourselves at this moment, often fancy that they see some 
                    beautifulthing which might have effected wonders if any one 
                    had only knownhow to make a right use of it in some way; and 
                    yet this mode oflooking at things may turn out after all to 
                    be a mistake, and notaccording to nature, either in our own 
                    case or in any other?</p>
                  <p>Meg. To what are you referring, and what do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I was thinking of my own admiration of the aforesaidHeracleid 
                    expedition, which was so noble, and might have had suchwonderful 
                    results for the Hellenes, if only rightly used; and I wasjust 
                    laughing at myself.</p>
                  <p>Meg. But were you not right and wise in speaking as you did, 
                    andwe in assenting to you?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Perhaps; and yet I cannot help observing that any one 
                    whosees anything great or powerful, immediately has the feelingthat-&quot;If 
                    the owner only knew how to use his great and noblepossession, 
                    how happy would he be, and what great results would heachieve!&quot;</p>
                  <p>Meg. And would he not be justified?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Reflect; in what point of view does this sort of praiseappear 
                    just: First, in reference to the question in hand:-If thethen 
                    commanders had known how to arrange their army properly, howwould 
                    they have attained success? Would not this have been the way?They 
                    would have bound them all firmly together and preserved themfor 
                    ever, giving them freedom and dominion at pleasure, combinedwith 
                    the power of doing in the whole world, Hellenic and barbarian,whatever 
                    they and their descendants desired. What other aim would theyhave 
                    had?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Suppose any one were in the same way to express hisadmiration 
                    at the sight of great wealth or family honour, or the like,he 
                    would praise them under the idea that through them he wouldattain 
                    either all or the greater and chief part of what he desires.</p>
                  <p>Meg. He would.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, now, and does not the argument show that there 
                    is onecommon desire of all mankind?</p>
                  <p>Meg. What is it?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The desire which a man has, that all things, if possible-at 
                    anyrate, things human-may come to pass in accordance with 
                    his soul'sdesire.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And having this desire always, and at every time of 
                    life, inyouth, in manhood, in age, he cannot help always praying 
                    for thefulfilment of it.</p>
                  <p>Meg. No doubt.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And we join in the prayers of our friends, and ask for 
                    themwhat they ask for themselves.</p>
                  <p>Meg. We do.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Dear is the son to the father-the younger to the elder.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Of course.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And yet the son often prays to obtain things which the 
                    fatherprays that he may not obtain.</p>
                  <p>Meg. When the son is young and foolish, you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes; or when the father, in the dotage of age or the 
                    heat ofyouth, having no sense of right and justice, prays 
                    with fervour, underthe influence of feelings akin to those 
                    of Theseus when he cursedthe unfortunate Hippolytus, do you 
                    imagine that the son, having asense of right and justice, 
                    will join in his father's prayers?</p>
                  <p>Meg. I understand you to mean that a man should not desire 
                    or bein a hurry to have all things according to his wish, 
                    for his wishmay be at variance with his reason. But every 
                    state and everyindividual ought to pray and strive for wisdom.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes; and I remember, and you will remember, what I said 
                    atfirst, that a statesman and legislator ought to ordain laws 
                    with aview to wisdom; while you were arguing that the good 
                    lawgiver ought toorder all with a view to war. And to this 
                    I replied that there werefour virtues, but that upon your 
                    view one of them only was the aimof legislation; whereas you 
                    ought to regard all virtue, and especiallythat which comes 
                    first, and is the leader of all the rest-I meanwisdom and 
                    mind and opinion, having affection and desire in theirtrain. 
                    And now the argument returns to the same point, and I sayonce 
                    more, in jest if you like, or in earnest if you like, that 
                    theprayer of a fool is full of danger, being likely to end 
                    in theopposite of what he desires. And if you would rather 
                    receive mywords in earnest, I am willing that you should; 
                    and you will find, Isuspect, as I have said already, that 
                    not cowardice was the cause ofthe ruin of the Dorian kings 
                    and of their whole design, norignorance of military matters, 
                    either on the part of the rulers orof their subjects; but 
                    their misfortunes were due to their generaldegeneracy, and 
                    especially to their ignorance of the most importanthuman affairs. 
                    That was then, and is still, and always will be thecase, as 
                    I will endeavour, if you will allow me, to make out anddemonstrate 
                    as well as I am able to you who are my friends, in thecourse 
                    of the argument.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Pray go on, Stranger;-compliments are troublesome, but 
                    wewill show, not in word but in deed, how greatly we prize 
                    your words,for we will give them our best attention; and that 
                    is the way in whicha freeman best shows his approval or disapproval.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Excellent, Cleinias; let us do as you say.</p>
                  <p>Cle. By all means, if Heaven wills. Go on.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, then, proceeding in the same train of thought, 
                    I say thatthe greatest ignorance was the ruin of the Dorian 
                    power, and that now,as then, ignorance is ruin. And if this 
                    be true, the legislator mustendeavour to implant wisdom in 
                    states, and banish ignorance to theutmost of his power.</p>
                  <p>Cle. That is evident.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then now consider what is really the greatest ignorance. 
                    Ishould like to know whether you and Megillus would agree 
                    with me inwhat I am about to say; for my opinion is-</p>
                  <p>Cle. What?</p>
                  <p>Ath. That the greatest ignorance is when a man hates that 
                    which henevertheless thinks to be good and noble, and loves 
                    and embracesthat which he knows to be unrighteous and evil. 
                    This disagreementbetween the sense of pleasure and the judgment 
                    of reason in the soulis, in my opinion, the worst ignorance; 
                    and also the greatest, becauseaffecting the great mass of 
                    the human soul; for the principle whichfeels pleasure and 
                    pain in the individual is like the mass or populacein a state. 
                    And when the soul is opposed to knowledge, or opinion,or reason, 
                    which are her natural lords, that I call folly, just asin 
                    the state, when the multitude refuses to obey their rulers 
                    andthe laws; or, again, in the individual, when fair reasonings 
                    havetheir habitation in the soul and yet do no good, but rather 
                    thereverse of good. All these cases I term the worst ignorance, 
                    whetherin individuals or in states. You will understand, Stranger, 
                    that Iam speaking of something which is very different from 
                    the ignorance ofhandicraftsmen.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes, my friend, we understand and agree.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us, then, in the first place declare and affirm 
                    that thecitizen who does not know these things ought never 
                    to have any kind ofauthority entrusted to him: he must be 
                    stigmatized as ignorant, eventhough he be versed in calculation 
                    and skilled in all sorts ofaccomplishments, and feats of mental 
                    dexterity; and the opposite areto be called wise, even although, 
                    in the words of the proverb, theyknow neither how to read 
                    nor how to swim; and to them, as to men ofsense, authority 
                    is to be committed. For, O my friends, how canthere be the 
                    least shadow of wisdom when there is no harmony? There isnone; 
                    but the noblest and greatest of harmonies may be truly said 
                    tobe the greatest wisdom; and of this he is a partaker who 
                    livesaccording to reason; whereas he who is devoid of reason 
                    is thedestroyer of his house and the very opposite of a saviour 
                    of thestate: he is utterly ignorant of political wisdom. Let 
                    this, then,as I was saying, be laid down by us.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Let it be so laid down.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I suppose that there must be rulers and subjects in 
                    states?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And what are the principles on which men rule and obey 
                    incities, whether great or small; and similarly in families? 
                    What arethey, and how many in number? Is there not one claim 
                    of authoritywhich is always just-that of fathers and mothers 
                    and in general ofprogenitors to rule over their offspring?</p>
                  <p>Cle. There is.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Next follows the principle that the noble should rule 
                    overthe ignoble; and, thirdly, that the elder should rule 
                    and theyounger obey?</p>
                  <p>Cle. To be sure.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And, fourthly, that slaves should be ruled, and their 
                    mastersrule?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Of course.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Fifthly, if I am not mistaken, comes the principle that 
                    thestronger shall rule, and the weaker be ruled?</p>
                  <p>Cle. That is a rule not to be disobeyed.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes, and a rule which prevails very widely among all 
                    creatures,and is according to nature, as the Theban poet Pindar 
                    once said; andthe sixth principle, and the greatest of all, 
                    is, that the wise shouldlead and command, and the ignorant 
                    follow and obey; and yet, O thoumost wise Pindar, as I should 
                    reply him, this surely is not contraryto nature, but according 
                    to nature, being the rule of law over willingsubjects, and 
                    not a rule of compulsion.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Most true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. There is a seventh kind of rule which is awarded by 
                    lot, and isdear to the Gods and a token of good fortune: he 
                    on whom the lot fallsis a ruler, and he who fails in obtaining 
                    the lot goes away and is thesubject; and this we affirm to 
                    be quite just.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. &quot;Then now,&quot; as we say playfully to any of 
                    those who lightlyundertake the making of laws, &quot;you see, 
                    legislator, the principlesof government, how many they are, 
                    and that they are naturallyopposed to each other. There we 
                    have discovered a fountain-head ofseditions, to which you 
                    must attend. And, first, we will ask you toconsider with us, 
                    how and in what respect the kings of Argos andMessene violated 
                    these our maxims, and ruined themselves and the greatand famous 
                    Hellenic power of the olden time. Was it because they didnot 
                    know how wisely Hesiod spoke when he said that the half is 
                    oftenmore than the whole? His meaning was, that when to take 
                    the wholewould be dangerous, and to take the half would be 
                    the safe andmoderate course, then the moderate or better was 
                    more than theimmoderate or worse.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And may we suppose this immoderate spirit to be more 
                    fatal whenfound among kings than when among peoples?</p>
                  <p>Cle. The probability is that ignorance will be a disorder 
                    especiallyprevalent among kings, because they lead a proud 
                    and luxurious life.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Is it not palpable that the chief aim of the kings of 
                    that timewas to get the better of the established laws, and 
                    that they werenot in harmony with the principles which they 
                    had agreed to observe byword and oath? This want of harmony 
                    may have had the appearance ofwisdom, but was really, as we 
                    assert, the greatest ignorance, andutterly overthrew the whole 
                    empire by dissonance and harsh discord.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very likely.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Good; and what measures ought the legislator to have 
                    then takenin order to avert this calamity? Truly there is 
                    no great wisdom inknowing, and no great difficulty in telling, 
                    after the evil hashappened; but to have foreseen the remedy 
                    at the time would have takena much wiser head than ours.</p>
                  <p>Meg. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Any one who looks at what has occurred with you Lacedaemonians,Megillus, 
                    may easily know and may easily say what ought to have beendone 
                    at that time.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Speak a little more clearly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Nothing can be clearer than the observation which I 
                    am about tomake.</p>
                  <p>Meg. What is it?</p>
                  <p>Ath. That if any one gives too great a power to anything, 
                    toolarge a sail to a vessel, too much food to the body, too 
                    muchauthority to the mind, and does not observe the mean, 
                    everything isoverthrown, and, in the wantonness of excess 
                    runs in the one case todisorders, and in the other to injustice, 
                    which is the child ofexcess. I mean to say, my dear friends, 
                    that there is no soul ofman, young and irresponsible, who 
                    will be able to sustain thetemptation of arbitrary power-no 
                    one who will not, under suchcircumstances, become filled with 
                    folly, that worst of diseases, andbe hated by his nearest 
                    and dearest friends: when this happens, hiskingdom is undermined, 
                    and all his power vanishes from him. Andgreat legislators 
                    who know the mean should take heed of the danger. Asfar as 
                    we can guess at this distance of time, what happened was asfollows:-</p>
                  <p>Meg. What?</p>
                  <p>Ath. A God, who watched over Sparta, seeing into the future, 
                    gaveyou two families of kings instead of one; and thus brought 
                    you morewithin the limits of moderation. In the next place, 
                    some humanwisdom mingled with divine power, observing that 
                    the constitution ofyour government was still feverish and 
                    excited, tempered your inbornstrength and pride of birth with 
                    the moderation which comes of age,making the power of your 
                    twenty-eight elders equal with that of thekings in the most 
                    important matters. But your third saviour,perceiving that 
                    your government was still swelling and foaming, anddesirous 
                    to impose a curb upon it, instituted the Ephors, whosepower 
                    he made to resemble that of magistrates elected by lot; and 
                    bythis arrangement the kingly office, being compounded of 
                    the rightelements and duly moderated, was preserved, and was 
                    the means ofpreserving all the rest. Since, if there had been 
                    only the originallegislators, Temenus, Cresphontes, and their 
                    contemporaries, as far asthey were concerned not even the 
                    portion of Aristodemus would havebeen preserved; for they 
                    had no proper experience in legislation, orthey would surely 
                    not have imagined that oaths would moderate ayouthful spirit 
                    invested with a power which might be converted intoa tyranny. 
                    Now that God has instructed us what sort of governmentwould 
                    have been or will be lasting, there is no wisdom, as I havealready 
                    said, in judging after the event; there is no difficulty inlearning 
                    from an example which has already occurred. But if any onecould 
                    have foreseen all this at the time, and had been able tomoderate 
                    the government of the three kingdoms and unite them into one,he 
                    might have saved all the excellent institutions which were 
                    thenconceived; and no Persian or any other armament would 
                    have dared toattack us, or would have regarded Hellas as a 
                    power to be despised.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. There was small credit to us, Cleinias, in defeating 
                    them;and the discredit was, not that the conquerors did not 
                    win gloriousvictories both by land and sea, but what, in my 
                    opinion, broughtdiscredit was, first of all, the circumstance 
                    that of the three citiesone only fought on behalf of Hellas, 
                    and the two others were soutterly good for nothing that the 
                    one was waging a mighty waragainst Lacedaemon, and was thus 
                    preventing her from renderingassistance, while the city of 
                    Argos, which had the precedence at thetime of the distribution, 
                    when asked to aid in repelling thebarbarian, would not answer 
                    to the call, or give aid. Many thingsmight be told about Hellas 
                    in connection with that war which are farfrom honourable; 
                    nor, indeed, can we rightly say that Hellasrepelled the invader; 
                    for the truth is, that unless the Atheniansand Lacedaemonians, 
                    acting in concert, had warded off the impendingyoke, all the 
                    tribes of Hellas would have been fused in a chaos ofHellenes 
                    mingling with one another, of barbarians mingling withHellenes, 
                    and Hellenes with barbarians; just as nations who are nowsubject 
                    to the Persian power, owing to unnatural separations andcombinations 
                    of them, are dispersed and scattered, and live miserably.These, 
                    Cleinias and Megillus, are the reproaches which we have to 
                    makeagainst statesmen and legislators, as they are called, 
                    past andpresent, if we would analyse the causes of their failure, 
                    and find outwhat else might have been done. We said, for instance, 
                    just now,that there ought to be no great and unmixed powers; 
                    and this was underthe idea that a state ought to be free and 
                    wise and harmonious, andthat a legislator ought to legislate 
                    with a view to this end. Nor isthere any reason to be surprised 
                    at our continually proposing aims forthe legislator which 
                    appear not to be always the same; but we shouldconsider when 
                    we say that temperance is to be the aim, or wisdom is tobe 
                    the aim, or friendship is to be the aim, that all these aims 
                    arereally the same; and if so, a variety in the modes of expression 
                    oughtnot to disturb us.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Let us resume the argument in that spirit. And now, 
                    speaking offriendship and wisdom and freedom, I wish that 
                    you would tell me atwhat, in your opinion, the legislator 
                    should aim.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Hear me, then: there are two mother forms of states 
                    fromwhich the rest may be truly said to be derived; and one 
                    of them may becalled monarchy and the other democracy: the 
                    Persians have the highestform of the one, and we of the other; 
                    almost all the rest, as I wassaying, are variations of these. 
                    Now, if you are to have liberty andthe combination of friendship 
                    with wisdom, you must have both theseforms of government in 
                    a measure; the argument emphatically declaresthat no city 
                    can be well governed which is not made up of both.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Impossible.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Neither the one, if it be exclusively and excessivelyattached 
                    to monarchy, nor the other, if it be similarly attached tofreedom, 
                    observes moderation; but your states, the Laconian andCretan, 
                    have more of it; and the same was the case with theAthenians 
                    and Persians of old time, but now they have less. Shall Itell 
                    you why?</p>
                  <p>Cle. By all means, if it will tend to elucidate our subject.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Hear, then:-There was a time when the Persians had more 
                    ofthe state which is a mean between slavery and freedom. In 
                    the reign ofCyrus they were freemen and also lords of many 
                    others: the rulers gavea share of freedom to the subjects, 
                    and being treated as equals, thesoldiers were on better terms 
                    with their generals, and showedthemselves more ready in the 
                    hour of danger. And if there was any wiseman among them, who 
                    was able to give good counsel, he imparted hiswisdom to the 
                    public; for the king was not jealous, but allowed himfull 
                    liberty of speech, and gave honour to those who could advisehim 
                    in any matter. And the nation waxed in all respects, because 
                    therewas freedom and friendship and communion of mind among 
                    them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. That certainly appears to have been the case.</p>
                  <p>Ath. How, then, was this advantage lost under Cambyses, and 
                    againrecovered under Darius? Shall I try to divine?</p>
                  <p>Cle. The enquiry, no doubt, has a bearing upon our subject.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I imagine that Cyrus, though a great and patriotic general, 
                    hadnever given his mind to education, and never attended to 
                    the orderof his household.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What makes you say so?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I think that from his youth upwards he was a soldier, 
                    andentrusted the education of his children to the women; and 
                    they broughtthem up from their childhood as the favourites 
                    of fortune, who wereblessed already, and needed no more blessings. 
                    They thought thatthey were happy enough, and that no one should 
                    be allowed to opposethem in any way, and they compelled every 
                    one to praise all thatthey said or did. This was how they 
                    brought them up.</p>
                  <p>Cle. A splendid education truly!</p>
                  <p>Ath. Such an one as women were likely to give them, and especiallyprincesses 
                    who had recently grown rich, and in the absence of the men,too, 
                    who were occupied in wars and dangers, and had no time to 
                    lookafter them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What would you expect?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Their father had possessions of cattle and sheep, and 
                    manyherds of men and other animals, but he did not consider 
                    that thoseto whom he was about to make them over were not 
                    trained in his owncalling, which was Persian; for the Persians 
                    are shepherds-sons of arugged land, which is a stern mother, 
                    and well fitted to producesturdy race able to live in the 
                    open air and go without sleep, andalso to fight, if fighting 
                    is required. He did not observe that hissons were trained 
                    differently; through the so-called blessing of beingroyal 
                    they were educated in the Median fashion by women and eunuchs,which 
                    led to their becoming such as people do become when they arebrought 
                    up unreproved. And so, after the death of Cyrus, his sons,in 
                    the fulness of luxury and licence, took the kingdom, and firstone 
                    slew the other because he could not endure a rival; and,afterwards, 
                    the slayer himself, mad with wine and brutality, losthis kingdom 
                    through the Medes and the Eunuch, as they called him,who despised 
                    the folly of Cambyses.</p>
                  <p>Cle. So runs the tale, and such probably were the facts.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes; and the tradition says, that the empire came back 
                    to thePersians, through Darius and the seven chiefs.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us note the rest of the story. Observe, that Darius 
                    was notthe son of a king, and had not received a luxurious 
                    education. When hecame to the throne, being one of the seven, 
                    he divided the countryinto seven portions, and of this arrangement 
                    there are some shadowytraces still remaining; he made laws 
                    upon the principle of introducinguniversal equality in the 
                    order of the state, and he embodied in hislaws the settlement 
                    of the tribute which Cyrus promised-thuscreating a feeling 
                    of friendship and community among all the Persians,and attaching 
                    the people to him with money and gifts. Hence his armiescheerfully 
                    acquired for him countries as large as those which Cyrushad 
                    left behind him. Darius was succeeded by his son Xerxes; and 
                    heagain was brought up in the royal and luxurious fashion. 
                    Might wenot most justly say: &quot;O Darius, how came you 
                    to bring up Xerxes in thesame way in which Cyrus brought up 
                    Cambyses, and not to see hisfatal mistake?&quot; For Xerxes, 
                    being the creation of the sameeducation, met with much the 
                    same fortune as Cambyses; and from thattime until now there 
                    has never been a really great king among thePersians, although 
                    they are all called Great. And their degeneracyis not to be 
                    attributed to chance, as I maintain; the reason is ratherthe 
                    evil life which is generally led by the sons of very rich 
                    androyal persons; for never will boy or man, young or old, 
                    excel invirtue, who has been thus educated. And this, I say, 
                    is what thelegislator has to consider, and what at the present 
                    moment has to beconsidered by us. Justly may you, O Lacedaemonians, 
                    be praised, inthat you do not give special honour or a special 
                    education to wealthrather than to poverty, or to a royal rather 
                    than to a privatestation, where the divine and inspired lawgiver 
                    has not originallycommanded them to be given. For no man ought 
                    to have pre-eminenthonour in a state because he surpasses 
                    others in wealth, any more thanbecause he is swift of foot 
                    or fair or strong, unless he have somevirtue in him; nor even 
                    if he have virtue, unless he have thisparticular virtue of 
                    temperance.</p>
                  <p>Meg. What do you mean, Stranger?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I suppose that courage is a part of virtue?</p>
                  <p>Meg. To be sure.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then, now hear and judge for yourself:-Would you like 
                    to havefor a fellow-lodger or neighbour a very courageous 
                    man, who had nocontrol over himself?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Heaven forbid!</p>
                  <p>Ath. Or an artist, who was clever in his profession, but 
                    a rogue?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Certainly not.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And surely justice does not grow apart from temperance?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Impossible.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Any more than our pattern wise man, whom we exhibited 
                    as havinghis pleasures and pains in accordance with and corresponding 
                    to truereason, can be intemperate?</p>
                  <p>Meg. No.</p>
                  <p>Ath. There is a further consideration relating to the due 
                    andundue award of honours in states.</p>
                  <p>Meg. What is it?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I should like to know whether temperance without the 
                    othervirtues, existing alone in the soul of man, is rightly 
                    to be praisedor blamed?</p>
                  <p>Meg. I cannot tell.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And that is the best answer; for whichever alternative 
                    youhad chosen, I think that you would have gone wrong.</p>
                  <p>Meg. I am fortunate.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Very good; a quality, which is a mere appendage of things 
                    whichcan be praised or blamed, does not deserve an expression 
                    of opinion,but is best passed over in silence.</p>
                  <p>Meg. You are speaking of temperance?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes; but of the other virtues, that which having this 
                    appendageis also most beneficial, will be most deserving of 
                    honour, and nextthat which is beneficial in the next degree; 
                    and so each of themwill be rightly honoured according to a 
                    regular order.</p>
                  <p>Meg. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And ought not the legislator to determine these classes?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Certainly he should.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Suppose that we leave to him the arrangement of details. 
                    Butthe general division of laws according to their importance 
                    into afirst and second and third class, we who are lovers 
                    of law may makeourselves.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Very; good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. We maintain, then, that a State which would be safe 
                    andhappy, as far as the nature of man allows, must and ought 
                    todistribute honour and dishonour in the right way. And the 
                    right way isto place the goods of the soul first and highest 
                    in the scale,always assuming temperance to be the condition 
                    of them; and toassign the second place to the goods of the 
                    body; and the thirdplace to money and property. And it any 
                    legislator or state departsfrom this rule by giving money 
                    the place of honour, or in any waypreferring that which is 
                    really last, may we not say, that he or thestate is doing 
                    an unholy and unpatriotic thing?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Yes; let that be plainly declared.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The consideration of the Persian governments led us 
                    thus far toenlarge. We remarked that the Persians grew worse 
                    and worse. And weaffirm the reason of this to have been, that 
                    they too muchdiminished the freedom of the people, and introduced 
                    too much ofdespotism, and so destroyed friendship and community 
                    of feeling. Andwhen there is an end of these, no longer do 
                    the governors govern onbehalf of their subjects or of the 
                    people, but on behalf ofthemselves; and if they think that 
                    they can gain ever so small anadvantage for themselves, they 
                    devastate cities, and send fire anddesolation among friendly 
                    races. And as they hate ruthlessly andhorribly, so are they 
                    hated; and when they want the people to fightfor them, they 
                    find no community of feeling or willingness to risktheir lives 
                    on their behalf; their untold myriads are useless tothem on 
                    the field of battle, and they think that their salvationdepends 
                    on the employment of mercenaries and strangers whom they hire,as 
                    if they were in want of more men. And they cannot help beingstupid, 
                    since they proclaim by actions that the ordinarydistinctions 
                    of right and wrong which are made in a state are atrifle, 
                    when compared with gold and silver.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Quite true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And now enough of the Persians, and their presentmaladministration 
                    of their government, which is owing to the excess ofslavery 
                    and despotism among them.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Next, we must pass in review the government of Attica 
                    in likemanner, and from this show that entire freedom and 
                    the absence ofall superior authority is not by any means so 
                    good as government byothers when properly limited, which was 
                    our ancient Athenianconstitution at the time when the Persians 
                    made their attack onHellas, or, speaking more correctly, on 
                    the whole continent of Europe.There were four classes, arranged 
                    according to a property census,and reverence was our queen 
                    and mistress, and made us willing tolive in obedience to the 
                    laws which then prevailed. Also thevastness of the Persian 
                    armament, both by sea and on land, caused ahelpless terror, 
                    which made us more and more the servants of ourrulers and 
                    of the laws; and for all these reasons an exceeding harmonyprevailed 
                    among us. About ten years before the naval engagement atSalamis, 
                    Datis came, leading a Persian host by command of Darius,which 
                    was expressly directed against the Athenians and Eretrians,having 
                    orders to carry them away captive; and these orders he was 
                    toexecute under pain of death. Now Datis and his myriads soon 
                    becamecomplete masters of Eretria, and he sent a fearful report 
                    to Athensthat no Eretrian had escaped him; for the soldiers 
                    of Datis had joinedhands and netted the whole of Eretria. 
                    And this report, whether wellor ill founded, was terrible 
                    to all the Hellenes, and above all to theAthenians, and they 
                    dispatched embassies in all directions, but no onewas willing 
                    to come to their relief, with the exception of theLacedaemonians; 
                    and they, either because they were detained by theMessenian 
                    war, which was then going on, or for some other reason ofwhich 
                    we are not told, came a day too late for the battle of Marathon.After 
                    a while, the news arrived of mighty preparations being made, 
                    andinnumerable threats came from the king. Then, as time went 
                    on, arumour reached us that Darius had died, and that his 
                    son, who wasyoung and hot-headed, had come to the throne and 
                    was persisting in hisdesign. The Athenians were under the 
                    impression that the wholeexpedition was directed against them, 
                    in consequence of the battleof Marathon; and hearing of the 
                    bridge over the Hellespont, and thecanal of Athos, and the 
                    host of ships, considering that there was nosalvation for 
                    them either by land or by sea, for there was no one tohelp 
                    them, and remembering that in the first expedition, when thePersians 
                    destroyed Eretria, no one came to their help, or would riskthe 
                    danger of an alliance with them, they thought that this wouldhappen 
                    again, at least on land; nor, when they looked to the sea,could 
                    they descry any hope of salvation; for they were attacked 
                    by athousand vessels and more. One chance of safety remained, 
                    slightindeed and desperate, but their only one. They saw that 
                    on theformer occasion they had gained a seemingly impossible 
                    victory, andborne up by this hope, they found that their only 
                    refuge was inthemselves and in the Gods. All these things 
                    created in them thespirit of friendship; there was the fear 
                    of the moment, and therewas that higher fear, which they had 
                    acquired by obedience to theirancient laws, and which I have 
                    several times in the precedingdiscourse called reverence, 
                    of which the good man ought to be awilling servant, and of 
                    which the coward is independent andfearless. If this fear 
                    had not possessed them, they would never havemet the enemy, 
                    or defended their temples and sepulchres and theircountry, 
                    and everything that was near and dear to them, as they did;but 
                    little by little they would have been all scattered and dispersed.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Your words, Athenian, are quite true, and worthy of 
                    yourselfand of your country.</p>
                  <p>Ath. They are true, Megillus; and to you, who have inherited 
                    thevirtues of your ancestors, I may properly speak of the 
                    actions of thatday. And I would wish you and Cleinias to consider 
                    whether my wordshave not also a bearing on legislation; for 
                    I am not discoursingonly for the pleasure of talking, but 
                    for the argument's sake.Please to remark that the experience 
                    both of ourselves and thePersians was, in a certain sense, 
                    the same; for as they led theirpeople into utter servitude, 
                    so we too led ours into all freedom.And now, how shall we 
                    proceed? for I would like you to observe thatour previous 
                    arguments have good deal to say for themselves.</p>
                  <p>Meg. True; but I wish that you would give us a fuller explanation.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I will. Under the ancient laws, my friends, the people 
                    wasnot as now the master, but rather the willing servant of 
                    the laws.</p>
                  <p>Meg. What laws do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. In the first place, let us speak of the laws about music-thatis 
                    to say, such music as then existed-in order that we may trace 
                    thegrowth of the excess of freedom from the beginning. Now 
                    music wasearly divided among us into certain kinds and manners. 
                    One sortconsisted of prayers to the Gods, which were called 
                    hymns; and therewas another and opposite sort called lamentations, 
                    and anothertermed paeans, and another, celebrating the birth 
                    of Dionysus, called,I believe, &quot;dithyrambs.&quot; And 
                    they used the actual word &quot;laws,&quot; ornomoi, for another 
                    kind of song; and to this they added the term&quot;citharoedic.&quot; 
                    All these and others were duly distinguished, norwere the 
                    performers allowed to confuse one style of music withanother. 
                    And the authority which determined and gave judgment, andpunished 
                    the disobedient, was not expressed in a hiss, nor in the mostunmusical 
                    shouts of the multitude, as in our days, nor in applause andclapping 
                    of hands. But the directors of public instruction insistedthat 
                    the spectators should listen in silence to the end; and boysand 
                    their tutors, and the multitude in general, were kept quiet 
                    by ahint from a stick. Such was the good order which the multitude 
                    werewilling to observe; they would never have dared to give 
                    judgment bynoisy cries. And then, as time went on, the poets 
                    themselvesintroduced the reign of vulgar and lawless innovation. 
                    They were menof genius, but they had no perception of what 
                    is just and lawful inmusic; raging like Bacchanals and possessed 
                    with inordinatedelights-mingling lamentations with hymns, 
                    and paeans with dithyrambs;imitating the sounds of the flute 
                    on the lyre, and making onegeneral confusion; ignorantly affirming 
                    that music has no truth,and, whether good or bad, can only 
                    be judged of rightly by thepleasure of the hearer. And by 
                    composing such licentious works, andadding to them words as 
                    licentious, they have inspired the multitudewith lawlessness 
                    and boldness, and made them fancy that they can judgefor themselves 
                    about melody and song. And in this way the theatresfrom being 
                    mute have become vocal, as though they had understanding ofgood 
                    and bad in music and poetry; and instead of an aristocracy, 
                    anevil sort of theatrocracy has grown up. For if the democracy 
                    whichjudged had only consisted of educated persons, no fatal 
                    harm wouldhave been done; but in music there first arose the 
                    universal conceitof omniscience and general lawlessness;-freedom 
                    came followingafterwards, and men, fancying that they knew 
                    what they did not know,had no longer any fear, and the absence 
                    of fear begetsshamelessness. For what is this shamelessness, 
                    which is so evil athing, but the insolent refusal to regard 
                    the opinion of the better byreason of an over-daring sort 
                    of liberty?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Consequent upon this freedom comes the other freedom, 
                    ofdisobedience to rulers; and then the attempt to escape the 
                    control andexhortation of father, mother, elders, and when 
                    near the end, thecontrol of the laws also; and at the very 
                    end there is the contempt ofoaths and pledges, and no regard 
                    at all for the Gods-herein theyexhibit and imitate the old 
                    so called Titanic nature, and come tothe same point as the 
                    Titans when they rebelled against God, leading alife of endless 
                    evils. But why have I said all this? I ask, becausethe argument 
                    ought to be pulled up from time to time, and not beallowed 
                    to run away, but held with bit and bridle, and then we shallnot, 
                    as the proverb says, fall off our ass. Let us then once moreask 
                    the question, To what end has all this been said?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. This, then, has been said for the sake-</p>
                  <p>Meg. Of what?</p>
                  <p>Ath. We were maintaining that the lawgiver ought to have 
                    threethings in view: first, that the city for which he legislates 
                    should befree; and secondly, be at unity with herself; and 
                    thirdly, should haveunderstanding;-these were our principles, 
                    were they not?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. With a view to this we selected two kinds of government, 
                    thedespotic, and the other the most free; and now we are consideringwhich 
                    of them is the right form: we took a mean in both cases, ofdespotism 
                    in the one, and of liberty in the other, and we saw thatin 
                    a mean they attained their perfection; but that when they 
                    werecarried to the extreme of either, slavery or licence, 
                    neither partywere the gainers.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And that was our reason for considering the settlement 
                    of theDorian army, and of the city built by Dardanus at the 
                    foot of themountains, and the removal of cities to the seashore, 
                    and of ourmention of the first men, who were the survivors 
                    of the deluge. Andall that was previously said about music 
                    and drinking, and whatpreceded, was said with the view of 
                    seeing how a state might be bestadministered, and how an individual 
                    might best order his own life. Andnow, Megillus and Cleinias, 
                    how can we put to the proof the value ofour words?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Stranger, I think that I see how a proof of their value 
                    maybe obtained. This discussion of ours appears to me to have 
                    beensingularly fortunate, and just what I at this moment want; 
                    mostauspiciously have you and my friend Megillus come in my 
                    way. For Iwill tell you what has happened to me; and I regard 
                    the coincidence asa sort of omen. The greater part of Crete 
                    is going to send out acolony, and they have entrusted the 
                    management of the affair to theCnosians; and the Cnosian government 
                    to me and nine others. And theydesire us to give them any 
                    laws which we please, whether taken fromthe Cretan model or 
                    from any other; and they do not mind about theirbeing foreign 
                    if they are better. Grant me then this favour, whichwill also 
                    be a gain to yourselves:-Let us make a selection from whathas 
                    been said, and then let us imagine a State of which we willsuppose 
                    ourselves to be the original founders. Thus we shall proceedwith 
                    our enquiry, and, at the same time, I may have the use of 
                    theframework which you are constructing, for the city which 
                    is incontemplation.</p>
                  <p> Ath. Good news, Cleinias; if Megillus has no objection, 
                    you maybe sure that I will do all in my power to please you.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Thank you.</p>
                  <p>Meg. And so will I.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Excellent; and now let us begin to frame the State.</p>

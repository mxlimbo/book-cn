                    Athenian Stranger. Next, with the help of the Delphian oracle, 
                    wehave to institute festivals and make laws about them, and 
                    to determinewhat sacrifices will be for the good of the city, 
                    and to what Godsthey shall be offered; but when they shall 
                    be offered, and howoften, may be partly regulated by us.</p>
                  <p>Cleinias. The number-yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then we will first determine the number; and let the 
                    wholenumber be 365-one for every day-so that one magistrate 
                    at least willsacrifice daily to some God or demi-god on behalf 
                    of the city, and thecitizens, and their possessions. And the 
                    interpreters, and priests,and priestesses, and prophets shall 
                    meet, and, in company with theguardians of the law, ordain 
                    those things which the legislator ofnecessity omits; and I 
                    may remark that they are the very persons whoought to take 
                    note of what is omitted. The law will say that there aretwelve 
                    feasts dedicated to the twelve Gods, after whom the severaltribes 
                    are named; and that to each of them they shall sacrificeevery 
                    month, and appoint choruses, and musical and gymnastic contests,assigning 
                    them so as to suit the Gods and seasons of the year. Andthey 
                    shall have festivals for women, distinguishing those whichought 
                    to be separated from the men's festivals, and those whichought 
                    not. Further, they shall not confuse the infernal deities 
                    andtheir rites with the Gods who are termed heavenly and their 
                    rites, butshall separate them, giving to Pluto his own in 
                    the twelfth month,which is sacred to him, according to the 
                    law. To such a deitywarlike men should entertain no aversion, 
                    but they should honour himas being always the best friend 
                    of man. For the connection of soul andbody is no way better 
                    than the dissolution of them, as I am ready tomaintain quite 
                    seriously. Moreover, those who would regulate thesematters 
                    rightly should consider, that our city among existing citieshas 
                    fellow, either in respect of leisure or comin and of thenecessaries 
                    of life, and that like an individual she ought to livehappily. 
                    And those who would live happily should in the first place 
                    dono wrong to one another, and ought not themselves to be 
                    wronged byothers; to attain the first is not difficult, but 
                    there is greatdifficulty, in acquiring the power of not being 
                    wronged. No man can beperfectly secure against wrong, unless 
                    he has become perfectly good;and cities are like individuals 
                    in this, for a city if good has a lifeof peace, but if evil, 
                    a life of war within and without. Wherefore thecitizens ought 
                    to practise war-not in time of war, but rather whilethey are 
                    at peace. And every city which has any sense, should take 
                    thefield at least for one day in every month; and for more 
                    if themagistrates think fit, having no regard to winter cold 
                    or summer heat;and they should go out en masse, including 
                    their wives and theirchildren, when the magistrates determine 
                    to lead forth the wholepeople, or in separate portions when 
                    summoned by them; and they shouldalways provide that there 
                    should be games and sacrificial feasts,and they should have 
                    tournaments, imitating in as lively a manner asthey can real 
                    battles. And they should distribute prizes of victoryand valour 
                    to the competitors, passing censures and encomiums on oneanother 
                    according to the characters which they bear in the contestsand 
                    their whole life, honouring him who seems to be the best, 
                    andblaming him who is the opposite. And let poets celebrate 
                    thevictors-not however every poet, but only one who in the 
                    first place isnot less than fifty years of age; nor should 
                    he be one who, althoughhe may have musical and poetical gifts, 
                    has never in his life done anynoble or illustrious action; 
                    but those who are themselves good andalso honourable in the 
                    state, creators of noble actions-let theirpoems be sung, even 
                    though they be not very musical. And let thejudgment of them 
                    rest with the instructor of youth and the otherguardians of 
                    the laws, who shall give them this privilege, and theyalone 
                    shall be free to sing; but the rest of the world shall nothave 
                    this liberty. Nor shall any one dare to sing a song which 
                    has notbeen approved by the judgment of the guardians of the 
                    laws, not evenif his strain be sweeter than the songs of Thamyras 
                    and Orpheus; butonly and Orpheus; but only such poems as have 
                    been judged sacred anddedicated to the Gods, and such as are 
                    the works of good men, whichpraise of blame has been awarded 
                    and which have been deemed tofulfil their design fairly.</p>
                  <p>The regulations about and about liberty of speech in poitry, 
                    oughtto apply equally to men and women. The legislator may 
                    be supposed toargue the question in his own mind:-Who are 
                    my citizens for whom Ihave set in order the city? Are they 
                    not competitors in the greatestof all contests, and have they 
                    not innumerable rivals? To be sure,will be the natural, reply. 
                    Well, but if we were training boxers, orpancratiasts, or any 
                    other sort of athletes, would they never meetuntil the hour 
                    of contest arrived; and should we do nothing to prepareourselves 
                    previously by daily practice? Surely, if we were boxers weshould 
                    have been learning to fight for many days before, andexercising 
                    ourselves in imitating all those blows and wards which wewere 
                    intending to use in the hour of conflict; and in order that 
                    wemight come as near to reality as possible, instead of cestuses 
                    weshould put on boxing gloves, that the blows and the wards 
                    might bepractised by us to the utmost of our power. And if 
                    there were a lackof competitors, the ridicule of fools would 
                    ryot deter us from hangingup a lifeless image and practising 
                    at that. Or if we had noadversary at all, animate or inanimate, 
                    should we not venture in thedearth of antagonists to spar 
                    by ourselves? In what other manner couldwe ever study the 
                    art of self-defence?</p>
                  <p>Cle. The way which you mention Stranger, would be the only 
                    way.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And shall the warriors of our city, who are destined 
                    whenoccasion calli to enter the greatest of all contests, 
                    and to fight fortheir lives, and their children, and their 
                    property, and the wholecity, be worse prepared than boxers? 
                    And will the legislator,because he is afraid that their practising 
                    with one another may appearto some ridiculous, abstain from 
                    commanding them to go out andfight; will he not ordain that 
                    soldiers shall perform lesser exerciseswithout arms every 
                    day, making dancing and all gymnastic tend tothis end; and 
                    also will he not require that they shall practise somegymnastic 
                    exercises, greater as well as lesser, as often as everymonth; 
                    and that they shall have contests one with another in everypart 
                    of the country, seizing upon posts and lying in ambush, andimitating 
                    in every respect the reality of war; fighting withboxing-gloves 
                    and hurling javelins, and using weapons somewhatdangerous, 
                    and as nearly as possible like the true ones, in order thatthe 
                    sport may not be altogether without fear, but may have terrors 
                    andto a certain degree show the man who has and who has not 
                    courage;and that the honour and dishonour which are assigned 
                    to themrespectively, may prepare the whole city for the true 
                    conflict oflife? If any one dies in these mimic contests, 
                    the homicide isinvoluntary, and we will make the slayer, when 
                    he has been purifiedaccording to law, to be pure of blood, 
                    considering that if a few menshould die, others as good as 
                    they will be born; but that if fear isdead then the citizens 
                    will never find a test of superior and inferiornatures, which 
                    is a far greater evil to the state than the loss of afew.</p>
                  <p>Cle. We are quite agreed, Stranger, that we should legislate 
                    aboutsuch things, and that the whole state should practise 
                    them supposed</p>
                  <p>Ath. And what is the reason that dances and contests of this 
                    sorthardly ever exist in states, at least not to any extent 
                    worth speakingof? Is this due to the ignorance of mankind 
                    and their legislators?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Perhaps.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Certainly not, sweet Cleinias; there are two causes, 
                    whichare quite enough to account for the deficiency.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What are they?</p>
                  <p>Ath. One cause is the love of wealth, which wholly absorbs 
                    men,and never for a moment allows them to think of anything 
                    but theirown private possessions; on this the soul of every 
                    citizen hangssuspended, and can attend to nothing but his 
                    daily gain; mankind areready to learn any branch of knowledge, 
                    and to follow any pursuitwhich tends to this end, and they 
                    laugh at every other:-that is onereason why a city will not 
                    be in earnest about such contests or anyother good and honourable 
                    pursuit. But from an insatiable love of goldand silver, every 
                    man will stoop to any art or contrivance, seemlyor unseemly, 
                    in the hope of becoming rich; and will make noobjection to 
                    performing any action, holy, or unholy and utterlybase, if 
                    only like a beast he have the power of eating and drinkingall 
                    kinds of things, and procuring for himself in every sort of 
                    waythe gratification of his lusts.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let this, then, be deemed one of the causes which preventstates 
                    from pursuing in an efficient manner the art of war, or anyother 
                    noble aim, but makes the orderly and temperate part of mankindinto 
                    merchants, and captains of ships, and servants, and convertsthe 
                    valiant sort into thieves and burglars and robbers of temples, 
                    andviolent, tyrannical persons; many of whom are not without 
                    ability, butthey are unfortunate.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Must not they be truly unfortunate whose souls are compelled 
                    topass through life always hungering?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Then that is one cause, Stranger; but you spoke of another.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Thank you for reminding me.</p>
                  <p>Cle. The insatiable life long love of wealth, as you were 
                    sayingis one clause which absorbs mankind, and prevents them 
                    from rightlypractising the arts of war:-Granted; and now tell 
                    me, what is theother?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Do you imagine that I delay because I am in a perplexity?</p>
                  <p>Cle. No; but we think that you are too severe upon themoney-loving 
                    temper, of which you seem in the present discussion tohave 
                    a peculiar dislike.</p>
                  <p> Ath. That is a very fair rebuke, Cleinias; and I will now 
                    proceedto the second cause.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Proceed.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I say that governments are a cause-democracy, oligarchy,tyranny, 
                    concerning which I have often spoken in the previousdiscourse; 
                    or rather governments they are not, for none of themexercises 
                    a voluntary rule over voluntary subjects; but they may betruly 
                    called states of discord, in which while the government isvoluntary, 
                    the subjects always obey against their will, and have to becoerced; 
                    and the ruler fears the subject, and will not, if he canhelp, 
                    allow him to become either noble, or rich, or strong, orvaliant, 
                    or warlike at all. These two are the chief causes of almostall 
                    evils, and of the evils of which I have been speaking they 
                    arenotably the causes. But our state has escaped both of them; 
                    for hercitizens have the greatest leisure, and they are not 
                    subject to oneanother, and will, I think, be made by these 
                    laws the reverse oflovers of money. Such a constitution may 
                    be reasonably supposed tobe the only one existing which will 
                    accept the education which we havedescribed, and the martial 
                    pastimes which have been perfectedaccording to our idea.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then next we must remember, about all gymnastic contests,that 
                    only the warlike sort of them are to be practised and to haveprizes 
                    of victory; and those which are not military are to be givenup. 
                    The military sort had better be completely described andestablished 
                    by law; and first, let us speak of running and swiftness.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Certainly the most military of all qualities is generalactivity 
                    of body, whether of foot or hand. For escaping or forcapturing 
                    an enemy, quickness of foot is required; but hand-to-handconflict 
                    and combat need vigour and strength.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Neither of them can attain their greatest efficiency 
                    withoutarms.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How can they?</p>
                  <p> Ath. Then our herald, in accordance with the prevailing 
                    practice,will first summon the runner;-he will appear armed, 
                    for to anunarmed competitor we will not give a prize. And 
                    he shall enterfirst who is to run the single course bearing 
                    arms; next, he who is torun the double course; third, he who 
                    is to run the horse-course; andfourthly, he who is to run 
                    the long course; the fifth whom we start,shall be the first 
                    sent forth in heavy armour, and shall run acourse of sixty 
                    stadia to some temple of Ares-and we will send forthanother, 
                    whom we will style the more heavily armed, to run oversmoother 
                    ground. There remains the archer; and he shall run in thefull 
                    equipments of an archer a distance of 100 stadia overmountains, 
                    and across every sort of country, to a temple of Apollo andArtemis; 
                    this shall be the order of the contest, and we will waitfor 
                    them until they return, and will give a prize to the conquerorin 
                    each.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us suppose that there are three kinds of contests-one 
                    ofboys, another of beardless youths, and a third of men. For 
                    theyouths we will fix the length of the contest at two-thirds, 
                    and forthe boys at half of the entire course, whether they 
                    contend as archersor as heavy armed. Touching the women, let 
                    the girls who are not grownup compete naked in the stadium 
                    and the double course, and thehorse-course and the long course, 
                    and let them run on therace-ground itself; those who are thirteen 
                    years of age and upwardsuntil their marriage shall continue 
                    to share in contests if they arenot more than twenty, and 
                    shall be compelled to run up to eighteen;and they shall descend 
                    into the arena in suitable dresses. Let thesebe the regulations 
                    about contests in running both for men and women.</p>
                  <p>Respecting contests of strength, instead of wrestling and 
                    similarcontests of the heavier sort, we will institute conflicts 
                    in armour ofone against one, and two against two, and so on 
                    up to ten against ten.As to what a man ought not to suffer 
                    or do, and to what extent, inorder to gain the victory-as 
                    in wrestling, the masters of the art havelaid down what is 
                    fair and what is not fair, so in fighting inarmour-we ought 
                    to call in skilful persons, who shall judge for us andbe our 
                    assessors in the work of legislation; they shall say whodeserves 
                    to be victor in combats of this sort, and what he is not todo 
                    or have done to him, and in like manner what rule determines 
                    who isdefeated; and let these ordinances apply to women until 
                    they marriedas well as to men. The pancration shall have a 
                    counterpart in a combatof the light armed; they shall contend 
                    with bows and with lightshields and with javelins and in the 
                    throwing of stones by slingsand by hand: and laws shall be 
                    made about it, and rewards and prizesgiven to him who best 
                    fulfils the ordinances of the law.</p>
                  <p>Next in order we shall have to legislate about the horse 
                    contests.Now we do not need many horses, for they cannot be 
                    of much use in acountry like Crete, and hence we naturally 
                    do not take great painsabout the rearing of them or about 
                    horse races. There is no one whokeeps a chariot among us, 
                    and any rivalry in such matters would bealtogether out of 
                    place; there would be no sense nor any shadow ofsense in instituting 
                    contests which are not after the manner of ourcountry. And 
                    therefore we give our prizes for single horses-forcolts who 
                    have not yet cast their teeth, and for those who areintermediate, 
                    and for the full-grown horses themselves; and thus ourequestrian 
                    games will accord with the nature of the country. Letthem 
                    have conflict and rivalry in these matters in accordance with 
                    thelaw, and let the colonels and generals of horse decide 
                    togetherabout all courses and about the armed competitors 
                    in them. But we havenothing to say to the unarmed either in 
                    gymnastic exercises or inthese contests. On the other hand, 
                    the Cretan bowman or javelin-manwho fights in armour on horseback 
                    is useful, and therefore we may aswell place a competition 
                    of this sort among amusements. Women arenot to be forced to 
                    compete by laws and ordinances; but if fromprevious training 
                    they have acquired the habit and are strong enoughand like 
                    to take part, let them do so, girls as well as boys, and noblame 
                    to them.</p>
                  <p>Thus the competition in gymnastic and the mode of learning 
                    it havebeen described; and we have spoken also of the toils 
                    of the contest,and of daily exercises under the superintendence 
                    of masters. Likewise,what relates to music has been, for the 
                    most part, completed. But asto rhapsodes and the like, and 
                    the contests of choruses which are toperform at feasts, all 
                    this shall be arranged when the months and daysand years have 
                    been appointed for Gods and demi-gods, whether everythird 
                    year, or again every fifth year, or in whatever way or mannerthe 
                    Gods may put into men's minds the distribution and order ofthem. 
                    At the same time, we may expect that the musical contests 
                    willbe celebrated in their turn by the command of the judges 
                    and thedirector of education and the guardians of the law 
                    meeting togetherfor this purpose, and themselves becoming 
                    legislators of the times andnature and conditions of the choral 
                    contests and of dancing ingeneral. What they ought severally 
                    to be in language and song, andin the admixture of harmony 
                    with rhythm and the dance, has beenoften declared by the original 
                    legislator; and his successors ought tofollow him, making 
                    the games and sacrifices duly to correspond atfitting times, 
                    and appointing public festivals. It is not difficult todetermine 
                    how these and the like matters may have a regular order;nor, 
                    again, will the alteration of them do any great good or harm 
                    tothe state. There is, however, another matter of great importance 
                    anddifficulty, concerning which God should legislate, if there 
                    were anypossibility of obtaining from him an ordinance about 
                    it. But seeingthat divine aid is not to be had, there appears 
                    to be a need of somebold man who specially honours plainness 
                    of speech, and will sayoutright what he thinks best for the 
                    city and citizens-ordainingwhat is good and convenient for 
                    the whole state amid the corruptionsof human souls, opposing 
                    the mightiest lusts, and having no man hishelper but himself 
                    standing alone and following reason only.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is this, Stranger, that you are saying? For we 
                    do not asyet understand your meaning.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Very likely; I will endeavour to explain myself more 
                    clearly.When I came to the subject of education, I beheld 
                    young men andmaidens holding friendly intercourse with one 
                    another. And therenaturally arose in my mind a sort of apprehension-I 
                    could not helpthinking how one is to deal with a city in which 
                    youths and maidensare well nurtured, and have nothing to do, 
                    and are not undergoingthe excessive and servile toils which 
                    extinguish wantonness, and whoseonly cares during their whole 
                    life are sacrifices and festivals anddances. How, in such 
                    a state as this, will they abstain from desireswhich thrust 
                    many a man and woman into perdition; and from whichreason, 
                    assuming the functions of law, commands them to abstain? Theordinances 
                    already made may possibly get the better of most of thesedesires; 
                    the prohibition of excessive wealth is a very considerablegain 
                    in the direction of temperance, and the whole education of 
                    ouryouth imposes a law of moderation on them; moreover, the 
                    eye of therulers is required always to watch over the young, 
                    and never to losesight of them; and these provisions do, as 
                    far as human means caneffect anything, exercise a regulating 
                    influence upon the desires ingeneral. But how can we take 
                    precautions against the unnatural lovesof either sex, from 
                    which innumerable evils have come upon individualsand cities? 
                    How shall we devise a remedy and way of escape out of sogreat 
                    a danger? Truly, Cleinias, here is a difficulty. In many waysCrete 
                    and Lacedaemon furnish a great help to those who make peculiarlaws; 
                    but in the matter of love, as we are alone, I must confessthat 
                    they are quite against us. For if any one following nature 
                    shouldlay down the law which existed before the days of Laius, 
                    anddenounce these lusts as contrary to nature, adducing the 
                    animals asa proof that such unions were monstrous, he might 
                    prove his point, buthe would be wholly at variance with the 
                    custom of your states.Further, they are repugnant to a principle 
                    which we say that alegislator should always observe; for we 
                    are always enquiring which ofour enactments tends to virtue 
                    and which not. And suppose we grantthat these loves are accounted 
                    by law to be honourable, or at leastnot disgraceful, in what 
                    degree will they contribute to virtue? Willsuch passions implant 
                    in the soul of him who is seduced the habit ofcourage, or 
                    in the soul of the seducer the principle of temperance?Who 
                    will ever believe this?-or rather, who will not blame theeffeminacy 
                    of him who yields to pleasures and is unable to hold outagainst 
                    them? Will not all men censure as womanly him who imitates 
                    thewoman? And who would ever think of establishing such a 
                    practice bylaw? Certainly no one who had in his mind the image 
                    of true law. Howcan we prove, that what I am saying is true? 
                    He who would rightlyconsider these matters must see the nature 
                    of friendship and desire,and of these so-called loves, for 
                    they are of two kinds, and out ofthe two arises a third kind, 
                    having the same name; and this similarityof name causes all 
                    the difficulty and obscurity.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How is that?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Dear is the like in virtue to the like, and the equal 
                    to theequal; dear also, though unlike, is he who has abundance 
                    to him who isin want. And when either of these friendships 
                    becomes excessive, weterm the excess love.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The friendship which arises from contraries is horrible 
                    andcoarse, and has often no tie of communion; but that which, 
                    arises fromlikeness is gentle, and has a tie of communion 
                    which lasts throughlife. As to the mixed sort which is made 
                    up of them both, there is,first of all, a in determining what 
                    he who is possessed by thisthird love desires; moreover, he 
                    is drawn different ways, and is indoubt between the two principles; 
                    the one exhorting him to enjoy thebeauty of youth, and the 
                    other forbidding him. For the one is alover of the body, and 
                    hungers after beauty, like ripe fruit, andwould fain satisfy 
                    himself without any regard to the character ofthe beloved; 
                    the other holds the desire of the body to be asecondary matter, 
                    and looking rather than loving and with his souldesiring the 
                    soul of the other in a becoming manner, regards thesatisfaction 
                    of the bodily love as wantonness; he reverences andrespects 
                    temperance and courage and magnanimity and wisdom, and wishesto 
                    live chastely with the chaste object of his affection. Now 
                    the sortof love which is made up of the other two is that 
                    which we havedescribed as the third. Seeing then that there 
                    are these three sortsof love, ought the law to prohibit and 
                    forbid them all to existamong us? Is it not rather clear that 
                    we should wish to have in thestate the love which is of virtue 
                    and which desires the belovedyouth to be the best possible; 
                    and the other two, if possible, weshould hinder? What do you 
                    say, friend Megillus?</p>
                  <p>Megillus. I think, Stranger, that you are perfectly right 
                    in whatyou have been now saying.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I knew well, my friend, that I should obtain your assent, 
                    whichI accept, and therefore have no need to analyse your 
                    custom anyfurther. Cleinias shall be prevailed upon to give 
                    me his assent atsome other time. Enough of this; and now let 
                    us proceed to the laws.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Upon reflection I see a way of imposing the law, which, 
                    inone respect, is easy, but, in another, is of the utmost 
                    difficulty.</p>
                  <p>Meg. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p> Ath. We are all aware that most men, in spite of their lawlessnatures, 
                    are very strictly and precisely restrained from intercoursewith 
                    the fair, and this is not at all against their will, but entirelywith 
                    their will.</p>
                  <p>Meg. When do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. When any one has a brother or sister who is fair; and 
                    about ason or daughter the same unwritten law holds, and is 
                    a most perfectsafeguard, so that no open or secret connection 
                    ever takes placebetween them. Nor does the thought of such 
                    a thing ever enter at allinto the minds of most of them.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Does not a little word extinguish all pleasures of that 
                    sort?</p>
                  <p>Meg. What word?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The declaration that they are unholy, hated of God, 
                    and mostinfamous; and is not the reason of this that no one 
                    has ever saidthe opposite, but every one from his earliest 
                    childhood has heardmen speaking in the same manner about them 
                    always and everywhere,whether in comedy or in the graver language 
                    of tragedy? When thepoet introduces on the stage a Thyestes 
                    or an Oedipus, or a Macareushaving secret intercourse with 
                    his sister, he represents him, whenfound out, ready to kill 
                    himself as the penalty of his sin.</p>
                  <p>Meg. You are very right in saying that tradition, if no breath 
                    ofopposition ever assails it, has a marvellous power.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Am I not also right in saying that the legislator who 
                    wantsto master any of the passions which master man may easily 
                    know howto subdue them? He will consecrate the tradition of 
                    their evilcharacter among all, slaves and freemen, women and 
                    children,throughout the city:-that will be the surest foundation 
                    of the lawwhich he can make.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Yes; but will he ever succeed in making all mankind 
                    use thesame language about them?</p>
                  <p>Ath. A good objection; but was I not just now saying that 
                    I had away to make men use natural love and abstain from unnatural, 
                    notintentionally destroying the seeds of human increase, or 
                    sowing themin stony places, in which they will take no root; 
                    and that I wouldcommand them to abstain too from any female 
                    field of increase in whichthat which is sown is not likely 
                    to grow? Now if a law to thiseffect could only be made perpetual, 
                    and gain an authority such asalready prevents intercourse 
                    of parents and children-such a law,extending to other sensual 
                    desires, and conquering them, would bethe source of ten thousand 
                    blessings. For, in the first place,moderation is the appointment 
                    of nature, and deters men from allfrenzy and madness of love, 
                    and from all adulteries and immoderate useof meats and drinks, 
                    and makes them good friends to their own wives.And innumerable 
                    other benefits would result if such a could only beenforced. 
                    I can imagine some lusty youth who is standing by, andwho, 
                    on hearing this enactment, declares in scurrilous terms that 
                    weare making foolish and impossible laws, and fills the world 
                    with hisoutcry. And therefore I said that I knew a way of 
                    enacting andperpetuating such a law, which was very easy in 
                    one respect, but inanother most difficult. There is no difficulty 
                    in seeing that such alaw is possible, and in what way; for, 
                    as I was saying, theordinance once consecrated would master 
                    the soul of, every man, andterrify him into obedience. But 
                    matters have now come to such a passthat even then the desired 
                    result seems as if it could not beattained, just as the continuance 
                    of an entire state in the practiceof common meals is also 
                    deemed impossible. And although this latter ispartly disproven 
                    by the fact of their existence among you, stilleven in your 
                    cities the common meals of women would be regarded asunnatural 
                    and impossible. I was thinking of the rebelliousness ofthe 
                    human heart when I said that the permanent establishment ofthese 
                    things is very difficult.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Shall I try and find some sort of persuasive argument 
                    whichwill prove to you that such enactments are possible, 
                    and not beyondhuman nature?</p>
                  <p>Cle. By all means.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Is a man more likely to abstain from the pleasures of 
                    loveand to do what he is bidden about them, when his body 
                    is in a goodcondition, or when he is in an ill condition, 
                    and out of training?</p>
                  <p>Cle. He will be far more temperate when he is in training.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And have we not heard of Iccus of Tarentum, who, with 
                    a view tothe Olympic and other contests, in his zeal for his 
                    art, ind alsobecause he was of a manly and temperate disposition, 
                    never had anyconnection with a woman or a youth during the 
                    whole time of histraining? And the same is said of Crison 
                    and Astylus and Diopompus andmany others; and yet, Cleinias, 
                    they were far worse educated intheir minds than your and my 
                    citizens, and in their bodies far morelusty.</p>
                  <p>Cle. No doubt this fact has been often affirmed positively 
                    by theancients of these athletes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And had they; courage to abstain from what is ordinarillydeemed 
                    a pleasure for the sake of a victory in wrestling, running, 
                    andthe like; and shall our young men be incapable of a similarendurance 
                    for the sake of a much nobler victory, which is thenoblest 
                    of all, as from their youth upwards we will tell them,charming 
                    them, as we hope, into the belief of this by tales andsayings 
                    and songs?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Of what victory are you speaking?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Of the victory over pleasure, which if they win, they 
                    will livehappily; or if they are conquered, the reverse of 
                    happily. And,further, may we not suppose that the fear of 
                    impiety will enablethem to master that which other inferior 
                    people have mastered?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I dare say.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And since we have reached this point in our legislation, 
                    andhave fallen into a difficulty by reason of the vices of 
                    mankind, Iaffirm that our ordinance should simply run in the 
                    following terms:Our citizens ought not to fall below the nature 
                    of birds and beasts ingeneral, who are born in great multitudes, 
                    and yet remain until theage for procreation virgin and unmarried, 
                    but when they have reachedthe proper time of life are coupled, 
                    male and female, and lovinglypair together, and live the rest 
                    of their lives in holiness andinnocence, abiding firmly in 
                    their original compact:-surely, we willsay to them, you should 
                    be better than the animals. But if they arecorrupted by the 
                    other Hellenes and the common practice of barbarians,and they 
                    see with their eyes and hear with their ears of the so-calledfree 
                    love everywhere prevailing among them, and they themselves 
                    arenot able to get the better of the temptation, the guardians 
                    of thelaw, exercising the functions of lawgivers, shall devise 
                    a secondlaw against them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. And what law would you advise them to pass if this one 
                    failed?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Clearly, Cleinias, the one which would naturally follow.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is that?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Our citizens should not allow pleasures to strengthen 
                    withindulgence, but should by toil divert the aliment and 
                    exuberance ofthem into other parts of the body; and this will 
                    happen if noimmodesty be allowed in the practice of love. 
                    Then they will beashamed of frequent intercourse, and they 
                    will find pleasure, ifseldom enjoyed, to be a less imperious 
                    mistress. They should not befound out doing anything of the 
                    sort. Concealment shall be honourable,and sanctioned by custom 
                    and made law by unwritten prescription; onthe other hand, 
                    to be detected shall be esteemed dishonourable, butnot, to 
                    abstain wholly. In this way there will be a second legalstandard 
                    of honourable and dishonourable, involving a second notion 
                    ofright. Three principles will comprehend all those corrupt 
                    natures whomwe call inferior to themselves, and who form but 
                    one dass, and willcompel them not to transgress.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What are they?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The principle of piety, the love of honour, and the 
                    desire ofbeauty, not in the body but in the soul. These are, 
                    perhaps,romantic aspirations; but they are the noblest of 
                    aspirations, if theycould only be realized in all states, 
                    and, God willing, in thematter of love we may be able to enforce 
                    one of two things-either thatno one shall venture to touch 
                    any person of the freeborn or nobleclass except his wedded 
                    wife, or sow the unconsecrated and bastardseed among harlots, 
                    or in barren and unnatural lusts; or at least wemay abolish 
                    altogether the connection of men with men; and as towomen, 
                    if any man has to do with any but those who come into his 
                    houseduly married by sacred rites, whether they be bought 
                    or acquired inany other way, and he offends publicly in the 
                    face of all mankind,we shall be right in enacting that he 
                    be deprived of civic honours andprivileges, and be deemed 
                    to be, as he truly is, a stranger. Letthis law, then, whether 
                    it is one, or ought rather to be called two,be laid down respecting 
                    love in general, and the intercourse of thesexes which arises 
                    out of the desires, whether rightly or wronglyindulged.</p>
                  <p> Meg. I, for my part, Stranger, would gladly receive this 
                    law.Cleinias shall speak for himself, and tell you what is 
                    his opinion.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I will, Megillus, when an opportunity offers; at present, 
                    Ithink that we had better allow the Stranger to proceed with 
                    his laws.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. We had got about as far as the establishment of the 
                    commontables, which in most places would be difficult, but 
                    in Crete no onewould think of introducing any other custom. 
                    There might arise aquestion about the manner of them-whether 
                    they shall be such as theyare here in Crete, or such as they 
                    are in Lacedaemon,-or is there athird kind which may be better 
                    than either of them? The answer to thisquestion might be easily 
                    discovered, but the discovery would do nogreat good, for at 
                    present they are very well ordered.</p>
                  <p>Leaving the common tables, we may therefore proceed to the 
                    meansof providing food. Now, in cities the means of life are 
                    gained in manyways and from divers sources, and in general 
                    from two sources, whereasour city has only one. For most of 
                    the Hellenes obtain their food fromsea and land, but our citizens 
                    from land only. And this makes the taskof the legislator less 
                    difficult-half as many laws will be enough, andmuch less than 
                    half; and they will be of a kind better suited tofree men. 
                    For he has nothing to do with laws about shipowners andmerchants 
                    and retailers and innkeepers and tax collectors and minesand 
                    moneylending and compound interest and innumerable otherthings-bidding 
                    good-bye to these, he gives laws to husbandmen andshepherds 
                    and bee-keepers, and to the guardians and superintendents 
                    oftheir implements; and he has already legislated for greater 
                    matters,as for example, respecting marriage and the procreation 
                    and nurture ofchildren, and for education, and the establishment 
                    of offices-andnow he must direct his laws to those who provide 
                    food and labour inpreparing it.</p>
                  <p>Let us first of all, then, have a class of laws which shall 
                    becalled the laws of husbandmen. And let the first of them 
                    be the law ofZeus, the god of boundaries. Let no one shift 
                    the boundary line eitherof a fellow-citizen who is a neighbour, 
                    or, if he dwells at theextremity of the land, of any stranger 
                    who is conterminous with him,considering that this is truly 
                    &quot;to move the immovable,&quot; and everyone should be 
                    more willing to move the largest rock which is not alandmark, 
                    than the least stone which is the sworn mark of friendshipand 
                    hatred between neighbours; for Zeus, the god of kindred, is 
                    thewitness of the citizen, and Zeus, the god of strangers, 
                    of thestranger, and when aroused, terrible are the wars which 
                    they stirup. He who obeys the law will never know the fatal 
                    consequences ofdisobedience, but he who despises the law shall 
                    be liable to adouble penalty, the first coming from the Gods, 
                    and the second fromthe law. For let no one wilfully remove 
                    the boundaries of hisneighbour's land, and if any one does, 
                    let him who will inform thelandowners, and let them bring 
                    him into court, and if he beconvicted of re-dividing the land 
                    by stealth or by force, let thecourt determine what he ought 
                    to suffer or pay. In the next place,many small injuries done 
                    by neighbours to one another, through theirmultiplication, 
                    may cause a weight of enmity, and make neighbourhood avery 
                    disagreeable and bitter thing. Wherefore a man ought to be 
                    verycareful of committing any offence against his neighbour, 
                    andespecially of encroaching on his neighbour's land; for 
                    any man mayeasily do harm, but not every man can do good to 
                    another. He whoencroaches on his neighbour's land, and transgresses 
                    his boundaries,shall make good the damage, and, to cure him 
                    of his impudence and alsoof his meanness, he shall pay a double 
                    penalty to the injured party.Of these and the like matters 
                    the wardens of the country shall takecognizance, and be the 
                    judges of them and assessors of the damage;in the more important 
                    cases, as has been already said, the wholenumber of them belonging 
                    to any one of the twelve divisions shalldecide, and in the 
                    lesser cases the commanders: or, again, if anyone pastures 
                    his cattle on his neighbour's land, they shall see theinjury, 
                    and adjudge the penalty. And if any one, by decoying the bees,gets 
                    possession of another's swarms, and draws them to himself 
                    bymaking noises, he shall pay the damage; or if anyone sets 
                    fire tohis own wood and takes no care of his neighbour's property, 
                    he shallbe fined at the discretion of the magistrates. And 
                    if in planting hedoes not leave a fair distance between his 
                    own and his neighbour'sland, he shall be punished, in accordance 
                    with the enactments ofmany law givers, which we may use, not 
                    deeming it necessary that thegreat legislator of our state 
                    should determine all the trifles whichmight be decided by 
                    any body; for example, husbandmen have had ofold excellent 
                    laws about waters, and there is no reason why weshould propose 
                    to divert their course: who likes may draw water fromthe fountain-head 
                    of the common stream on to his own land, if he donot cut off 
                    the spring which clearly belongs to some other owner;and he 
                    may take the water in any direction which he pleases, exceptthrough 
                    a house or temple or sepulchre, but he must be careful to 
                    dono harm beyond the channel. And if there be in any place 
                    a naturaldryness of the earth, which keeps in the rain from 
                    heaven, andcauses a deficiency in the supply of water, let 
                    him dig down on hisown land as far as the clay, and if at 
                    this depth he finds no water,let him obtain water from his 
                    neighbours, as much, as is requiredfor his servants' drinking, 
                    and if his neighbours, too, are limited intheir supply, let 
                    him have a fixed measure, which shall bedetermined by the 
                    wardens of the country. This he shall receive eachday, and 
                    on these terms have a share of his neighbours' water. Ifthere 
                    be heavy rain, and one of those on the lower ground injures 
                    sometiller of the upper ground, or some one who has a common 
                    wall, byrefusing to give the man outlet for water; or, again, 
                    if some oneliving on the higher ground recklessly lets off 
                    the water on his lowerneighbour, and they cannot come to terms 
                    with one another, let him whowill call in a warden of the 
                    city, if he be in the city, or if he bein the country, warden 
                    of the country, and let him obtain a decisiondetermining what 
                    each of them is to do. And he who will not abide bythe decision 
                    shall suffer for his malignant and morose temper, and paya 
                    fine to the injured party, equivalent to double the value 
                    of theinjury, because he was unwilling to submit to the magistrates.</p>
                  <p>Now the participation of fruits shall be ordered on this 
                    wise. Thegoddess of Autumn has two gracious gifts: one, the 
                    joy of Dionysuswhich is not treasured up; the other, which 
                    nature intends to bestored. Let this be the law, then, concerning 
                    the fruits of autumn: Hewho tastes the common or storing fruits 
                    of autumn, whether grapes orfigs, before the season of vintage 
                    which coincides with Arcturus,either on his own land or on 
                    that of others-let him pay fiftydrachmae, which shall be sacred 
                    to Dionysus, if he pluck them from hisown land; and if from 
                    his neighbour's land, a mina, and if from anyothers', two-thirds 
                    of a mina. And he who would gather the &quot;choice&quot;grapes 
                    or the &quot;choice&quot; figs, as they are now termed, if 
                    he take themoff his own land, let him pluck them how and when 
                    he likes; but ifhe take them from the ground of others without 
                    their leave, let him inthat case be always punished in accordance 
                    with the law whichordains that he should not move what he 
                    has not laid down. And if aslave touches any fruit of this 
                    sort, without the consent of the ownerof the land, he shall 
                    be beaten with as many blows as there are grapeson the bunch, 
                    or figs on the fig-tree. Let a metic purchase the&quot;choice&quot; 
                    autumnal fruit, and then, if he pleases, he may gather it;but 
                    if a stranger is passing along the road, and desires to eat, 
                    lethim take of the &quot;choice&quot; grapes for himself and 
                    a single followerwithout payment, as a tribute of hospitality. 
                    The law howeverforbids strangers from sharing in the sort 
                    which is not used foreating; and if any one, whether he be 
                    master or slave, takes of themin ignorance, let the slave 
                    be beaten, and the freeman dismissedwith admonitions, and 
                    instructed to take of the other autumnalfruits which are unfit 
                    for making raisins and wine, or for laying byas dried figs. 
                    As to pears, and apples, and pomegranates, andsimilar fruits, 
                    there shall be no disgrace in taking them secretly;but he 
                    who is caught, if he be of less than thirty years of age, 
                    shallbe struck and beaten off, but not wounded; and no freeman 
                    shall haveany right of satisfaction for such blows. Of these 
                    fruits the strangermay partake, just as he may of the fruits 
                    of autumn. And if anelder, who is more than thirty years of 
                    age, eat of them on thespot, let him, like the stranger, be 
                    allowed to partake of all suchfruits, but he must carry away 
                    nothing. If, however, he will notobey the law, let him run 
                    risk of failing in the competition ofvirtue, in case any one 
                    takes notice of his actions before thejudges at the time.</p>
                  <p>Water is the greatest element of nutrition in gardens, but 
                    is easilypolluted. You cannot poison the soil, or the soil, 
                    or the sun, orthe air, which are other elements of nutrition 
                    in plants, or divertthem, or steal them; but all these things 
                    may very likely happen inregard to water, which must therefore 
                    be protected by law. And letthis be the law:-If any one intentionally 
                    pollutes the water ofanother, whether the water of a spring, 
                    or collected in reservoirs,either by poisonous substances, 
                    or by digging or by theft, let theinjured party bring the 
                    cause before the wardens of the city, andclaim in writing 
                    the value of the loss; if the accused be found guiltyof injuring 
                    the water by deleterious substances, let him not onlypay damages, 
                    but purify the stream or the cistern which contains thewater, 
                    in such manner as the laws of the interpreters order thepurification 
                    to be made by the offender in each case.</p>
                  <p>With respect to the gathering in of the fruits of the soil, 
                    let aman, if he pleases, carry his own fruits through any 
                    place in which heeither does no harm to any one, or himself 
                    gains three times as muchas his neighbour loses. Now of these 
                    things the magistrates shouldbe cognisant, as of all other 
                    things in which a man intentionally doesinjury to another 
                    or to the property of another, by fraud or force, inthe use 
                    which he makes of his own property. All these matters a manshould 
                    lay before the magistrates, and receive damages, supposingthe 
                    injury to be not more than three minae; or if he have a chargeagainst 
                    another which involves a larger amount, let him bring his 
                    suitinto the public courts and have the evil-doer punished. 
                    But if anyof the magistrates appear to adjudge the penalties 
                    which he imposes inan unjust spirit, let him be liable to 
                    pay double to the injuredparty. Any one may bring the offences 
                    of magistrates, in anyparticular case, before the public courts. 
                    There are innumerablelittle matters relating to the modes 
                    of punishment, and applicationsfor suits, and summonses and 
                    the witnesses to summonses-for example,whether two witnesses 
                    should be required for a summons, or howmany-and all such 
                    details, which cannot be omitted in legislation, butare beneath 
                    the wisdom of an aged legislator. These lesser matters, asthey 
                    indeed are in comparison with the greater ones, let a youngergeneration 
                    regulate by law, after the patterns which have preceded,and 
                    according to their own experience of the usefulness andnecessity 
                    of such laws; and when they are duly regulated let therebe 
                    no alteration, but let the citizens live in the observance 
                    of them.</p>
                  <p>Now of artisans, let the regulations be as follows:-In the 
                    firstplace, let no citizen or servant of a citizen be occupied 
                    inhandicraft arts; for he who is to secure and preserve the 
                    public orderof the state, has an art which requires much study 
                    and many kinds ofknowledge, and does not admit of being made 
                    a secondary occupation;and hardly any human being is capable 
                    of pursuing two professions ortwo arts rightly, or of practising 
                    one art himself, and superintendingsome one else who is practising 
                    another. Let this, then, be ourfirst principle in the state:-No 
                    one who is a smith shall also be acarpenter, and if he be 
                    a carpenter, he shall not superintend thesmith's art rather 
                    than his own, under the pretext that insuperintending many 
                    servants who are working for him, he is likelyto superintend 
                    them better, because more revenue will accrue to himfrom them 
                    than from his own art; but let every man in the state haveone 
                    art, and get his living by that. Let the wardens of the citylabour 
                    to maintain this law, and if any citizen incline to any otherart 
                    than the study of virtue, let them punish him with disgrace 
                    andinfamy, until they bring him back into his own right course; 
                    and ifany stranger profess two arts, let them chastise him 
                    with bonds andmoney penalties, and expulsion from the state, 
                    until they compel himto be one only and not many.</p>
                  <p>But as touching payments for hire, and contracts of work, 
                    or in caseany one does wrong to any of the citizens or they 
                    do wrong to anyother, up to fifty drachmae, let the wardens 
                    of the city decide thecase; but if greater amount be involved, 
                    then let the public courtsdecide according to law. Let no 
                    one pay any duty either on theimportation or exportation of 
                    goods; and as to frankincense andsimilar perfumes, used in 
                    the service of the Gods, which come fromabroad, and purple 
                    and other dyes which are not produced in thecountry, or the 
                    materials of any art which have to be imported, andwhich are 
                    not necessary-no one should import them; nor again, shouldany 
                    one export anything which is wanted in the country. Of all 
                    thesethings let there be inspectors and superintendents, taken 
                    from theguardians of the law; and they shall be the twelve 
                    next in order tothe five seniors. Concerning arms, and all 
                    implements which are formilitary purposes, if there be need 
                    of introducing any art, orplant, or metal, or chains of any 
                    kind, or animals for use in war, letthe commanders of the 
                    horse and the generals have authority over theirimportation 
                    and exportation; the city shall send them out and alsoreceive 
                    them, and the guardians of the law shall make fit and properlaws 
                    about them. But let there be no retail trade for the sake 
                    ofmoney-making, either in these or any other articles, in 
                    the city orcountry at all.</p>
                  <p>With respect to food and the distribution of the produce 
                    of thecountry, the right and proper way seems to be nearly 
                    that which is thecustom of Crete; for all should be required 
                    to distribute the fruitsof the soil into twelve parts, and 
                    in this way consume them. Let thetwelfth portion of each (as 
                    for instance of wheat and barley, to whichthe rest of the 
                    fruits of the earth shall be added, as well as theanimals 
                    which are for sale in each of the twelve divisions) be dividedin 
                    due proportion into three parts; one part for freemen, anotherfor 
                    their servants, and a third for craftsmen and in general forstrangers, 
                    whether sojourners who may be dwelling in the city, andlike 
                    other men must live, or those who come on some business whichthey 
                    have with the state, or with some individual. Let only this 
                    thirdpart of all necessaries be required to be sold; out of 
                    the othertwo-thirds no one shall be compelled to sell. And 
                    how will they bebest distributed? In the first place, we see 
                    clearly that thedistribution will be of equals in one point 
                    of view, and in anotherpoint of view of unequals.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I mean that the earth of necessity produces and nourishes 
                    thevarious articles of food, sometimes better and sometimes 
                    worse.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Of course.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Such being the case, let no one of the three portions 
                    begreater than either of the other two-neither that which 
                    is assigned tomasters or to slaves, nor again that of the 
                    stranger; but let thedistribution to all be equal and alike, 
                    and let every citizen take histwo portions and distribute 
                    them among slaves and freemen, he havingpower to determine 
                    the quantity and quality. And what remains he shalldistribute 
                    by measure and numb among the animals who have to besustained 
                    from the earth, taking the whole number of them.</p>
                  <p>In the second place, our citizens should have separate houses 
                    dulyordered, and this will be the order proper for men like 
                    them. Thereshall be twelve hamlets, one in the middle of each 
                    twelfth portion,and in each hamlet they shall first set apart 
                    a market-place, andthe temples of the Gods, and of their attendant 
                    demigods; and if therebe any local deities of the Magnetes, 
                    or holy seats of other ancientdeities, whose memory has been 
                    preserved, to these let them paytheir ancient honours. But 
                    Hestia, and Zeus, and Athene will havetemples everywhere together 
                    with the God who presides in each of thetwelve districts. 
                    And the first erection of houses shall be aroundthese temples, 
                    where the ground is highest, in order to provide thesafest 
                    and most defensible place of retreat for the guards. All therest 
                    of the country they shall settle in the following manner:-Theyshall 
                    make thirteen divisions of the craftsmen; one of them they 
                    shallestablish in the city, and this, again, they shall subdivide 
                    intotwelve lesser divisions, among the twelve districts of 
                    the city, andthe remainder shall be distributed in the country 
                    round about; andin each village they shall settle various 
                    classes of craftsmen, with aview to the convenience of the 
                    husbandmen. And the chief officers ofthe wardens of the country 
                    shall superintend all these matters, andsee how many of them, 
                    and which class of them, each place requires;and fix them 
                    where they are likely to be least troublesome, and mostuseful 
                    to the husbandman. And the wardens of the city shall see tosimilar 
                    matters in the city.</p>
                  <p>Now the wardens of the agora ought to see to the details 
                    of theagora. Their first care, after the temples which are 
                    in the agora havebeen seen to, should be to prevent any one 
                    from doing any indealings between man and man; in the second; 
                    place, as beinginspectors of temperance and violence, they 
                    should chastise him whorequires chastisement. Touching articles 
                    of gale, they should firstsee whether the articles which the 
                    citizens are under regulations tosell to strangers are sold 
                    to them, as the law ordains. And let thelaw be as follows:-on 
                    the first day of the month, the persons incharge, whoever 
                    they are, whether strangers or slaves, who have thecharge 
                    on behalf of the citizens, shall produce to the strangers 
                    theportion which falls to them, in the first place, a twelfth 
                    portionof the corn;-the stranger shall purchase corn for the 
                    whole month, andother cereals, on the first market day; and 
                    on the tenth day of themonth the one party shall sell, and 
                    the other buy, liquidssufficient to last during the whole 
                    month; and on the twenty-third daythere shall be a sale of 
                    animals by those who are willing to sell tothe people who 
                    want to buy, and of implements and other things whichhusbandmen 
                    sell (such as skins and all kinds of clothing, either wovenor 
                    made of felt and other goods of the same sort), and which 
                    strangersare compelled to buy and purchase of others. As to 
                    the retail trade inthese things, whether of barley or wheat 
                    set apart for meal and flour,or any other kind of food, no 
                    one shall sell them to citizens or theirslaves, nor shall 
                    any one buy of a citizen; but let the strangersell them in 
                    the market of strangers, to artisans and their slaves,making 
                    an exchange of wine and food, which is commonly called retailtrade. 
                    And butchers shall offer for sale parts of dismemberedanimals 
                    to the strangers, and artisans, and their servants. Let anystranger 
                    who likes buy fuel from day to day wholesale, from thosewho 
                    have the care of it in the country, and let him sell to thestrangers 
                    as much he pleases and when he pleases. As to other goodsand 
                    implements which are likely to be wanted, they shall sell 
                    themin common market, at any place which the guardians of 
                    the law andthe wardens of the market and city, choosing according 
                    to theirjudgment, shall determine; at such places they shall 
                    exchange moneyfor goods, and goods for money, neither party 
                    giving credit to theother; and he who gives credit must be 
                    satisfied, whether he obtainhis money not, for in such exchanges 
                    he will not be protected bylaw. But whenever property has 
                    been bought or sold, greater inquantity or value than is allowed 
                    by the law, which has determinedwithin what limited a man 
                    may increase and diminish his possessions,let the excess be 
                    registered in the books of the guardians of the law;in case 
                    of diminution, let there be an erasure made. And let thesame 
                    rule be observed about the registration of the property of 
                    themetics. Any one who likes may come and be a metic on certainconditions; 
                    a foreigner, if he likes, and is able to settle, may dwellin 
                    the land, but he must practise an art, and not abide more 
                    thantwenty years from the time at which he has registered 
                    himself; andhe shall pay no sojourner's tax, however small, 
                    except good conduct,nor any other tax for buying and selling. 
                    But when the twenty yearshave expired, he shall take his property 
                    with him and depart. And ifin the course of these years he 
                    should chance to distinguish himselfby any considerable benefit 
                    which he confers on the state, and hethinks that he can persuade 
                    the council and assembly, either togrant him delay in leaving 
                    the country, or to allow him to remainfor the whole of his 
                    life, let him go and persuade the city, andwhatever they assent 
                    to at his instance shall take effect. For thechildren of the 
                    metics, being artisans, and of fifteen years of age,let the 
                    time of their sojourn commence after their fifteenth year; 
                    andlet them remain for twenty years, and then go where they 
                    like; but anyof them who wishes to remain, may do so, if he 
                    can persuade thecouncil and assembly. And if he depart, let 
                    him erase all theentries which have been made by him in the 
                    register kept by themagistrates.</p>

                    Str. Carding and spinning threads and all the parts of the 
                    process<br>
                    which are concerned with the actual manufacture of a woollen 
                    garment form a single art, which is one of thow universally 
                    acknowledged-the art of working in wool.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. To be sure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Of working in wool again, there are two divisions, and 
                    both<br>
                    these are parts of two arts at once.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How is that?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Carding and one half of the use of the comb, and the 
                    other<br>
                    processes of wool-working which separate the composite, may 
                    <br>
                    be classed together as belonging both to the art of woolworking, 
                    and also to one of the two great arts which are of universal 
                    application-the art of composition and the art of division.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. To the latter belong carding and the other processes 
                    <br>
                    of which I was just now speaking the art of discernment or 
                    division in wool and yarn, which is effected in one manner 
                    with the comb and in another with the hands, is variously 
                    described under all the names which I just now mentioned.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Again, let us take some process of woolworking which 
                    is also<br>
                    a portion of the art of composition, and, dismissing the elements 
                    of<br>
                    division which we found there, make two halves, one on the 
                    principle<br>
                    of composition, and the other on the principle of division.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Let that be done.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And once more, Socrates, we must divide the part which<br>
                    belongs at once both to woolworking and composition, if we 
                    <br>
                    are ever to discover satisfactorily the aforesaid art of weaving.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. We must.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes, certainly, and let us call one part of the art 
                    the art<br>
                    of twisting threads, the other the art of combining them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Do I understand you, in speaking of twisting, to 
                    be<br>
                    referring to manufacture of the warp?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes, and of the woof too; how, if not by twisting, is 
                    the<br>
                    woof made?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. There is no other way.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then suppose that you define the warp and the woof, 
                    <br>
                    for I think that the definition will be of use to you.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How shall I define them?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. As thus: A piece of carded wool which is drawn out lengthwise<br>
                    and breadth-wise is said to be pulled out.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the wool thus prepared when twisted by the spindle, 
                    and<br>
                    made into a firm thread, is called the warp, And the art which<br>
                    regulates these operations the art of spinning the warp.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the threads which are more loosely spun, having 
                    a<br>
                    softness proportioned to the intertexture of the warp and 
                    to the<br>
                    degree of force used in dressing the cloth-the threads which 
                    are<br>
                    thus spun are called the woof, and the art which is set over 
                    them<br>
                    may be called the art of spinning the woof.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And, now, there can be no mistake about the nature of 
                    the<br>
                    part of weaving which we have undertaken to define. For when 
                    <br>
                    that part of the art of composition which is employed in the 
                    working of wool forms a web by the regular intertexture of 
                    warp and woof, the entire woven substance is called by us 
                    a woollen garment, and the art which presides over this is 
                    the art of weaving.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But why did we not say at once that weaving is the art 
                    of<br>
                    entwining warp and woof, instead of making a long and <br>
                    useless circuit?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I thought, Stranger, that there was nothing useless 
                    in<br>
                    what was said.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Very likely, but you may not always think so, my sweet<br>
                    friend; and in case any feeling of dissatisfaction should 
                    hereafter<br>
                    arise in your mind, as it very well may, let me lay down a 
                    principle<br>
                    which will apply to arguments in general.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Proceed.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us begin by considering the whole nature of excess 
                    and<br>
                    defect, and then we shall have a rational ground on which 
                    we may<br>
                    praise or blame too much length or too much shortness in discussions 
                    of this kind.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Let us do so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The points on which I think that we ought to dwell are 
                    the<br>
                    following:-<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Length and shortness, excess and defect; with all of 
                    <br>
                    these the art of measurement is conversant.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the art of measurement has to be divided into two 
                    parts,<br>
                    with a view to our present purpose.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Where would you make the division?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. As thus: I would make two parts, one having regard to 
                    the<br>
                    relativity of greatness and smallness to each other; and there 
                    is<br>
                    another, without which the existence of production would be<br>
                    impossible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Do you not think that it is only natural for the greater 
                    to<br>
                    be called greater with reference to the less alone, and the 
                    less<br>
                    reference to the greater alone?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Well, but is there not also something exceeding and 
                    <br>
                    exceeded by the principle of the mean, both in speech and 
                    action, and is not this a reality, and the chief mark of difference 
                    between good and bad men?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Plainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then we must suppose that the great and small exist 
                    and are<br>
                    discerned in both these ways, and not, as we were saying before,<br>
                    only relatively to one another, but there must also be another<br>
                    comparison of them with the mean or ideal standard; would 
                    you like<br>
                    to hear the reason why?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. If we assume the greater to exist only in relation to 
                    <br>
                    the less, there will never be any comparison of either with 
                    the mean.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And would not this doctrine be the ruin of all the arts 
                    and<br>
                    their creations; would not the art of the Statesman and the<br>
                    aforesaid art of weaving disappear? For all these arts are 
                    on the<br>
                    watch against excess and defect, not as unrealities, but as 
                    real<br>
                    evils, which occasion a difficulty in action; and the excellence 
                    of<br>
                    beauty of every work of art is due to this observance of measure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But if the science of the Statesman disappears, the 
                    search<br>
                    for the royal science will be impossible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Well, then, as in the case of the Sophist we extorted 
                    the<br>
                    inference that not-being had an existence, because here was 
                    the<br>
                    point at which the argument eluded our grasp, so in this we 
                    must<br>
                    endeavour to show that the greater and, less are not only 
                    to be<br>
                    measured with one another, but also have to do with the production<br>
                    of the mean; for if this is not admitted, neither a statesman 
                    nor<br>
                    any other man of action can be an undisputed master of his 
                    science.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes, we must certainly do again what we did then.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But this, Socrates, is a greater work than the other, 
                    of<br>
                    which we only too well remember the length. I think, however, 
                    that<br>
                    we may fairly assume something of this sort-<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. That we shall some day require this notion of a mean 
                    with a<br>
                    view to the demonstration of absolute truth; meanwhile, the 
                    argument<br>
                    that the very existence of the arts must be held to depend 
                    on the<br>
                    possibility of measuring more or less, not only with one another,<br>
                    but also with a view to the attainment of the mean, seems 
                    to afford<br>
                    a grand support and satisfactory proof of the doctrine which 
                    we are<br>
                    maintaining; for if there are arts, there is a standard of 
                    measure,<br>
                    and if there is a standard of measure, there are arts; but 
                    if either<br>
                    is wanting, there is neither.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True; and what is the next step?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The next step clearly is to divide the art of measurement<br>
                    into two parts, all we have said already, and to place in 
                    <br>
                    the one part all the arts which measure number, length, depth, 
                    breadth, swiftness with their opposites; and to have another 
                    part in which they are measured with the mean, and the fit, 
                    and the opportune, and the due, and with all those words, 
                    in short, which denote a mean or standard removed from the 
                    extremes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Here are two vast divisions, embracing two very different<br>
                    spheres.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There are many accomplished men, Socrates, who say, 
                    believing<br>
                    themselves to speak wisely, that the art of measurement is<br>
                    universal, and has to do with all things. And this means what 
                    we are<br>
                    now saying; for all things which come within the province 
                    of art do<br>
                    certainly in some sense partake of measure. But these <br>
                    persons, because they are not accustomed to distinguish classes 
                    according to real forms, jumble together two widely different 
                    things, relation to one another, and to a standard, under 
                    the idea that they are the same, and also fall into the converse 
                    error of dividing other things not according to their real 
                    parts. Whereas the right way is, if a man<br>
                    has first seen the unity of things, to go on with the enquiry 
                    and<br>
                    not desist until he has found all the differences contained 
                    in it<br>
                    which form distinct classes; nor again should he be able to 
                    rest<br>
                    contented with the manifold diversities which are seen in 
                    a<br>
                    multitude of things until he has comprehended all of them 
                    that have<br>
                    any affinity within the bounds of one similarity and embraced 
                    them<br>
                    within the reality of a single kind. But we have said enough 
                    on this<br>
                    head, and also of excess and defect; we have only to bear 
                    in <br>
                    mind that two divisions of the art of measurement have been 
                    discovered which are concerned with them, and not forget what 
                    they are.</p>
                  <p> Y. Soc. We will not forget.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And now that this discussion is completed, let us go 
                    on to<br>
                    consider another question, which concerns not this argument 
                    only but<br>
                    the conduct of such arguments in general.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What is this new question?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Take the case of a child who is engaged in learning 
                    his<br>
                    letters: when he is asked what letters make up a word, should 
                    we say<br>
                    that the question is intended to improve his grammatical knowledge<br>
                    of that particular word, or of all words?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Clearly, in order that he may have a better <br>
                    knowledge of all words.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And is our enquiry about the Statesman intended only 
                    <br>
                    to improve our knowledge of politics, or our power of reasoning 
                    generally?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Clearly, as in the former example, the purpose is 
                    general.<br>
                    Str. Still less would any rational man seek to analyse the 
                    <br>
                    notion of weaving for its own sake. But people seem to forget 
                    that some things have sensible images, which are readily known, 
                    and can be easily pointed out when any one desires to answer 
                    an enquirer without any trouble or argument; whereas the greatest 
                    and highest truths have no outward image of themselves visible 
                    to man, which he who wishes to satisfy the soul of the enquirer 
                    can adapt to the eye of sense, and therefore we ought to train 
                    ourselves to give and accept a rational account of them; for 
                    immaterial things, which are the noblest and greatest, are 
                    shown only in thought and idea, and in no <br>
                    other way, and all that we are now saying is said for the 
                    sake of them. Moreover, there is always less difficulty in 
                    fixing the mind on small matters than on great.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us call to mind the bearing of all this.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What is it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I wanted to get rid of any impression of tediousness 
                    which we<br>
                    may have experienced in the discussion about weaving, and 
                    <br>
                    the reversal of the universe, and in the discussion concerning 
                    the Sophist and the being of not-being. I know that they were 
                    felt to be too long, and I reproached myself with this, fearing 
                    that they might be not only tedious but irrelevant; and all 
                    that I have now said is only<br>
                    designed to prevent the recurrence of any such disagreeables 
                    for the<br>
                    future.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very good. Will you proceed?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then I would like to observe that you and I, remembering 
                    what<br>
                    has been said, should praise or blame the length or shortness 
                    of<br>
                    discussions, not by comparing them with one another, but with 
                    what<br>
                    is fitting, having regard to the part of measurement, which, 
                    as we<br>
                    said, was to be borne in mind.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And yet, not everything is to be judged even with a 
                    view to<br>
                    what is fitting; for we should only want such a length as 
                    is <br>
                    suited to give pleasure, if at all, as a secondary matter; 
                    and reason tells us, that we should be contented to make the 
                    ease or rapidity of an enquiry, not our first, but our second 
                    object; the first and highest<br>
                    of all being to assert the great method of division according 
                    to<br>
                    species-whether the discourse be shorter or longer is not 
                    to the<br>
                    point. No offence should be taken at length, but the longer 
                    and<br>
                    shorter are to be employed indifferently, according as either 
                    of<br>
                    them is better calculated to sharpen the wits of the auditors.<br>
                    Reason would also say to him who censures the length of discourses<br>
                    on such occasions and cannot away with their circumlocution, 
                    that he<br>
                    should not be in such a hurry to have done with them, when 
                    <br>
                    he can only complain that they are tedious, but he should 
                    prove that if they had been shorter they would have made those 
                    who took part in them better dialecticians, and more capable 
                    of expressing the truth of things; about any other praise 
                    and blame, he need not trouble himself-he should pretend not 
                    to hear them. But we have had enough of this, as you will 
                    probably agree with me in thinking. Let us return to our<br>
                    Statesman, and apply to his case the aforesaid example of 
                    weaving.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very good;-let us do as you say.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The art of the king has been separated from the similar 
                    arts of<br>
                    shepherds, and, indeed, from all those which have to do with 
                    herds<br>
                    at all. There still remain, however, of the causal and co-operative<br>
                    arts those which are immediately concerned with States, and 
                    <br>
                    which must first be distinguished from one another.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You know that these arts cannot easily be divided into 
                    two<br>
                    halves; the reason will be very: evident as we proceed.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Then we had better do so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. We must carve them like a victim into members or limbs, 
                    since<br>
                    we cannot bisect them. For we certainly should divide everything<br>
                    into as few parts as possible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What is to be done in this case?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. What we did in the example of weaving-all those arts 
                    which<br>
                    furnish the tools were regarded by us as co-operative.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. So now, and with still more reason, all arts which make 
                    any<br>
                    implement in a State, whether great or small, may be <br>
                    regarded by us as co-operative, for without them neither State 
                    nor Statesmanship would be possible; and yet we are not inclined 
                    to say that any of them is a product of the kingly art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. No, indeed.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The task of separating this class from others is not 
                    an easy<br>
                    one; for there is plausibility in saying that anything in 
                    <br>
                    the world is the instrument of doing something. But there 
                    is another dass of possessions in, a city, of which I have 
                    a word to say.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What class do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. A class which may be described as not having this power; 
                    that<br>
                    is to say, not like an instrument, framed for production, 
                    <br>
                    but designed for the preservation of that which is produced.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. To what do you refer?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. To the class of vessels, as they are comprehensively 
                    termed,<br>
                    which are constructed for the preservation of things moist 
                    <br>
                    and dry, of things prepared in the fire or out of the fire; 
                    this is a very large class, and has, if I am not mistaken, 
                    literally nothing to <br>
                    do with the royal art of which we are in search.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is also a third class of possessions to be noted,<br>
                    different from these and very extensive, moving or resting 
                    on land<br>
                    or water, honourable and also dishonourable. The whole of 
                    this class<br>
                    has one name, because it is intended to be sat upon, being 
                    always a<br>
                    seat for something.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What is it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. A vehicle, which is certainly not the work of the Statesman,<br>
                    but of the carpenter, potter, and coppersmith.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I understand.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And is there not a fourth class which is again different, 
                    and<br>
                    in which most of the things formerly mentioned are contained-every<br>
                    kind of dress, most sorts of arms, walls and enclosures, whether 
                    of<br>
                    earth or stone, and ten thousand other thing? all of which 
                    being<br>
                    made for the sake of defence, may be truly called defences, 
                    and are<br>
                    for the most part to be regarded as the work of the builder 
                    or of<br>
                    the weaver, rather than of the Statesman.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Shall we add a fifth class, of ornamentation and drawing, 
                    and<br>
                    of the imitations produced, by drawing and music, which are 
                    designed for amusement only, and may be fairly comprehended 
                    under one name?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What is it?<br>

                    for<br>
                    none of these things have a serious purpose-amusement is their

                    these,<br>
                    out of which and in which the arts already mentioned fabricate 
                    their<br>
                    works;-this manifold class, I say, which is the creation and 
                    <br>
                    offspring of many other arts, may I not rank sixth?<br>

                  <p>Str. I am referring to gold, silver, and other metals, and 
                    all<br>
                    that wood-cutting and shearing of every sort provides for 
                    the art of<br>
                    carpentry and plaiting; and there is the process of barking 
                    and<br>
                    stripping the cuticle of plants, and the currier's art, which 
                    strips<br>
                    off the skins of animals, and other similar arts which manufacture<br>
                    corks and papyri and cords, and provide for the manufacture 
                    of<br>
                    composite species out of simple kinds-the whole class may 
                    be termed<br>
                    the primitive and simple possession of man, and with this 
                    the kingly<br>

                  <p>Str. The provision of food and of all other things which 
                    mingle<br>
                    their particles with the particles of the human body; and 
                    minister<br>
                    to the body, will form a seventh class, which may be called 
                    by the<br>
                    general term of nourishment, unless you have any better name 
                    <br>
                    to offer.This, however, appertains rather to the husbandman, 
                    <br>
                    huntsman, trainer, doctor, cook, and is not to be assigned 
                    to the Statesman's art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. These seven classes include nearly every description 
                    of<br>
                    property, with the exception of tame animals. Consider;-there 
                    was<br>
                    the original material, which ought to have been placed first; 
                    next<br>
                    come instruments, vessels, vehicles, defences, playthings,<br>
                    nourishment; small things, which may be-included under one 
                    <br>
                    of these-as for example, coins, seals and stamps, are omitted, 
                    for they have not in them the character of any larger kind 
                    which includes <br>
                    them; but some of them may, with a little forcing, be placed 
                    among ornaments, and others may be made to harmonize with 
                    the class of implements. The art of herding, which has been 
                    already divided into parts, will include all property in tame 
                    animals except slaves.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The class of slaves and ministers only remains, and 
                    I suspect<br>
                    that in this the real aspirants for the throne, who are the 
                    rivals<br>
                    of the king in the formation of the political web, will be 
                    <br>
                    discovered; just as spinners, carders, and the rest of them, 
                    were the rivals of the weaver. All the others, who were termed 
                    co-operators, have been got rid of among the occupations already 
                    mentioned, and <br>
                    separated from the royal and political science.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I agree.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us go a little nearer, in order that we may be <br>
                    more certain of the complexion of this remaining class.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Let us do so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. We shall find from our present point of view that the<br>
                    greatest servants are in a case and condition which is the 
                    reverse<br>
                    of what we anticipated.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Who are they?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Those who have been purchased, and have so become<br>
                    possessions; these are unmistakably slaves, and certainly 
                    do <br>
                    not claim royal science.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Again, freemen who of their own accord become the servants 
                    of<br>
                    the other classes in a State, and who exchange and equalise 
                    the<br>
                    products of husbandry and the other arts, some sitting in 
                    the<br>
                    market-place, others going from city to city by land or sea, 
                    and<br>
                    giving money in exchange for money or for other productions-the<br>
                    money-changer, the merchant, the ship-owner, the retailer, 
                    will not<br>
                    put in any claim to statecraft or politics?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. No; unless, indeed, to the politics of commerce.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But surely men whom we see acting as hirelings and serfs, 
                    and<br>
                    too happy to turn their hand to anything, will not profess 
                    <br>
                    to share in royal science?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But what would you say of some other serviceable officials?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Who are they, and what services do they perform?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There are heralds, and scribes perfected by practice, 
                    and<br>
                    divers others who have great skill in various sorts of business<br>
                    connected with the government of states-what shall we call 
                    them?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. They are the officials, and servants of the rulers, 
                    as you<br>
                    just now called them, but not themselves rulers.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There may be something strange in any servant pretending 
                    to<br>
                    be a ruler, and yet I do not think that I could have been 
                    dreaming<br>
                    when I imagined that the principal claimants to political 
                    science<br>
                    would be found somewhere in this neighbourhood.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Well, let us draw nearer, and try the claims of some 
                    who have<br>
                    not yet been tested; in the first place, there are diviners, 
                    who<br>
                    have a portion of servile or ministerial science, and are 
                    thought to<br>
                    be the interpreters of the gods to men.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is also the priestly class, who, as the law declares,<br>
                    know how to give the gods gifts from men in the form of sacrifices<br>
                    which are acceptable to them, and to ask on our behalf blessings 
                    in<br>
                    return from them. Now both these are branches of the servile 
                    or<br>
                    ministerial art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes, clearly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And here I think that we seem to be getting on the <br>
                    right track; for the priest and the diviner are swollen with 
                    pride and <br>
                    prerogative and they create an awful impression of themselves 
                    by the magnitude of their enterprises; in Egypt, the king 
                    himself is not allowed to reign, unless he have priestly powers, 
                    and if he should be of another class and has thrust himself 
                    in, he must get enrolled in the<br>
                    priesthood. In many parts of Hellas, the duty of offering 
                    the most<br>
                    solemn propitiatory sacrifices is assigned to the highest<br>
                    magistracies, and here, at Athens, the most solemn and <br>
                    national of the ancient sacrifices are supposed to be celebrated 
                    by him who has been chosen by lot to be the King Archon.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Precisely.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But who are these other kings and priests elected by 
                    lot who<br>
                    now come into view followed by their retainers and a vast 
                    throng, as<br>
                    the former class disappears and the scene changes?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Whom can you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. They are a strange crew.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Why strange?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. A minute ago I thought that they were animals of every 
                    tribe;<br>
                    for many of them are like lions and centaurs, and many more 
                    like<br>
                    satyrs and such weak and shifty creatures;-Protean shapes 
                    quickly<br>
                    changing into one another's forms and natures; and now, Socrates, 
                    I<br>
                    begin to see who they are.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Who are they? You seem to be gazing on some strange 
                    vision.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes; every one looks strange when you do not know <br>
                    him; and just now I myself fell into this mistake-at first 
                    sight, coming suddenly upon him, I did not recognize the politician 
                    and his troop.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Who is he?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The chief of Sophists and most accomplished of wizards, 
                    who<br>
                    must at any cost be separated from the true king or Statesman, 
                    if we<br>
                    are ever to see daylight in the present enquiry.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. That is a hope not lightly to be renounced.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Never, if I can help it; and, first, let me ask you 
                    a <br>
                    question.<br>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Is not monarchy a recognized form of government?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And, after monarchy, next in order comes the government 
                    of<br>
                    the few?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Of course.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Is not the third form of government the rule of the<br>
                    multitude, which is called by the name of democracy?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And do not these three expand in a manner into five,<br>
                    producing out of themselves two other names Y. Soc. What are 
                    they?<br>

                  <p>Y. Soc. What are they?<br>
                  </p>

                    and riches, law and the absence of law, which men now-a-days 
                    apply<br>
                    to them; the two first they subdivide accordingly, and ascribe 
                    to<br>
                    monarchy two forms and two corresponding names, royalty and 
                    tyranny.<br>

                    <br>
                    or not, and whether the multitude rule over the men of property 
                    with <br>
                    their consent or against their consent, always in ordinary 
                    language has the same name.<br>

                    is defined by these characteristics of the one, the few, or 
                    the many, of<br>
                    poverty or wealth, of voluntary or compulsory submission, 
                    of written<br>
                    law or the absence of law, can be a right one?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Why not?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Reflect; and follow me.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. In what direction?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Shall we abide by what we said at first, or shall we 
                    retract<br>
                    our words?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. To what do you refer?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. If I am not mistaken, we said that royal power was a 
                    science?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And a science of a peculiar kind, which was selected 
                    <br>
                    out of the rest as having a character which is at once judicial 
                    and<br>
                    authoritative?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And there was one kind of authority over lifeless things 
                    and<br>
                    another other living animals; and so we proceeded in the <br>
                    division step by step up to this point, not losing the idea 
                    of science, but unable as yet to determine the nature of the 
                    particular science?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Hence we are led to observe that the distinguishing 
                    principle<br>
                    of the State cannot be the few or many, the voluntary or<br>
                    involuntary, poverty or riches; but some notion of science 
                    must<br>
                    enter into it, if we are to be consistent with what has preceded.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. And we must be consistent.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Well, then, in which of these various forms of States 
                    may the<br>
                    science of government, which is among the greatest of all 
                    <br>
                    sciences and most difficult to acquire, be supposed to reside? 
                    That we must discover, and then we shall see who are the false 
                    politicians who pretend to be politicians but are not, although 
                    they persuade many, and shall separate them from the wise 
                    king.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. That, as the argument has already intimated, will 
                    be our<br>
                    duty.</p>
                  <p> Str. Do you think that the multitude in a State can attain 
                    <br>
                    politicalS science?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Impossible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But, perhaps, in a city of a thousand men, there would 
                    be a<br>
                    hundred, or say fifty, who could?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. In that case political science would certainly be 
                    the<br>
                    easiest of all sciences; there could not be found in a city 
                    of that<br>
                    number as many really first-rate draught-players, if judged 
                    by the<br>
                    standard of the rest of Hellas, and there would certainly 
                    not be as<br>
                    many kings. For kings we may truly call those who possess 
                    royal<br>
                    science, whether they rule or not, as was shown in the previous<br>
                    argument.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Thank you for reminding me; and the consequence is that 
                    any<br>
                    true form of government can only be supposed to be the government 
                    of one, two, or, at any rate, of a few.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And these, whether they rule with the will, or <br>
                    against the will of their subjects, with written laws or. 
                    without written laws, and whether they are poor or rich, and 
                    whatever be the nature of their rule, must be supposed, according 
                    to our present view, to <br>
                    rule on some scientific principle; just as the physician, 
                    whether he cures us against our will or with our will, and 
                    whatever be his mode of<br>
                    treatment-incision, burning, or the infliction of some other<br>
                    pain-whether he practises out of a book or not out of a book, 
                    and<br>
                    whether he be rich or poor, whether he purges or reduces in 
                    <br>
                    some other way, or even fattens his patients, is a physician 
                    all the same, so long as he exercises authority over them 
                    according to rules <br>
                    of art, if he only does them good and heals and saves them. 
                    And this we lay down to be the only proper test of the art 
                    of medicine, or of any other art of command.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then that can be the only true form of government in 
                    which<br>
                    the governors are really found to possess science, and are 
                    not mere<br>
                    pretenders, whether they rule according to law or without 
                    law,<br>
                    over-willing or unwilling subjects, and are rich or poor<br>
                    themselves-none of these things can with any propriety be 
                    included<br>
                    in the notion of the ruler.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And whether with a view to the public good they purge 
                    <br>
                    the State by killing some, or exiling some; whether they reduce 
                    the size of the body corporate by sending out from the hive 
                    swarms of citizens, or, by introducing persons from without, 
                    increase it; while they act according to the rules of wisdom 
                    and justice, and use their <br>
                    power with a view to the general security and improvement, 
                    the city over which they rule, and which has these characteristics, 
                    may be described as the only true State. All other governments 
                    are not genuine or real; but only imitations of this, and 
                    some of them are better and some of them are worse; the better 
                    are said to be well governed, but they are mere imitations 
                    like the others.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I agree, Stranger, in the greater part of what you 
                    say;<br>
                    but as to their ruling without laws-the expression has a harsh 
                    sound.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You have been too quick for me, Socrates; I was just 
                    going to<br>
                    ask you whether you objected to any of my statements. And 
                    now I see that we shall have to consider this notion of there 
                    being good<br>
                    government without laws.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There can be no doubt that legislation is in a manner 
                    the<br>
                    business of a king, and yet the best thing of all is not that 
                    the<br>
                    law should rule, but that a man should rule, supposing him 
                    to have<br>
                    wisdom and royal power. Do you see why this is?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Why?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Because the law does not perfectly comprehend what is 
                    noblest<br>
                    and most just for all and therefore cannot enforce what is 
                    best. The<br>
                    differences of men and actions, and the endless irregular 
                    <br>
                    movements of human things, do not admit of -any universal 
                    and simple rule. And no art whatsoever can lay down a rule 
                    which will last for all time.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Of course not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But the law is always striving to make one;-like an 
                    obstinate<br>
                    and ignorant tyrant, who will not allow anything to be done 
                    contrary<br>
                    to his appointment, or any question to be asked-not even in 
                    sudden<br>
                    changes of circumstances, when something happens to be better 
                    than<br>
                    what he commanded for some one.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly; the law treats us all precisely in the 
                    manner<br>
                    which you describe.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. A perfectly simple principle can never be applied to 
                    <br>
                    a state of things which is the reverse of simple.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then if the law is not the perfection of right, why 
                    are we<br>
                    compelled to make laws at all? The reason of this has next 
                    to be<br>
                    investigated.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let me ask, whether you have not meetings for gymnastic<br>
                    contests in your city, such as there are in other cities, 
                    at <br>
                    which men compete in running, wrestling, and the like?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes; they are very common among us.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And what are the rules which are enforced on their pupils 
                    by<br>
                    professional trainers or by others having similar authority? 
                    Can you<br>
                    remember?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. To what do you refer?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The training-masters do not issue minute rules for <br>
                    individuals, or give every individual what is exactly suited 
                    to his constitution; they think that they ought to go more 
                    roughly to work, and to prescribe generally the regimen, which 
                    will benefit the majority.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And therefore they assign equal amounts of exercise 
                    to them<br>
                    all; they send them forth together, and let them rest together 
                    from<br>
                    their running, wrestling, or whatever the form of bodily exercise<br>
                    may be.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. So True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And now observe that the legislator who has to <br>
                    preside over the herd, and to enforce justice in their dealings 
                    with one another, will not be able, in enacting for the general 
                    good, to <br>
                    provide exactly what is suitable for each particular case.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. He cannot be expected to do so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. He will lay down laws in a general form for the majority,<br>
                    roughly meeting the cases of individuals; and some of them 
                    he will<br>
                    deliver in writing, and others will be unwritten; and these 
                    last<br>
                    will be traditional customs of the country.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. He will be right.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes, quite right; for how can he sit at every man's 
                    side all<br>
                    through his life, prescribing for him the exact particulars 
                    of his<br>
                    duty? Who, Socrates, would be equal to such a task? No one 
                    who<br>
                    really had the royal science, if he had been able to do this, 
                    would<br>
                    have imposed upon himself the restriction of a written law.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. So I should infer from what has now been said.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Or rather, my good friend, from what is going to be 
                    said.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. And what is that?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us put to ourselves the case of a physician, or 
                    trainer,<br>
                    who is about to go into a far country, and is expecting to 
                    be a long<br>
                    time away from his patients-thinking that his instructions 
                    <br>
                    will not be remembered unless they are written down, he will 
                    leave notes of them for the use of his pupils or patients.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But what would you say, if he came back sooner than 
                    he had<br>
                    intended, and, owing to an unexpected change of the winds 
                    or other<br>
                    celestial influences, something else happened to be better 
                    for<br>
                    them-would he not venture to suggest this new remedy, although 
                    not<br>
                    contemplated in his former prescription? Would he persist 
                    in <br>
                    observing the original law, neither himself giving any few 
                    <br>
                    commandments, nor the patient daring to do otherwise than 
                    was prescribed, under the idea that this course only was healthy 
                    and medicinal, all others noxious and heterodox? Viewed in 
                    the light of science and true art, would not all such enactments 
                    be utterly ridiculous?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Utterly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And if he who gave laws, written or unwritten, <br>
                    determining what was good or bad, honourable or dishonourable, 
                    just or unjust, to the tribes of men who flock together in 
                    their several cities, and are governed accordance with them; 
                    if, I say, the wise legislator were suddenly to come again, 
                    or another like to him, is he to be prohibited from changing 
                    them?-would not this prohibition be in reality quite as ridiculous 
                    as the other?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Do you know a plausible saying of the common people 
                    <br>
                    which is in point?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I do not recall what you mean at the moment.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. They say that if any one knows how the ancient laws 
                    may be<br>
                    improved, he must first persuade his own State of the <br>
                    improvement, and then he may legislate, but not otherwise.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. And are they not right?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I dare say. But supposing that he does use some <br>
                    gentle violence for their good, what is this violence to be 
                    called? Or rather,<br>
                    before you answer, let me ask the same question in reference 
                    to our<br>
                    previous instances.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Suppose that a skilful physician has a patient, of <br>
                    whatever sex or age, whom he compels against his will to do 
                    something for his good which is contrary to the written rules; 
                    what is this compulsion to be called? Would you ever dream 
                    of calling it a violation of the art, or a breach of the laws 
                    of health? Nothing could be more unjust than for the patient 
                    to whom such violence is applied, to charge the physician 
                    who practises the violence with wanting skill or aggravating 
                    his disease.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Most true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. In the political art error is not called disease, but 
                    evil,<br>
                    or disgrace, or injustice.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And when the citizen, contrary to law and custom, is<br>
                    compelled to do what is juster and better and nobler than 
                    he did<br>
                    before, the last and most absurd thing which he could say 
                    about such<br>
                    violence is that he has incurred disgrace or evil or injustice 
                    at<br>
                    the hands of those who compelled him.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And shall we say that the violence, if exercised by 
                    a <br>
                    rich man,is just, and if by a poor man, unjust? May not any 
                    man, rich or poor, with or without laws, with the will of 
                    the citizens or against<br>
                    the will of the citizens, do what is for their interest? Is 
                    not this<br>
                    the true principle of government, according to which the <br>
                    wise and good man will order the affairs of his subjects? 
                    As the pilot, by watching continually over the interests of 
                    the ship and of the<br>
                    crew-not by laying down rules, but by making his art a law-preserves<br>
                    the lives of his fellow-sailors, even and in the self-same 
                    way, may<br>
                    there not be a true form of polity created by those who are 
                    able to<br>
                    govern in a similar spirit, and who show a strength of art 
                    which is<br>
                    superior to the law? Nor can wise rulers ever err while they,<br>
                    observing the one great rule of distributing justice to the 
                    citizens<br>
                    with intelligence and skill, are able to preserve them, and, 
                    <br>
                    as far as may be, to make them better from being worse.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. No one can deny what has been now said.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Neither, if you consider, can any one deny the other 
                    <br>
                    statement.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What was it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. We said that no great number of persons, whoever they 
                    may be,<br>
                    can attain political knowledge, or order a State wisely, but 
                    that<br>
                    the true government is to be found in a small body, or in 
                    an<br>
                    individual, and that other States are but imitations of this, 
                    as we<br>
                    said a little while ago, some for the better and some for 
                    the worse.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What do you mean? I cannot have understood your previous<br>
                    remark about imitations.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And yet the mere suggestion which I hastily threw out 
                    <br>
                    is highly important, even if we leave the question where it 
                    is, and do not seek by the discussion of it to expose the 
                    error which prevails in<br>
                    this matter.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The idea which has to be grasped by us is not easy or 
                    <br>
                    familiar; but we may attempt to express it thus:-Supposing 
                    the government of which I have been speaking to be the only 
                    true model, then the others must use the written laws of this-in 
                    no other can they be saved; they will have to do what is now 
                    generally approved, although not the best thing in the world.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What is this?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. No citizen should do anything contrary to the laws, 
                    and any<br>
                    infringement of them should be punished with death and the 
                    most<br>
                    extreme penalties; and this is very right and good when regarded 
                    as<br>
                    the second best thing, if you set aside the first, of which 
                    <br>
                    I was just now speaking. Shall I explain the nature of what 
                    call the <br>
                    second best?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. By all means.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I must again have recourse to my favourite images; through<br>
                    them, and them alone, can I describe kings and rulers.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What images?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The noble pilot and the wise physician, who &quot;is 
                    worth many<br>
                    another man&quot;-in the similitude of these let us endeavour 
                    to discover<br>
                    some image of the king.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What sort of image?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Well, such as this:-Every man will reflect that he suffers<br>
                    strange things at the hands of both of them; the physician; 
                    saves<br>
                    any whom he wishes to save, and any whom he wishes to maltreat 
                    he<br>
                    maltreats-cutting or burning them; and at the same time <br>
                    requiring themS to bring him patients, which are a sort of 
                    tribute, of which little or nothing is spent upon the sick 
                    man, and the greater part is consumed by him and his domestics; 
                    and the finale is that he receives money from the relations 
                    of the sick man or from some enemy of his; and puts him out 
                    of the way. And the pilots of ships are guilty, of numberless 
                    evil deeds of the same kind; they intentionally play false 
                    and leave you ashore when the hour of sailing arrives; or 
                    they cause mishaps at sea and cast away their freight; and 
                    are guilty of<br>
                    other rogueries. Now suppose that we, bearing all this in 
                    mind, were<br>
                    to determine, after consideration, that neither of these arts 
                    shall<br>
                    any longer be allowed to exercise absolute control either 
                    <br>
                    over freemen or over slaves, but that we will summon an assembly 
                    either of all the people, or of the rich only, that anybody 
                    who likes, whatever may be his calling, or even if he have 
                    no calling, may offer an opinion either about seamanship or 
                    about diseases-whether as to the manner in which physic or 
                    surgical instruments are to be applied to the patient, or 
                    again about the vessels and the nautical implements<br>
                    which are required in navigation, and how to meet the <br>
                    dangers of winds and waves which are incidental to the voyage, 
                    how to behave when encountering pirates, and what is to be 
                    done with the old fashioned galleys, if they have to fight 
                    with others of a similar build-and that, whatever shall be 
                    decreed by the multitude on these <br>
                    points, upon the advice of persons skilled or unskilled, shall 
                    be written down on triangular tablets and columns, or enacted 
                    although unwritten to be national customs; and that in all 
                    future time vessels shall be navigated and remedies administered 
                    to the patient after <br>
                    this fashion.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What a strange notion!<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Suppose further, that the pilots and physicians are 
                    appointed<br>
                    annually, either out of the rich, or out of the whole people, 
                    and that<br>
                    they are elected by lot; and that after their election they 
                    navigate<br>
                    vessels and heal the sick according to the written rules.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Worse and worse.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But hear what follows:-When the year of office has <br>
                    expired, the pilot or physician has to come before a court 
                    of review, in which the judges are either selected from the 
                    wealthy classes or chosen by lot out of the whole people; 
                    and anybody who pleases may be their accuser, and may lay 
                    to their charge, that during the past year they have not navigated 
                    their vessels or healed their patients <br>
                    according to the letter of the law and the ancient customs 
                    of their ancestors;S and if either of them is condemned, some 
                    of the judges must fix what he is to suffer or pay.</p>
                  <p> Y. Soc. He who is willing to take a command under such conditions,<br>
                    deserves to suffer any penalty.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yet once more, we shall have to enact that if any one 
                    is<br>
                    detected enquiring into piloting and navigation, or into health 
                    and<br>
                    the true nature of medicine, or about the winds, or other 
                    conditions<br>
                    of the atmosphere, contrary to the written rules, and has 
                    any<br>
                    ingenious notions about such matters, he is not to be called 
                    a pilot<br>
                    or physician, but a cloudy prating sophist;-further, on the 
                    ground<br>
                    that he is a corrupter of the young, who would persuade them. 
                    to<br>
                    follow the art of medicine or piloting in an unlawful manner, 
                    and to<br>
                    exercise an arbitrary rule over their patients or ships, any 
                    one who<br>
                    is qualified by law may inform against him, and indict him 
                    in some<br>
                    court, and then if he is found to be persuading any, whether 
                    young<br>
                    or old, to act contrary to the written law, he is to be punished<br>
                    with the utmost rigour; for no one should presume to be <br>
                    wiser than the laws; and as touching healing and health and 
                    piloting and navigation, the nature of them is known to all, 
                    for anybody may<br>
                    learn the written laws and the national customs. If such were 
                    the mode<br>
                    of procedure, Socrates, about these sciences and about generalship,<br>
                    and any branch of hunting, or about painting or imitation 
                    in<br>
                    general, or carpentry, or any sort of handicraft, or husbandry, 
                    or<br>
                    planting, or if we were to see an art of rearing horses, or 
                    tending<br>
                    herds, or divination, or any ministerial service, or draught-playing, 
                    or any science conversant with number, whether simple or square 
                    or cube, or comprising motion-I say, if all these things were 
                    done in this way according to written regulations, and not 
                    according to art, what would be the result?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. All the arts would utterly perish, and could never 
                    be<br>
                    recovered, because enquiry would be unlawful. And human <br>
                    life, which is bad enough already, would then become utterly 
                    unendurable.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But what, if while compelling all these operations to 
                    be<br>
                    regulated by written law, we were to appoint as the guardian 
                    of the<br>
                    laws some one elected by a show of hands, or by lot, and he 
                    caring<br>
                    nothing about the laws, were to act contrary to them from 
                    motives of<br>
                    interest or favour, and without knowledge-would not this be 
                    a still<br>
                    worse evil than the former?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. To go against the laws, which are based upon long experience,<br>
                    and the wisdom of counsellors who have graciously <br>
                    recommended them and persuaded the multitude to pass them, 
                    would be a far greater and more ruinous error than any adherence 
                    to written law?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Therefore, as there is a danger of this, the next <br>
                    best thing in legislating is not to allow either the individual 
                    or the multitude to break the law in any respect whatever.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The laws would be copies of the true particulars of 
                    action as<br>
                    far as they admit of being written down from the lips of those 
                    who<br>
                    have knowledge?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly they would.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And, as we were saying, he who has knowledge and is 
                    a true<br>
                    Statesman, will do many things within his own sphere of action 
                    by<br>
                    his art without regard to the laws, when he is of opinion 
                    that<br>
                    something other than that which he has written down and <br>
                    enjoined to be observed during his absence would be better.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes, we said so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And any individual or any number of men, having fixed 
                    laws,<br>
                    in acting contrary to them with a view to something better, 
                    <br>
                    would only be acting, as far as they are able, like the true 
                    Statesman?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. If they had no knowledge of what they were doing, they 
                    would<br>
                    imitate the truth, and they would always imitate ill; but 
                    if they<br>
                    had knowledge, the imitation would be the perfect truth, and 
                    an<br>
                    imitation no longer.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the principle that no great number of men are able 
                    to<br>
                    acquire a knowledge of any art has been already admitted by 
                    us.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes, it has.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then the royal or political art, if there be such an 
                    art,<br>
                    will never be attained either by the wealthy or by the other 
                    mob.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Impossible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then the nearest approach which these lower forms of 
                    <br>
                    government can ever make to the true government of the one 
                    scientific ruler, is to do nothing contrary to their own written 
                    laws and <br>
                    national customs.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. When the rich imitate the true form, such a government 
                    is<br>
                    called aristocracy; and when they are regardless of the laws,<br>
                    oligarchy.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Or again, when an individual rules according to law 
                    in<br>
                    imitation of him who knows, we call him a king; and if he 
                    rules<br>
                    according to law, we give him the same name, whether he rules 
                    with<br>
                    opinion or with knowledge.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. To be sure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And when an individual truly possessing knowledge rules, 
                    his<br>
                    name will surely be the same-he will be called a king; and 
                    thus the<br>
                    five names of governments, as they are now reckoned, become 
                    one.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. That is true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And when an individual ruler governs neither by law 
                    nor by<br>
                    custom, but following in the steps of the true man of <br>
                    science pretends that he can only act for the best by violating 
                    the laws, while in reality appetite and ignorance are the 
                    motives of the imitation, may not such an one be called a 
                    tyrant?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And this we believe to be the origin of the tyrant and 
                    the<br>
                    king, of oligarchies, and aristocracies, and democracies-because 
                    men<br>
                    are offended at the one monarch, and can never be made to 
                    <br>
                    believe that any one can be worthy of such authority, or is 
                    able and <br>
                    willing in the spirit of virtue and knowledge to act justly 
                    and holily to all; they fancy that he will be a despot who 
                    will wrong and harm and slay whom he pleases of us; for if 
                    there could be such a despot as we<br>
                    describe, they would acknowledge that we ought to be too glad 
                    to<br>
                    have him, and that he alone would be the happy ruler of a 
                    true and<br>
                    perfect State.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. To be sure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But then, as the State is not like a beehive, and has 
                    no<br>
                    natural head who is at once recognized to be the superior 
                    <br>
                    both in body and in mind, mankind are obliged to meet and 
                    make laws, and endeavour to approach as nearly as they can 
                    to the true form of government.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And when the foundation of politics is in the letter 
                    only and<br>
                    in custom, and knowledge is divorced from action, can we wonder<br>
                    Socrates, at the miseries which there are, and always will 
                    be, in<br>
                    States? Any other art, built on such a foundation and thus<br>
                    conducted, would ruin all that it touched. Ought we not rather 
                    to<br>
                    wonder at the natural strength of the political bond? For 
                    States<br>
                    have endured all this, time out of mind, and yet some of them 
                    still<br>
                    remain and are not overthrown, though many of them, like <br>
                    ships at sea, founder from time to time, and perish, and have 
                    perished and will hire after perish, through the badness of 
                    their pilots and crews, who have the worst sort of ignorance 
                    of the highest truths-I mean to say, that they are wholly 
                    unaquainted with politics, of which, above all other sciences, 
                    they believe themselves to have acquired the<br>
                    most perfect knowledge.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then the question arises:-which of these untrue forms 
                    of<br>
                    government is the least oppressive to their subjects, though 
                    they<br>
                    are all oppressive; and which is the worst of them? Here is 
                    a<br>
                    consideration which is beside our present purpose, and yet 
                    having<br>
                    regard to the whole it seems to influence all our actions: 
                    we must<br>
                    examine it.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes, we must.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You may say that of the three forms, the same is at 
                    once the<br>
                    hardest and the easiest.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I am speaking of the three forms of government, which 
                    I<br>
                    mentioned at the beginning of this discussion-monarchy, the 
                    rule of<br>
                    the few, and the rule of the many.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. If we divide each of these we shall have six, from which 
                    the<br>
                    true one may be distinguished as a seventh.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How would you make the division?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Monarchy divides into royalty and tyranny; the rule 
                    of the<br>
                    few into aristocracy, which has an auspicious name, and <br>
                    oligarchy; and democracy or the rule of the many, which before 
                    was one, must now be divided.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. On what principle of division?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. On the same principle as before, although the name is 
                    now<br>
                    discovered to have a twofold meaning;-For the distinction 
                    of ruling<br>
                    with law or without applies to this as well as to the rest.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The division made no difference when we were looking 
                    for the<br>
                    perfect State, as we showed before. But now that this has 
                    been<br>
                    separated off, and, as we said, the others alone are left 
                    for us,<br>
                    the principle of law and the absence of law will bisect them 
                    all.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. That would seem follow, from what has been said.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then monarchy, when bound by good prescriptions or <br>
                    laws, is the best of all the six, and when lawless is the 
                    most bitter and<br>
                    oppressive to the subject.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The government of the few which is intermediate <br>
                    between that of the one and many; is also intermediate in 
                    good and evil; but the government of the many is in every 
                    respect weak and unable to do either any great good or any 
                    great evil, when compared with the others, because the offices 
                    are too minutely subdivided and too many hold them. And this 
                    therefore is the worst of all lawful<br>
                    governments, and the best of all lawless ones. If they are 
                    <br>
                    all without the restraints of law, democracy is the form in 
                    which to <br>
                    live is best; if they are well ordered then this is the last 
                    which you should choose, as royalty, the first form, is the 
                    best, with the <br>
                    exception of the seventh for that excels them all, and is 
                    among States what God is among men.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. You are quite right, and we should choose that above 
                    all.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The members of all these States, with the exception 
                    of the<br>
                    one which has knowledge may be set aside as being not Statesmen 
                    but partisans-upholders of the most monstrous idols, and <br>
                    themselves idols;and, being the greatest imitators and magicians, 
                    they are also the greatest of Sophists.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. The name of Sophist after many windings in the argument<br>
                    appears to have been most justly fixed upon the politicians, 
                    as they<br>
                    are termed.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And so our satyric drama has been played out; and the 
                    troop<br>
                    of Centaurs and Satyrs, however unwilling to leave the stage, 
                    have<br>
                    at last been separated from the political science.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. So I perceive.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There remain, however, natures still more troublesome,<br>
                    because they are more nearly akin to the king, and more difficult 
                    to<br>
                    discern; the examination of them may be compared to the process 
                    of<br>
                    refining gold.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What is your meaning?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The workmen begin by sifting away the earth and stones 
                    and<br>
                    the like; there remain in a confused mass the valuable clements 
                    akin<br>
                    to gold, which can only be separated by fire-copper, silver, 
                    <br>
                    and other precious metals; these are at last refined away 
                    by the use of tests, until the gold is left quite pure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes, that is the way in which these things are said 
                    to be<br>
                    done.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. In like manner, all alien and uncongenial matter has 
                    been<br>
                    separated from political science, and what is precious and 
                    of a<br>
                    kindred nature has been left; there remain the nobler arts 
                    of the<br>
                    general and the judge, and the higher sort of oratory which 
                    <br>
                    is an ally of the royal art, and persuades men to do justice, 
                    and assists in guiding the helm of States:-How can we best 
                    clear away all these,<br>
                    leaving him whom we seek alone and unalloyed?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. That is obviously what has in some way to be attempted.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. If the attempt is all that is wanting, he shall certainly 
                    be<br>
                    brought to light; and I think that the illustration of music 
                    may<br>
                    assist in exhibiting him. Please to answer me a question.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What question?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is such a thing as learning music or handicraft 
                    arts in<br>
                    general?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. There is.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And is there any higher art or science, having power 
                    to<br>
                    decide which of these arts are and are not to be learned;-what 
                    do<br>
                    you say?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I should answer that there is.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And do we acknowledge this science to be different from 
                    the<br>
                    others?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And ought the other sciences to be superior to this, 
                    or no<br>
                    single science to any other? Or ought this science to be the<br>
                    overseer and governor of all the others?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. The latter.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You mean to say that the science which judges whether 
                    we<br>
                    ought to learn or not, must be superior to the science which 
                    is<br>
                    learned or which teaches?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Far superior.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the science which determines whether we ought to 
                    persuade<br>
                    or not, must be superior to the science which is able to persuade?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Of course.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Very good; and to what science do we assign the power 
                    of<br>
                    persuading a multitude by a pleasing tale and not by teaching?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. That power, I think, must clearly be assigned to 
                    rhetoric.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And to what science do we give the power of <br>
                    determining whether we are to employ persuasion or force towards 
                    any one, or to refrain altogether?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. To that science which governs the arts of speech 
                    and<br>
                    persuasion.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Which, if I am not mistaken, will be politics?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Rhetoric seems to be quickly distinguished from <br>
                    politics, being a different species, yet ministering to it.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But what would you think of another sort of power or 
                    science?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What science?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The science which has to do with military operations 
                    against<br>
                    our enemies-is that to be regarded as a science or not?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How can generalship and military tactics be regarded 
                    as<br>
                    other than a science?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And is the art which is able and knows how to advise 
                    when we<br>
                    are to go to war, or to make peace, the same as this or different?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. If we are to be consistent, we must say different.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And we must also suppose that this rules the other, 
                    if we are<br>
                    not to give up our former notion?<br>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And, considering how great and terrible the whole art 
                    of war<br>
                    is, can we imagine any which is superior to it but the truly

                  <p>Str. The art of the general is only ministerial, and therefore 
                    not<br>
                    political?<br>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Does he do anything but decide the dealings of men with 
                    one<br>
                    another to be just or unjust in accordance with the standard 
                    which<br>
                    he receives from the king and legislator-showing his own peculiar<br>
                    virtue only in this, that he is not perverted by gifts, or 
                    fears, or<br>
                    pity, or by any sort of favour or enmity, into deciding the 
                    suits of<br>
                    men with one another contrary to the appointment of the legislator?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. No; his office is such as you describe.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then the inference is that the power of the judge is 
                    <br>
                    not royal,but only the power of a guardian of the law which 
                    ministers to the royal power?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The review of all these sciences shows that none of 
                    them is<br>
                    political or royal. For the truly royal ought not itself to 
                    act, but<br>
                    to rule over those who are able to act; the king ought to 
                    <br>
                    know what is and what is not a fitting opportunity for taking 
                    the initiative in matters of the greatest importance, whilst 
                    others, should execute his orders.<br>

                    they<br>
                    have no authority over themselves or one another, but are 
                    <br>
                    each of them concerned with some special action of their own, 
                    have, as they ought to have, special names corresponding to 
                    their several actions. </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I agree.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the science which is over them all, and has charge 
                    of the<br>
                    laws, and of all matters affecting the State, and truly weaves 
                    them<br>
                    all into one, if we would describe under a name characteristic 
                    of<br>
                    their common nature, most truly we may call politics.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Exactly so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then, now that we have discovered the various classes 
                    in a<br>
                    State, shall I analyse politics after the pattern which weaving<br>
                    supplied?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I greatly wish that you would.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then I must describe the nature of the royal web, and 
                    show<br>

                  <p>Str. A task has to be accomplished, which although difficult,<br>
                    appears to be necessary.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly the attempt must be made.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. To assume that one part of virtue differs in kind <br>
                    from another,is a position easily assailable by contentious 
                    disputants, who appeal to popular opinion.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I do not understand.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let me put the matter in another way: I suppose that 
                    you<br>

                  <p>Str. And you would think temperance to be different from 
                    courage;<br>
                    and likewise to be a part of virtue?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I shall venture to put forward a strange theory about 
                    them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What is it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. That they are two principles which thoroughly hate one<br>
                    another and are antagonistic throughout a great part of nature.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How singular!<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes very-for all the parts of virtue are commonly said 
                    to be<br>
                    friendly to one another.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then let us carefully investigate whether this is universally<br>
                    true, or whether there are not parts of virtue which are at 
                    war with<br>
                    their kindred in some respect.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Tell me how we shall consider that question.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. We must extend our enquiry to all those things which 
                    we<br>
                    consider beautiful and at the same time place in two <br>
                    opposite classes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Explain; what are they?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Acuteness and quickness, whether in body or soul or 
                    in the<br>
                    movement of sound, and the imitations of them which painting 
                    <br>
                    and music<br>
                    supply, you must have praised yourself before now, or been 
                    present<br>
                    when others praised them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And do you remember the terms in which they are praised?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I do not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I wonder whether I can explain to you in words the thought<br>
                    which is passing in my mind.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Why not?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You fancy that this is all so easy: Well, let us <br>
                    consider these notions with reference to the opposite classes 
                    of action under which they fall. When we praise quickness 
                    and energy and acuteness, whether of mind or body or sound, 
                    we express our praise of the quality which we admire by one 
                    word, and that one word is manliness or courage.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. We speak of an action as energetic and brave, quick 
                    and<br>
                    manly, and vigorous too; and when we apply the name of which 
                    I speak as the common attribute of all these natures, we certainly 
                    praise<br>
                    them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And do we not often praise the quiet strain of action 
                    also?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. To be sure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And do we not then say the opposite of what we said 
                    of the<br>
                    other?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. We exclaim How calm! How temperate! in admiration of 
                    the slow<br>
                    and quiet working of the intellect, and of steadiness and 
                    gentleness<br>
                    in action, of smoothness and depth of voice, and of all rhythmical<br>
                    movement and of music in general, when these have a proper<br>
                    solemnity. Of all such actions we predicate not courage, but 
                    a name<br>
                    indicative of order.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But when, on the other hand, either of these is out 
                    of place,<br>
                    the names of either are changed into terms of censure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How so?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Too great sharpness or quickness or hardness is <br>
                    termed violence or madness; too great slowness or gentleness 
                    is called cowardice or sluggishness; and we may observe, that 
                    for the most part these qualities, and the temperance and 
                    manliness of the opposite characters, are arrayed as enemies 
                    on opposite sides, and do not mingle with one another in their 
                    respective actions; and if we<br>
                    pursue the enquiry, we shall find that men who have these 
                    different<br>
                    qualities of mind differ from one another.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. In what respect?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. In respect of all the qualities which I mentioned, and 
                    very<br>
                    likely of many others. According to their respective affinities 
                    to<br>
                    either class of actions they distribute praise and <br>
                    blame-praise to the actions which are akin to their own, blame 
                    to those of the opposite party-and out of this many quarrels 
                    and occasions of quarrel arise among them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The difference between the two classes is often a trivial<br>
                    concern; but in a state, and when affecting really important<br>
                    matters, becomes of all disorders the most hateful.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. To what do you refer?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. To nothing short of the whole regulation of human <br>
                    life. For the orderly class are always ready to lead a peaceful 
                    life, quietly doing their own business; this is their manner 
                    of behaving with all men at home, and they are equally ready 
                    to find some way of keeping the peace with foreign States. 
                    And on account of this fondness of theirs for peace, which 
                    is often out of season where their influence prevails, they 
                    become by degrees unwarlike, and bring up their young men 
                    to be like themselves; they are at the mercy of their enemies; 
                    whence in a few years they and their children and the whole 
                    <br>
                    city often pass imperceptibly from the condition of freemen 
                    into that of slaves.</p>
                  <p> Y. Soc. What a cruel fate!<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And now think of what happens with the more <br>
                    courageous natures. Are they not always inciting their country 
                    to go to war, owing to their excessive love of the military 
                    life? they raise up enemies against themselves many and mighty, 
                    and either utterly ruin their native land or enslave and subject 
                    it to its foes?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. That, again, is true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Must we not admit, then, that where these two classes 
                    exist.<br>
                    they always feel the greatest antipathy and antagonism towards 
                    one<br>
                    another?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. We cannot deny it.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And returning to the enquiry with which we began, have 
                    we not<br>
                    found that considerable portions of virtue are at variance 
                    with one<br>
                    another, and give rise to a similar opposition in the characters 
                    who<br>
                    are endowed with them?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us consider a further point.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What is it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I want to know, whether any constructive art will make 
                    any,<br>
                    even the most trivial thing, out of bad and good materials<br>
                    indifferently, if this can be helped? does not all art rather 
                    reject<br>
                    the bad as far as possible, and accept the good and fit <br>
                    materials, and from these elements, whether like or unlike, 
                    gathering them all into one, work out some nature or idea?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. To, be sure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then the true and natural art of statesmanship will 
                    <br>
                    never allow any State to be formed by a combination of good 
                    and bad men, if this can be avoided; but will begin by testing 
                    human natures in play, and after testing them, will entrust 
                    them to proper teachers who are the ministers of her purposes-she 
                    will herself give orders, and maintain authority; just as 
                    the art of weaving continually gives orders and maintains 
                    authority over the carders and all the others who prepare 
                    the material for the work, commanding the subsidiary arts 
                    to execute the works which she deems necessary for making 
                    the web.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. In like manner, the royal science appears to me to be 
                    the<br>
                    mistress of all lawful educators and instructors, and having 
                    this<br>
                    queenly power, will not permit them to train men in what will<br>
                    produce characters unsuited to the political constitution 
                    which she<br>
                    desires to create, but only in what will produce such as are 
                    <br>
                    suitable. Those which have no share of manliness and temperance, 
                    or any other virtuous inclination, and, from the necessity 
                    of an evil nature, are violently carried away to godlessness 
                    and insolence and <br>
                    injustice, she gets rid of by death and exile, and punishes 
                    them with the greatest of disgraces.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. That is commonly said.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But those who are wallowing in ignorance and baseness 
                    she<br>
                    bows under the yoke of slavery.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Quite right.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The rest of the citizens, out of whom, if they have<br>
                    education, something noble may be made, and who are capable 
                    of being united by the Statesman, the kingly art blends and 
                    weaves together; taking on the one hand those whose natures 
                    tend rather to courage, which is the stronger element and 
                    may be regarded as the warp, and on the other hand those which 
                    incline to order and gentleness, and which are represented 
                    in the figure as spun thick and soft after the manner of the 
                    woof-these, which are naturally opposed, she seeks to bind 
                    and weave together in the following manner:<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. In what manner?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. First of all, she takes the eternal element of the soul 
                    and<br>
                    binds it with a divine cord, to which it is akin, and then 
                    the<br>
                    animal nature, and binds that with human cords.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I do not understand what you mean.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The meaning is, that the opinion about the honourable 
                    and the<br>
                    just and good and their opposites, which is true and confirmed 
                    by<br>
                    reason, is a divine principle, and when implanted in the soul, 
                    is<br>
                    implanted, as I maintain, in a nature of heavenly birth.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes; what else should it be?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Only the Statesman and the good legislator, having the<br>
                    inspiration of the royal muse, can implant this opinion, and 
                    he,<br>
                    only in the rightly educated, whom we were just now describing.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Likely enough.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But him who cannot, we will not designate by any of 
                    the names<br>
                    which are the subject of the present which are the subject 
                    of the<br>
                    present enquiry.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very right.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The courageous soul when attaining this truth becomes<br>
                    civilized, and rendered more capable of partaking of <br>
                    justice; but when not partaking, is inclined to brutality. 
                    Is not that true?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And again, the peaceful and orderly nature, if sharing 
                    in these<br>
                    opinions, becomes temperate and wise, as far as this may be 
                    in a<br>
                    State, but if not, deservedly obtains the ignominious name 
                    of<br>
                    silliness.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Can we say that such a connection as this will lastingly<br>
                    unite the evil with one another or with the good, or that 
                    any<br>
                    science would seriously think of using a bond of this kind 
                    to join<br>
                    such materials?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Impossible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But in those who were originally of a noble nature, 
                    and who<br>
                    have been nurtured in noble ways, and in those only, may we 
                    not say<br>
                    that union is implanted by law, and that this is the medicine 
                    which<br>
                    art prescribes for them, and of all the bonds which unite 
                    the<br>
                    dissimilar and contrary parts of virtue is not this, as I 
                    was<br>
                    saying, the divinest?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Where this divine bond exists there is no difficulty 
                    in<br>
                    imagining, or when you have imagined, in creating the other 
                    bonds,<br>
                    which are human only.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How is that, and what bonds do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Rights of intermarriage, and ties which are formed between<br>
                    States by giving and taking children in marriage, or between<br>
                    individuals by private betrothals and espousals. For most 
                    persons<br>
                    form; marriage connection without due regard to what is best 
                    for the<br>
                    procreation of children.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. In what way?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. They seek after wealth and power, which, in matrimony 
                    are<br>
                    objects not worthy-even of a serious censure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. There is no need to consider them at all.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. More reason is-there to consider the practice of <br>
                    those who make family their chief aim, and to indicate their 
                    error.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. They act on no true principle at all; they seek their 
                    ease<br>
                    and receive with open arms those are like themselves, and 
                    hate those<br>
                    who are unlike them, being too much influenced by feelings 
                    <br>
                    of dislike.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How so?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The quiet orderly class seek for natures like their 
                    <br>
                    own, and as far as they can they marry and give in marriage 
                    exclusively in this class, and the courageous do the same; 
                    they seek natures like their own, whereas they should both 
                    do precisely the opposite.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How and why is that?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Because courage, when untempered by the gentler nature 
                    during<br>
                    many generations, may at first bloom and strengthen, but at 
                    last<br>
                    bursts forth into downright madness.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Like enough.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And then, again, the soul which is over-full of <br>
                    modesty and has no element of courage in many successive generations, 
                    is apt to grow too indolent, and at last to become utterly 
                    paralyzed and useless.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. That, again, is quite likely.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. It was of these bonds I said that there would be no<br>
                    difficulty in creating them, if only both classes originally 
                    held<br>
                    the same opinion about the honourable and good;-indeed, in 
                    <br>
                    this single work, the whole process of royal weaving is comprised-never 
                    to allow temperate natures to be separated from the brave, 
                    but to weave them together, like the warp and the woof, by 
                    common sentiments and honours and reputation, and by the giving 
                    of pledges to one another; and out of them forming one smooth 
                    and even web, to entrust to them the offices of State.</p>
                  <p> Y. Soc. How do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Str. Where one officer only is needed, you must choose a 
                    ruler who has both these qualities-when many, you must mingle 
                    some of each,<br>
                    for the temperate ruler is very careful and just and safe, 
                    but is<br>
                    wanting in thoroughness and go.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly, that is very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The character of the courageous, on the other hand, 
                    <br>
                    falls short of the former in justice and caution, but has 
                    the power of <br>
                    action in a remarkable degree, and where either of these two 
                    qualities <br>
                    is wanting there cities. cannot altogether prosper either 
                    in their public or private life.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly they cannot.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. This then we declare to be the completion of the web 
                    of<br>
                    political Action, which is created by a direct intertexture 
                    of the<br>
                    brave and temperate natures, whenever the royal science has 
                    drawn<br>
                    the two minds into communion with one another by unanimity 
                    and<br>
                    friendship, and having perfected the noblest and best of all 
                    the<br>
                    webs which political life admits, and enfolding therein all 
                    other<br>
                    inhabitants of cities, whether slaves or freemen, binds them 
                    in one<br>
                    fabric and governs and presides over them, and, in so far 
                    as to be<br>
                    happy is vouchsafed to a city, in no particular fails to secure<br>
                    their happiness.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Your picture, Stranger, of the king and statesman, 
                    no less<br>
                    than of the Sophist, is quite perfect.</p>

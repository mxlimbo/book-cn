                    Athenian Stranger. And now, what will this city be? I do not 
                    mean toask what is or will hereafter be the name of the place; 
                    that may bedetermined by the accident of locality or of the 
                    original settlement-ariver or fountain, or some local deity 
                    may give the sanction of a nameto the newly-founded city; 
                    but I do want to know what the situationis, whether maritime 
                    or inland.</p>
                  <p>Cleinias. I should imagine, Stranger, that the city of which 
                    weare speaking is about eighty stadia distant from the sea.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And are there harbours on the seaboard?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Excellent harbours, Stranger; there could not be better.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Alas! what a prospect! And is the surrounding countryproductive, 
                    or in need of importations?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Hardly in need of anything.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And is there any neighbouring State?</p>
                  <p>Cle. None whatever, and that is the reason for selecting 
                    theplace; in days of old, there was a migration of the inhabitants, 
                    andthe region has been deserted from time immemorial.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And has the place a fair proportion of hill, and plain, 
                    andwood?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Like the rest of Crete in that.</p>
                  <p>Ath. You mean to say that there is more rock than plain?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Exactly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then there is some hope that your citizens may be virtuous: 
                    hadyou been on the sea, and well provided with harbours, and 
                    an importingrather than a producing country, some mighty saviour 
                    would have beenneeded, and lawgivers more than mortal, if 
                    you were ever to have achance of preserving your state from 
                    degeneracy and discordance ofmanners. But there is comfort 
                    in the eighty stadia; although the seais too near, especially 
                    if, as you say, the harbours are so good.Still we may be content. 
                    The sea is pleasant enough as a dailycompanion, but has indeed 
                    also a bitter and brackish quality;filling the streets with 
                    merchants and shopkeepers, and begetting inthe souls of men 
                    uncertain and unfaithful ways-making the stateunfriendly and 
                    unfaithful both to her own citizens, and also toother nations. 
                    There is a consolation, therefore, in the countryproducing 
                    all things at home; and yet, owing to the ruggedness ofthe 
                    soil, not providing anything in great abundance. Had there 
                    beenabundance, there might have been a great export trade, 
                    and a greatreturn of gold and silver; which, as we may safely 
                    affirm, has themost fatal results on a State whose aim is 
                    the attainment of justand noble sentiments: this was said 
                    by us, if you remember, in theprevious discussion.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I remember, and am of opinion that we both were and 
                    are inthe right.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, but let me ask, how is the country supplied with 
                    timberfor ship-building?</p>
                  <p>Cle. There is no fir of any consequence, nor pine, and not 
                    muchcypress; and you will find very little stone-pine or plane-wood, 
                    whichshipwrights always require for the interior of ships.</p>
                  <p>Ath. These are also natural advantages.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Why so?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Because no city ought to be easily able to imitate itsenemies 
                    in what is mischievous.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How does that bear upon any of the matters of which 
                    we havebeen speaking?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Remember, my good friend, what I said at first about 
                    the Cretanlaws, that they look to one thing only, and this, 
                    as you bothagreed, was war; and I replied that such laws, 
                    in so far as theytended to promote virtue, were good; but 
                    in that they regarded apart only, and not the whole of virtue, 
                    I disapproved of them. And nowI hope that you in your turn 
                    will follow and watch me if I legislatewith a view to anything 
                    but virtue, or with a view to a part of virtueonly. For I 
                    consider that the true lawgiver, like an archer, aims onlyat 
                    that on which some eternal beauty is always attending, anddismisses 
                    everything else, whether wealth or any other benefit, whenseparated 
                    from virtue. I was saying that the imitation of enemieswas 
                    a bad thing; and I was thinking of a case in which a maritimepeople 
                    are harassed by enemies, as the Athenians were by Minos (I 
                    donot speak from any desire to recall past grievances); but 
                    he, as weknow, was a great naval potentate, who compelled 
                    the inhabitants ofAttica to pay him a cruel tribute; and in 
                    those days they had no shipsof war as they now have, nor was 
                    the country filled withship-timber, and therefore they could 
                    not readily build them. Hencethey could not learn how to imitate 
                    their enemy at sea, and in thisway, becoming sailors themselves, 
                    directly repel their enemies. Betterfor them to have lost 
                    many times over the seven youths, than thatheavy-armed and 
                    stationary troops should have been turned intosailors, and 
                    accustomed to be often leaping on shore, and again tocome 
                    running back to their ships; or should have fancied that therewas 
                    no disgrace in not awaiting the attack of an enemy and dyingboldly; 
                    and that there were good reasons, and plenty of them, for 
                    aman throwing away his arms, and betaking himself to flight-which 
                    isnot dishonourable, as people say, at certain times. This 
                    is thelanguage of naval warfare, and is anything but worthy 
                    of extraordinarypraise. For we should not teach bad habits, 
                    least of all to the bestpart of the citizens. You may learn 
                    the evil of such a practice fromHomer, by whom Odysseus is 
                    introduced, rebuking Agamemnon because hedesires to draw down 
                    the ships to the sea at a time when theAchaeans are hard pressed 
                    by the Trojans-he gets angry with him, andsays:</p>
                  <p>Who, at a time when the battle is in full cry, biddest to 
                    drag thewell-benched ships into the sea, that the prayers 
                    of the Trojans maybe accomplished yet more, and high ruin 
                    falls upon us. For theAchaeans will not maintain the battle, 
                    when the ships are drawn intothe sea, but they will look behind 
                    and will cease from strife; in thatthe counsel which you give 
                    will prove injurious.You see that he quite knew triremes on 
                    the sea, in the neighbourhoodof fighting men, to be an evil;-lions 
                    might be trained in that wayto fly from a herd of deer. Moreover, 
                    naval powers which owe theirsafety to ships, do not give honour 
                    to that sort of warlike excellencewhich is most deserving 
                    of it. For he who owes his safety to the pilotand the captain, 
                    and the oarsman, and all sorts of rather inferiorpersons cannot 
                    rightly give honour to whom honour is due. But howcan a state 
                    be in a right condition which cannot justly award honour?</p>
                  <p>Cle. It is hardly possible, I admit; and yet, Stranger, we 
                    Cretansare in the habit of saying that the battle of Salamis 
                    was thesalvation of Hellas.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Why, yes; and that is an opinion which is widely spread 
                    bothamong Hellenes and barbarians. But Megillus and I say 
                    rather, that thebattle of Marathon was the beginning, and 
                    the battle of Plataea thecompletion, of the great deliverance, 
                    and that these battles by landmade the Hellenes better; whereas 
                    the sea-fights of Salamis andArtemisium-for I may as well 
                    put them both together-made them nobetter, if I may say so 
                    without offence about the battles which helpedto save us. 
                    And in estimating the goodness of a state, we regardboth the 
                    situation of the country and the order of the laws,considering 
                    that the mere preservation and continuance of life isnot the 
                    most honourable thing for men, as the vulgar think, but thecontinuance 
                    of the best life, while we live; and that again, if I amjot 
                    mistaken, is remark which has been made already.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then we have only to ask whether we are taking the course 
                    whichwe acknowledge to be the best for the settlement and 
                    legislation ofstates.</p>
                  <p>Cle. The best by far.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And now let me proceed to another question: Who are 
                    to be thecolonists? May any one come out of all Crete; and 
                    is the idea that thepopulation in the several states is too 
                    numerous for the means ofsubsistence? For I suppose that you 
                    are not going to send out ageneral invitation to any Hellene 
                    who likes to come. And yet I observethat to your country settlers 
                    have come from Argos and Aegina andother parts of Hellas. 
                    Tell me, then, whence do you draw your recruitsin the present 
                    enterprise?</p>
                  <p>Cle. They will come from all Crete; and of other Hellenes,Peloponnesians 
                    will be most acceptable. For, as you truly observe,there are 
                    Cretans of Argive descent; and the race of Cretans which hasthe 
                    highest character at the present day is the Gortynian, and 
                    thishas come from Gortys in the Peloponnesus.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Cities find colonization in some respects easier if 
                    thecolonists are one race, which like a swarm of bees is sent 
                    out froma single country, either when friends leave friends, 
                    owing to somepressure of population or other similar necessity, 
                    or when a portionof a state is driven by factions to emigrate. 
                    And there have beenwhole cities which have taken flight when 
                    utterly conquered by asuperior power in war. This, however, 
                    which is in one way an advantageto the colonist or legislator, 
                    in another point of view creates adifficulty. There is an 
                    element of friendship in the community ofrace, and language, 
                    and language, and laws, and in common templesand rites of 
                    worship; but colonies which are of this homogeneoussort are 
                    apt to kick against any laws or any form of constitutiondiffering 
                    from that which they had at home; and although the badnessof 
                    their own laws may have been the cause of the factions whichprevailed 
                    among them, yet from the force of habit they would fainpreserve 
                    the very customs which were their ruin, and the leader of 
                    thecolony, who is their legislator, finds them troublesome 
                    andrebellious. On the other hand, the conflux of several populationsmight 
                    be more disposed to listen to new laws; but then, to make 
                    themcombine and pull together, as they say of horses, is a 
                    mostdifficult task, and the work of years. And yet there is 
                    nothingwhich tends more to the improvement of mankind than 
                    legislation andcolonization.</p>
                  <p>Cle. No doubt; but I should like to know why you say so.</p>
                  <p>Ath. My good friend, I am afraid that the course of myspeculations 
                    is leading me to say something depreciatory oflegislators; 
                    but if the word be to the purpose, there can be noharm. And 
                    yet, why am I disquieted, for I believe that the sameprinciple 
                    applies equally to all human things?</p>
                  <p>Cle. To what are you referring?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I was going to say that man never legislates, but accidentsof 
                    all sorts, which legislate for us in all sorts of ways. Theviolence 
                    of war and the hard necessity of poverty are constantlyoverturning 
                    governments and changing laws. And the power of discasehas 
                    often caused innovations in the state, when there have beenpestilences, 
                    or when there has been a succession of bad seasonscontinuing 
                    during many years. Any one who sees all this, naturallyrushes 
                    to the conclusion of which I was speaking, that no mortallegislates 
                    in anything, but that in human affairs chance is almosteverything. 
                    And this may be said of the arts of the sailor, and thepilot, 
                    and the physician, and the general, and may seem to be wellsaid; 
                    and yet there is another thing which may be said with equaltruth 
                    of all of them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is it?</p>
                  <p>Ath. That God governs all things, and that chance and opportunityco-operate 
                    with him in the government of human affairs. There is,however, 
                    a third and less extreme view, that art should be there also;for 
                    I should say that in a storm there must surely be a greatadvantage 
                    in having the aid of the pilot's art. You would agree?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And does not a like principle apply to legislation as 
                    well asto other things: even supposing all the conditions 
                    to be favourablewhich are needed for the happiness of the 
                    state, yet the truelegislator must from time to time appear 
                    on the scene?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Most true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. In each case the artist would be able to pray rightly 
                    forcertain conditions, and if these were granted by fortune, 
                    he wouldthen only require to exercise his art?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And all the other artists just now mentioned, if they 
                    werebidden to offer up each their special prayer, would do 
                    so?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Of course.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And the legislator would do likewise?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I believe that he would.</p>
                  <p>Ath. &quot;Come, legislator,&quot; we will say to him; &quot;what 
                    are theconditions which you require in a state before you 
                    can organize it?&quot;How ought he to answer this question? 
                    Shall I give his answer?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. He will say-&quot;Give me a state which is governed 
                    by a tyrant, andlet the tyrant be young and have a good memory; 
                    let him be quick atlearning, and of a courageous and noble 
                    nature; let him have thatquality which, as I said before, 
                    is the inseparable companion of allthe other parts of virtue, 
                    if there is to be any good in them.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Cle. I suppose, Megillus, that this companion virtue of which 
                    theStranger speaks, must be temperance?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes, Cleinias, temperance in the vulgar sense; not that 
                    whichin the forced and exaggerated language of some philosophers 
                    iscalled prudence, but that which is the natural gift of children 
                    andanimals, of whom some live continently and others incontinently, 
                    butwhen isolated, was as we said, hardly worth reckoning in 
                    the catalogueof goods. I think that you must understand my 
                    meaning.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then our tyrant must have this as well as the otherqualities, 
                    if the state is to acquire in the best manner and in theshortest 
                    time the form of government which is most conducive tohappiness; 
                    for there neither is nor ever will be a better orspeedier 
                    way of establishing a polity than by a tyranny.</p>
                  <p>Cle. By what possible arguments, Stranger, can any man persuadehimself 
                    of such a monstrous doctrine?</p>
                  <p>Ath. There is surely no difficulty in seeing, Cleinias, what 
                    is inaccordance with the order of nature?</p>
                  <p>Cle. You would assume, as you say, a tyrant who was young,temperate, 
                    quick at learning, having a good memory, courageous, of anoble 
                    nature?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes; and you must add fortunate; and his good fortune 
                    must bethat he is the contemporary of a great legislator, 
                    and that some happychance brings them together. When this 
                    has been accomplished, Godhas done all that he ever does for 
                    a state which he desires to beeminently prosperous; He has 
                    done second best for a state in whichthere are two such rulers, 
                    and third best for a state in which thereare three. The difficulty 
                    increases with the increase, anddiminishes with the diminution 
                    of the number.</p>
                  <p>Cle. You mean to say, I suppose, that the best government 
                    isproduced from a tyranny, and originates in a good lawgiver 
                    and anorderly tyrant, and that the change from such a tyranny 
                    into a perfectform of government takes place most easily; 
                    less easily when from anoligarchy; and, in the third degree, 
                    from a democracy: is not thatyour meaning?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Not so; I mean rather to say that the change is best 
                    made outof a tyranny; and secondly, out of a monarchy; and 
                    thirdly, out ofsome sort of democracy: fourth, in the capacity 
                    for improvement, comesoligarchy, which has the greatest difficulty 
                    in admitting of such achange, because the government is in 
                    the hands of a number ofpotentates. I am supposing that the 
                    legislator is by nature of thetrue sort, and that his strength 
                    is united with that of the chiefmen of the state; and when 
                    the ruling element is numerically small,and at the same time 
                    very strong, as in a tyranny, there the change islikely to 
                    be easiest and most rapid.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How? I do not understand.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And yet I have repeated what I am saying a good many 
                    times; butI suppose that you have never seen a city which 
                    is under a tyranny?</p>
                  <p>Cle. No, and I cannot say that I have any great desire to 
                    see one.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And yet, where there is a tyranny, you might certainly 
                    see thatof which I am now speaking.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I mean that you might see how, without trouble and in 
                    no verylong period of time, the tyrant, if he wishes, can 
                    change themanners of a state: he has only to go in the direction 
                    of virtue or ofvice, whichever he prefers, he himself indicating 
                    by his example thelines of conduct, praising and rewarding 
                    some actions and reprovingothers, and degrading those who 
                    disobey.</p>
                  <p>Cle. But how can we imagine that the citizens in general 
                    will atonce follow the example set to them; and how can he 
                    have this powerboth of persuading and of compelling them?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let no one, my friends, persuade us that there is any 
                    quickerand easier way in which states change their laws than 
                    when therulers lead: such changes never have, nor ever will, 
                    come to pass inany other way. The real impossibility or difficulty 
                    is of anothersort, and is rarely surmounted in the course 
                    of ages; but when once itis surmounted, ten thousand or rather 
                    all blessings follow.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Of what are you speaking?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The difficulty is to find the divine love of temperate 
                    and justinstitutions existing in any powerful forms of government, 
                    whetherin a monarchy or oligarchy of wealth or of birth. You 
                    might as wellhope to reproduce the character of Nestor, who 
                    is said to haveexcelled all men in the power of speech, and 
                    yet more in histemperance. This, however, according to the 
                    tradition, was in thetimes of Troy; in our own days there 
                    is nothing of the sort; but ifsuch an one either has or ever 
                    shall come into being, or is nowamong us, blessed is he and 
                    blessed are they who hear the wise wordsthat flow from his 
                    lips. And this may be said of power in general:When the supreme 
                    power in man coincides with the greatest wisdom andtemperance, 
                    then the best laws and the best constitution come intobeing; 
                    but in no other way. And let what I have been saying beregarded 
                    as a kind of sacred legend or oracle, and let this be ourproof 
                    that, in one point of view, there may be a difficulty for 
                    a cityto have good laws, but that there is another point of 
                    view in whichnothing can be easier or sooner effected, granting 
                    our supposition.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us try to amuse ourselves, old boys as we are, bymoulding 
                    in words the laws which are suitable to your state.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Let us proceed without delay.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then let us invoke God at the settlement of our state; 
                    may hehear and be propitious to us, and come and set in order 
                    the Stateand the laws!</p>
                  <p>Cle. May he come!</p>
                  <p>Ath. But what form of polity are we going to give the city?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Tell us what you mean a little more clearly. Do you 
                    mean someform of democracy, or oligarchy, or aristocracy, 
                    or monarchy? For wecannot suppose that you would include tyranny.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Which of you will first tell me to which of these classes 
                    hisown government is to be referred?</p>
                  <p>Megillus. Ought I to answer first, since I am the elder?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Perhaps you should.</p>
                  <p>Meg. And yet, Stranger, I perceive that I cannot say, without 
                    morethought, what I should call the government of Lacedaemon, 
                    for it seemsto me to be like a tyranny-the power of our Ephors 
                    is marvellouslytyrannical; and sometimes it appears to me 
                    to be of all cities themost democratical; and who can reasonably 
                    deny that it is anaristocracy? We have also a monarchy which 
                    is held for life, and issaid by all mankind, and not by ourselves 
                    only, to be the most ancientof all monarchies; and, therefore, 
                    when asked on a sudden, I cannotprecisely say which form of 
                    government the Spartan is.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I am in the same difficulty, Megillus; for I do not 
                    feelconfident that the polity of Cnosus is any of these.</p>
                  <p> Ath. The reason is, my excellent friends, that you really 
                    havepolities, but the states of which we were just now speaking 
                    are merelyaggregations of men dwelling in cities who are the 
                    subjects andservants of a part of their own state, and each 
                    of them is named afterthe dominant power; they are not polities 
                    at all. But if states are tobe named after their rulers, the 
                    true state ought to be called bythe name of the God who rules 
                    over wise men.</p>
                  <p>Cle. And who is this God?</p>
                  <p>Ath. May I still make use of fable to some extent, in the 
                    hopethat I may be better able to answer your question: shall 
                    I?</p>
                  <p>Cle. By all means.</p>
                  <p>Ath. In the primeval world, and a long while before the citiescame 
                    into being whose settlements we have described, there is saidto 
                    have been in the time of Cronos a blessed rule and life, of 
                    whichthe best-ordered of existing states is a copy.</p>
                  <p>Cle. It will be very necessary to hear about that.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I quite agree with you; and therefore I have introduced 
                    thesubject.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Most appropriately; and since the tale is to the point, 
                    youwill do well in giving us the whole story.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I will do as you suggest. There is a tradition of the 
                    happylife of mankind in days when all things were spontaneous 
                    and abundant.And of this the reason is said to have been as 
                    follows:-Cronos knewwhat we ourselves were declaring, that 
                    no human nature invested withsupreme power is able to order 
                    human affairs and not overflow withinsolence and wrong. Which 
                    reflection led him to appoint not men butdemigods, who are 
                    of a higher and more divine race, to be the kingsand rulers 
                    of our cities; he did as we do with flocks of sheep andother 
                    tame animals. For we do not appoint oxen to be the lords ofoxen, 
                    or goats of goats; but we ourselves are a superior race, andrule 
                    over them. In like manner God, in his love of mankind, placedover 
                    us the demons, who are a superior race, and they with greatcase 
                    and pleasure to themselves, and no less to us, taking care 
                    us andgiving us peace and reverence and order and justice 
                    never failing,made the tribes of men happy and united. And 
                    this tradition, whichis true, declares that cities of which 
                    some mortal man and not Godis the ruler, have no escape from 
                    evils and toils. Still we must doall that we can to imitate 
                    the life which is said to have existed inthe days of Cronos, 
                    and, as far as the principle of immortality dwellsin us, to 
                    that we must hearken, both in private and public life, andregulate 
                    our cities and houses according to law, meaning by the veryterm 
                    &quot;law,&quot; the distribution of mind. But if either a 
                    single person oran oligarchy or a democracy has a soul eager 
                    after pleasures anddesires-wanting to be filled with them, 
                    yet retaining none of them,and perpetually afflicted with 
                    an endless and insatiable disorder; andthis evil spirit, having 
                    first trampled the laws under foot, becomesthe master either 
                    of a state or of an individual-then, as I wassaying, salvation 
                    is hopeless. And now, Cleinias, we have toconsider whether 
                    you will or will not accept this tale of mine.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly we will.</p>
                  <p>Ath. You are aware-are you not?-that there are of said to 
                    be as manyforms of laws as there are of governments, and of 
                    the latter we havealready mentioned all those which are commonly 
                    recognized. Now youmust regard this as a matter of first-rate 
                    importance. For what isto be the standard of just and unjust, 
                    is once more the point atissue. Men say that the law ought 
                    not to regard either militaryvirtue, or virtue in general, 
                    but only the interests and power andpreservation of the established 
                    form of government; this is thought bythem to be the best 
                    way of expressing the natural definition ofjustice.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Justice is said by them to be the interest of the stronger.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Speak plainer.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I will:-&quot;Surely,&quot; they say, &quot;the governing 
                    power makes whateverlaws have authority in any state?&quot;</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. &quot;Well,&quot; they would add, &quot;and do you suppose 
                    that tyranny ordemocracy, or any other conquering power, does 
                    not make thecontinuance of the power which is possessed by 
                    them the first orprincipal object of their laws?&quot;</p>
                  <p>Cle. How can they have any other?</p>
                  <p>Ath. &quot;And whoever transgresses these laws is punished 
                    as anevil-doer by the legislator, who calls the laws just?&quot;</p>
                  <p>Cle. Naturally.</p>
                  <p>Ath. &quot;This, then, is always the mode and fashion in 
                    which justiceexists.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly, if they are correct in their view.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Why, yes, this is one of those false principles of governmentto 
                    which we were referring.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Which do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Those which we were examining when we spoke of who ought 
                    togovern whom. Did we not arrive at the conclusion that parents 
                    ought togovern their children, and the elder the younger, 
                    and the noble theignoble? And there were many other principles, 
                    if you remember, andthey were not always consistent. One principle 
                    was this very principleof might, and we said that Pindar considered 
                    violence natural andjustified it.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes; I remember.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Consider, then, to whom our state is to be entrusted. 
                    For thereis a thing which has occurred times without number 
                    in states-</p>
                  <p>Cle. What thing?</p>
                  <p>Ath. That when there has been a contest for power, those 
                    who gainthe upper hand so entirely monopolize the government, 
                    as to refuse allshare to the defeated party and their descendants-they 
                    live watchingone another, the ruling class being in perpetual 
                    fear that some onewho has a recollection of former wrongs 
                    will come into power andrise up against them. Now, according 
                    to our view, such governments arenot polities at all, nor 
                    are laws right which are passed for thegood of particular 
                    classes and not for the good of the whole state.States which 
                    have such laws are not polities but parties, and theirnotions 
                    of justice are simply unmeaning. I say this, because I amgoing 
                    to assert that we must not entrust the government in yourstate 
                    to any one because he is rich, or because he possesses any 
                    otheradvantage, such as strength, or stature, or again birth: 
                    but he who ismost obedient to the laws of the state, he shall 
                    win the palm; andto him who is victorious in the first degree 
                    shall be given thehighest office and chief ministry of the 
                    gods; and the second to himwho bears the second palm; and 
                    on a similar principle shall all theother be assigned to those 
                    who come next in order. And when I call therulers servants 
                    or ministers of the law, I give them this name not forthe 
                    sake of novelty, but because I certainly believe that upon 
                    suchservice or ministry depends the well- or ill-being of 
                    the state. Forthat state in which the law is subject and has 
                    no authority, Iperceive to be on the highway to ruin; but 
                    I see that the state inwhich the law is above the rulers, 
                    and the rulers are the inferiors ofthe law, has salvation, 
                    and every blessing which the Gods can confer.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Truly, Stranger, you see with the keen vision of age.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Why, yes; every man when he is young has that sort of 
                    visiondullest, and when he is old keenest.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And now, what is to be the next step? May we not suppose 
                    thecolonists to have arrived, and proceed to make our speech 
                    to them?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. &quot;Friends,&quot; we say to them,-&quot;God, as the 
                    old tradition declares,holding in his hand the beginning, 
                    middle, and end of all that is,travels according to his nature 
                    in a straight line towards theaccomplishment of his end. Justice 
                    always accompanies him, and isthe punisher of those who fall 
                    short of the divine law. To justice, hewho would be happy 
                    holds fast, and follows in her company with allhumility and 
                    order; but he who is lifted up with pride, or elated bywealth 
                    or rank, or beauty, who is young and foolish, and has a soulhot 
                    with insolence, and thinks that he has no need of any guide 
                    orruler, but is able himself to be the guide of others, he, 
                    I say, isleft deserted of God; and being thus deserted, he 
                    takes to himothers who are like himself, and dances about, 
                    throwing all thingsinto confusion, and many think that he 
                    is a great man, but in ashort time he pays a penalty which 
                    justice cannot but approve, andis utterly destroyed, and his 
                    family and city with him. Wherefore,seeing that human things 
                    are thus ordered, what should a wise man door think, or not 
                    do or think?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Every man ought to make up his mind that he will be 
                    one ofthe followers of God; there can be no doubt of that.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then what life is agreeable to God, and becoming in 
                    hisfollowers? One only, expressed once for all in the old 
                    saying that&quot;like agrees with like, with measure measure,&quot; 
                    but things which haveno measure agree neither with themselves 
                    nor with the things whichhave. Now God ought to be to us the 
                    measure of all things, and notman, as men commonly say (Protagoras): 
                    the words are far more trueof him. And he who would be dear 
                    to God must, as far as is possible,be like him and such as 
                    he is. Wherefore the temperate man is thefriend of God, for 
                    he is like him; and the intemperate man is unlikehim, and 
                    different from him, and unjust. And the same applies to otherthings; 
                    and this is the conclusion, which is also the noblest andtruest 
                    of all sayings-that for the good man to offer sacrifice tothe 
                    Gods, and hold converse with them by means of prayers andofferings 
                    and every kind of service, is the noblest and best of allthings, 
                    and also the most conducive to a happy life, and very fitand 
                    meet. But with the bad man, the opposite of this is true: 
                    forthe bad man has an impure soul, whereas the good is pure; 
                    and from onewho is polluted, neither good man nor God can 
                    without improprietyreceive gifts. Wherefore the unholy do 
                    only waste their much serviceupon the Gods, but when offered 
                    by any holy man, such service ismost acceptable to them. This 
                    is the mark at which we ought to aim.But what weapons shall 
                    we use, and how shall we direct them? In thefirst place, we 
                    affirm that next after the Olympian Gods and theGods of the 
                    State, honour should be given to the Gods below; theyshould 
                    receive everything in even and of the second choice, and illomen, 
                    while the odd numbers, and the first choice, and the things 
                    oflucky omen, are given to the Gods above, by him who would 
                    rightlyhit the mark of piety. Next to these Gods, a wise man 
                    will doservice to the demons or spirits, and then to the heroes, 
                    and afterthem will follow the private and ancestral Gods, 
                    who are worshipped asthe law prescribes in the places which 
                    are sacred to them. Nextcomes the honour of living parents, 
                    to whom, as is meet, we have topay the first and greatest 
                    and oldest of all debts, considering thatall which a man has 
                    belongs to those who gave him birth and broughthim up, and 
                    that he must do all that he can to minister to them,first, 
                    in his property, secondly, in his person, and thirdly, in 
                    hissoul, in return for the endless care and travail which 
                    they bestowedupon him of old, in the days of his infancy, 
                    and which he is now topay back to them when they are old and 
                    in the extremity of their need.And all his life long he ought 
                    never to utter, or to have uttered,an unbecoming word to them; 
                    for of light and fleeting words thepenalty is most severe; 
                    Nemesis, the messenger of justice, isappointed to watch over 
                    all such matters. When they are angry and wantto satisfy their 
                    feelings in word or deed, he should give way to them;for a 
                    father who thinks that he has been wronged by his son may 
                    bereasonably expected to be very angry. At their death, the 
                    mostmoderate funeral is best, neither exceeding the customary 
                    expense, noryet falling short of the honour which has been 
                    usually shown by theformer generation to their parents. And 
                    let a man not forget to paythe yearly tribute of respect to 
                    the dead, honouring them chiefly byomitting nothing that conduces 
                    to a perpetual remembrance of them, andgiving a reasonable 
                    portion of his fortune to the dead. Doing this,and living 
                    after this manner, we shall receive our reward from theGods 
                    and those who are above us [i.e., the demons]; and we shall 
                    spendour days for the most part in good hope. And how a man 
                    ought toorder what relates to his descendants and his kindred 
                    and friendsand fellow-citizens, and the rites of hospitality 
                    taught by Heaven,and the intercourse which arises out of all 
                    these duties, with aview to the embellishment and orderly 
                    regulation of his own life-thesethings, I say, the laws, as 
                    we proceed with them, will accomplish,partly persuading, and 
                    partly when natures do not yield to thepersuasion of custom, 
                    chastising them by might and right, and willthus render our 
                    state, if the Gods co-operate with us, prosperousand happy. 
                    But of what has to be said, and must be said by thelegislator 
                    who is of my way of thinking, and yet, if said in theform 
                    of law, would be out of place-of this I think that he may 
                    givea sample for the instruction of himself and of those for 
                    whom he islegislating; and then when, as far as he is able, 
                    he has gonethrough all the preliminaries, he may proceed to 
                    the work oflegislation. Now, what will be the form of such 
                    prefaces? There may bea difficulty in including or describing 
                    them all under a singleform, but I think that we may get some 
                    notion of them if we canguarantee one thing.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is that?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I should wish the citizens to be as readily persuaded 
                    to virtueas possible; this will surely be the aim of the legislator 
                    in allhis laws.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The proposal appears to me to be of some value; and 
                    I thinkthat a person will listen with more gentleness and 
                    good-will to theprecepts addressed to him by the legislator, 
                    when his soul is notaltogether unprepared to receive them. 
                    Even a little done in the wayof conciliation gains his ear, 
                    and is always worth having. For thereis no great inclination 
                    or readiness on the part of mankind to be madeas good, or 
                    as quickly good, as possible. The case of the manyproves the 
                    wisdom of Hesiod, who says that the road to wickedness issmooth 
                    and can be travelled without perspiring, because it is sovery 
                    short:</p>
                  <p>But before virtue the immortal Gods have placed the sweat 
                    of labour,and long and steep is the way thither, and rugged 
                    at first; but whenyou have reached the top, although difficult 
                    before, it is then easy.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes; and he certainly speaks well.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Very true: and now let me tell you the effect which 
                    thepreceding discourse has had upon me.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Proceed.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Suppose that we have a little conversation with the 
                    legislator,and say to him-&quot;O, legislator, speak; if you 
                    know what we ought to sayand do, you can surely tell.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Cle. Of course he can.</p>
                  <p>Ath. &quot;Did we not hear you just now saying, that the 
                    legislator oughtnot to allow the poets to do what they liked? 
                    For that they wouldnot know in which of their words they went 
                    against the laws, to thehurt of the state.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Cle. That is true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. May we not fairly make answer to him on behalf of the 
                    poets?</p>
                  <p>Cle. What answer shall we make to him?</p>
                  <p>Ath. That the poet, according to the tradition which has 
                    everprevailed among us, and is accepted of all men, when he 
                    sits down onthe tripod of the muse, is not in his right mind; 
                    like a fountain,he allows to flow out freely whatever comes 
                    in, and his art beingimitative, he is often compelled to represent 
                    men of oppositedispositions, and thus to contradict himself; 
                    neither can he tellwhether there is more truth in one thing 
                    that he has said than inanother. this is not the case in a 
                    law; the legislator must give nottwo rules about the same 
                    thing, but one only. Take an example fromwhat you have just 
                    been saying. Of three kinds of funerals, there isone which 
                    is too extravagant, another is too niggardly, the third is 
                    amean; and you choose and approve and order the last withoutqualification. 
                    But if I had an extremely rich wife, and she bade mebury her 
                    and describe her burial in a poem, I should praise theextravagant 
                    sort; and a poor miserly man, who had not much money tospend, 
                    would approve of the niggardly; and the man of moderatemeans, 
                    who was himself moderate, would praise a moderate funeral.Now 
                    you in the capacity of legislator must not barely say &quot;amoderate 
                    funeral,&quot; but you must define what moderation is, and 
                    howmuch; unless you are definite, you must not suppose that 
                    you arespeaking a language that can become law.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly not.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And is our legislator to have no preface to his laws, 
                    but tosay at once Do this, avoid that-and then holding the 
                    penalty interrorem to go on to another law; offering never 
                    a word of advice orexhortation to those for whom he is legislating, 
                    after the manner ofsome doctors? For of doctors, as I may 
                    remind you, some have agentler, others a ruder method of cure; 
                    and as children ask the doctorto be gentle with them, so we 
                    will ask the legislator to cure ourdisorders with the gentlest 
                    remedies. What I mean to say is, thatbesides doctors there 
                    are doctors' servants, who are also styleddoctors.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And whether they are slaves or freemen makes no difference;they 
                    acquire their knowledge of medicine by obeying and observingtheir 
                    masters; empirically and not according to the natural way 
                    oflearning, as the manner of freemen is, who have learned 
                    scientificallythemselves the art which they impart scientifically 
                    to their pupils.You are aware that there are these two classes 
                    of doctors?</p>
                  <p>Cle. To be sure.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And did you ever observe that there are two classes 
                    of patientsin states, slaves and freemen; and the slave doctors 
                    run about andcure the slaves, or wait for them in the dispensaries-practitioners 
                    ofthis sort never talk to their patients individually, or 
                    let themtalk about their own individual complaints? The slave 
                    doctorprescribes what mere experience suggests, as if he had 
                    exactknowledge; and when he has given his orders, like a tyrant, 
                    herushes off with equal assurance to some other servant who 
                    is ill;and so he relieves the master of the house of the care 
                    of hisinvalid slaves. But the other doctor, who is a freeman, 
                    attends andpractises upon freemen; and he carries his enquiries 
                    far back, andgoes into the nature of the disorder; he enters 
                    into discourse withthe patient and with his friends, and is 
                    at once getting informationfrom the sick man, and also instructing 
                    him as far as he is able,and he will not prescribe for him 
                    until he has first convinced him; atlast, when he has brought 
                    the patient more and more under hispersuasive influences and 
                    set him on the road to health, he attemptsto effect a cure. 
                    Now which is the better way of proceeding in aphysician and 
                    in a trainer? Is he the better who accomplishes his endsin 
                    a double way, or he who works in one way, and that the ruder 
                    andinferior?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I should say, Stranger, that the double way is far better.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Should you like to see an example of the double and 
                    singlemethod in legislation?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly I should.</p>
                  <p>Ath. What will be our first law? Will not the the order of 
                    nature,begin by making regulations for states about births?</p>
                  <p>Cle. He will.</p>
                  <p>Ath. In all states the birth of children goes back to the 
                    connectionof marriage?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And, according to the true order, the laws relating 
                    to marriageshould be those which are first determined in every 
                    state?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Quite so.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then let me first give the law of marriage in a simple 
                    form; itmay run as follows:-A man shall marry between the 
                    ages of thirty andthirty-five, or, if he does not, he shall 
                    pay such and such a fine, orshall suffer the loss of such 
                    and such privileges. This would be thesimple law about marriage. 
                    The double law would run thus:-A manshall marry between the 
                    ages of thirty and thirty-five, consideringthat in a manner 
                    the human race naturally partakes of immortality,which every 
                    man is by nature inclined to desire to the utmost; for thedesire 
                    of every man that he may become famous, and not lie in thegrave 
                    without a name, is only the love of continuance. Now mankind 
                    arecoeval with all time, and are ever following, and will 
                    ever follow,the course of time; and so they are immortal, 
                    because they leavechildren's children behind them, and partake 
                    of immortality in theunity of generation. And for a man voluntarily 
                    to deprive himself ofthis gift, as he deliberately does who 
                    will not have a wife orchildren, is impiety. He who obeys 
                    the law shall be free, and shallpay no fine; but he who is 
                    disobedient, and does not marry, when hehas arrived at the 
                    age of thirty-five, shall pay a yearly fine of acertain amount, 
                    in order that he may not imagine his celibacy to bringease 
                    and profit to him; and he shall not share in the honours whichthe 
                    young men in the state give to the aged. Comparing now the 
                    twoforms of the law, you will be able to arrive at a judgment 
                    about anyother laws-whether they should be double in length 
                    even when shortest,because they have to persuade as well as 
                    threaten, or whether theyshall only threaten and be of half 
                    the length.</p>
                  <p>Meg. The shorter form, Stranger, would be more in accordance 
                    withLacedaemonian custom; although, for my own part, if any 
                    one were toask me which I myself prefer in the state, I should 
                    certainlydetermine in favour of the longer; and I would have 
                    every law madeafter the same pattern, if I had to choose. 
                    But I think thatCleinias is the person to be consulted, for 
                    his is the state whichis going to use these laws.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Thank you, Megillus.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Whether, in the abstract, words are to be many or few, 
                    is avery foolish question; the best form, and not the shortest, 
                    is to beapproved; nor is length at all to be regarded. Of 
                    the two forms of lawwhich have been recited, the one is not 
                    only twice as good inpractical usefulness as the other, but 
                    the case is like that of thetwo kinds of doctors, which I 
                    was just now mentioning. And yetlegislators never appear to 
                    have considered that they have twoinstruments which they might 
                    use in legislation-persuasion andforce; for in dealing with 
                    the rude and uneducated multitude, they usethe one only as 
                    far as they can; they do not mingle persuasion withcoercion, 
                    but employ force pure and simple. Moreover, there is a thirdpoint, 
                    sweet friends, which ought to be, and never is, regarded in 
                    ourexisting laws.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is it?</p>
                  <p>Ath. A point arising out of our previous discussion, which 
                    comesinto my mind in some mysterious way. All this time, from 
                    early dawnuntil noon, have we been talking about laws in this 
                    charmingretreat: now we are going to promulgate our laws, 
                    and what haspreceded was only the prelude of them. Why do 
                    I mention this? For thisreason:-Because all discourses and 
                    vocal exercises have preludes andovertures, which are a sort 
                    of artistic beginnings intended to helpthe strain which is 
                    to be performed; lyric measures and music of everyother kind 
                    have preludes framed with wonderful care. But of thetruer 
                    and higher strain of law and politics, no one has ever yetuttered 
                    any prelude, or composed or published any, as though there 
                    wasno such thing in nature. Whereas our present discussion 
                    seems to me toimply that there is;-these double laws, of which 
                    we were speaking, arenot exactly double, but they are in two 
                    parts, the law and the preludeof the law. The arbitrary command, 
                    which was compared to thecommands of doctors, whom we described 
                    as of the meaner sort, wasthe law pure and simple; and that 
                    which preceded, and was described byour friend here as being 
                    hortatory only, was, although in fact, anexhortation, likewise 
                    analogous to the preamble of a discourse. ForI imagine that 
                    all this language of conciliation, which the legislatorhas 
                    been uttering in the preface of the law, was intended to creategoodwill 
                    in the person whom he addressed, in order that, by reasonof 
                    this good-will, he might more intelligently receive his command,that 
                    is to say, the law. And therefore, in my way of speaking, 
                    this ismore rightly described as the preamble than as the 
                    matter of thelaw. And I must further proceed to observe, that 
                    to all his laws,and to each separately, the legislator should 
                    prefix a preamble; heshould remember how great will be the 
                    difference between them,according as they have, or have not, 
                    such preambles, as in the casealready given.</p>
                  <p>Cle. The lawgiver, if he asks my opinion, will certainly 
                    legislatein the form which you advise.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I think that you are right, Cleinias, in affirming that 
                    alllaws have preambles, and that throughout the whole of this 
                    work oflegislation every single law should have a suitable 
                    preamble at thebeginning; for that which is to follow is most 
                    important, and it makesall the difference whether we clearly 
                    remember the preambles or not.Yet we should be wrong in requiring 
                    that all laws, small and greatalike, should have preambles 
                    of the same kind, any more than all songsor speeches; although 
                    they may be natural to all, they are notalways necessary, 
                    and whether they are to be employed or not has ineach case 
                    to be left to the judgment of the speaker or the musician,or, 
                    in the present instance, of the lawgiver.</p>
                  <p>Cle. That I think is most true. And now, Stranger, without 
                    delay letus return to the argument, and, as people say in 
                    play, make a secondand better beginning, if you please, with 
                    the principles which we havebeen laying down, which we never 
                    thought of regarding as a preamblebefore, but of which we 
                    may now make a preamble, and not merelyconsider them to be 
                    chance topics of discourse. Let us acknowledge,then, that 
                    we have a preamble. About the honour of the Gods and therespect 
                    of parents, enough has been already said; and we may proceedto 
                    the topics which follow next in order, until the preamble 
                    is deemedby you to be complete; and after that you shall go 
                    through the lawsthemselves.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I understand you to mean that we have made a sufficientpreamble 
                    about Gods and demi-gods, and about parents living or dead;and 
                    now you would have us bring the rest of the subject into the 
                    lightof day?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Exactly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. After this, as is meet and for the interest of us all, 
                    I thespeaker, and you the listeners, will try to estimate 
                    all thatrelates to the souls and bodies and properties of 
                    the citizens, asregards both their occupations and arrive, 
                    as far as in us lies, atthe nature of education. These then 
                    are the topics which follow nextin order.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good.</p>

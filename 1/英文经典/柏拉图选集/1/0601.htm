                    <br>
                    by Plato<br>
                    <br>
                    translated by <b><i>Benjamin Jowett</i></b></p>

                  <p><br>
                    PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: THEODORUS; SOCRATES; THE ELEATIC 
                    <br>
                    STRANGER; THE YOUNGER SOCRATES</p>
                  <p> Socrates. I owe you many thanks, indeed, Theodorus, for 
                    the<br>
                    acquaintance both of Theaetetus and of the Stranger.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theodorus. And in a little while, Socrates, you will owe 
                    me three<br>
                    times as many, when they have completed for you the <br>
                    delineation of the Statesman and of the Philosopher, as well 
                    as of the Sophist.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soc. Sophist, statesman, philosopher! O my dear Theodorus, 
                    do my<br>
                    ears truly witness that this is the estimate formed of them 
                    by the<br>
                    great calculator and geometrician?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theod. What do you mean, Socrates?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soc. I mean that you rate them all at the same value, whereas 
                    they<br>
                    are really separated by an interval, which no geometrical 
                    ratio can<br>
                    express.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theod. By Ammon, the god of Cyrene, Socrates, that is a very 
                    fair<br>
                    hit; and shows that you have not forgotten your geometry. 
                    I will<br>
                    retaliate on you at some other time, but I must now ask the<br>
                    Stranger, who will not, I hope, tire of his goodness to us, 
                    <br>
                    to proceed either with the Statesman or with the Philosopher, 
                    whichever he prefers.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Stranger. That is my duty, Theodorus; having begun I must 
                    <br>
                    go on, and not leave the work unfinished. But what shall be 
                    done with <br>
                    Theaetetus?</p>
                  <p> Theod. In what respect?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Shall we relieve him, and take his companion, the Young<br>
                    Socrates, instead of him? What do you advise?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theod. Yes, give the other a turn, as you propose. The young<br>
                    always do better when they have intervals of rest.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soc. I think, Stranger, that both of them may be said to 
                    be in<br>
                    some way related to me; for the one, as you affirm, has the 
                    cut of<br>
                    my ugly face, the other is called by my name. And we should 
                    always<br>
                    be on the look-out to recognize a kinsman by the style of 
                    his<br>
                    conversation. I myself was discoursing with Theaetetus yesterday,<br>
                    and I have just been listening to his answers; my namesake 
                    I have<br>
                    not yet examined, but I must. Another time will, do for me; 
                    <br>
                    to-day let him answer you.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Very good. Young Socrates, do you hear what the elder<br>
                    Socrates is proposing?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Young Socrates. I do.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And do you agree to his proposal?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. As you do not object, still less can I. After the Sophist,<br>
                    then, I think that the Statesman naturally follows next in 
                    the order<br>
                    of enquiry. And please to say, whether he, too, should be 
                    <br>
                    ranked among those who have science.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then the sciences must be divided as before?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I dare say.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But yet the division will not be the same?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How then?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. They will be divided at some other point.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Where shall we discover the path of the Statesman? We 
                    <br>
                    must find and separate off, and set our seal upon this, and 
                    we will <br>
                    set the mark of another class upon all diverging paths. Thus 
                    the soul <br>
                    will conceive of ail kinds of knowledge under two classes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. To find the path is your business, Stranger, and 
                    not mine.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes, Socrates, but the discovery, when once made, <br>
                    must be yours as well as mine.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Well, and are not arithmetic and certain other kindred 
                    arts,<br>
                    merely abstract knowledge, wholly separated from action?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But in the art of carpentering and all other handicrafts, 
                    the<br>
                    knowledge of the workman is merged in his work; he not only 
                    <br>
                    knows, but he also makes things which previously did not exist.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then let us divide sciences in general into those which 
                    are<br>
                    practical and those which are-purely intellectual.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Let us assume these two divisions of science, which 
                    is one<br>
                    whole.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And are &quot;statesman,&quot; &quot;king,&quot; &quot;master,&quot; 
                    or &quot;householder,&quot; one<br>
                    and the same; or is there a science or art answering to each 
                    of<br>
                    these names? Or rather, allow me to put the matter in another 
                    way.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Let me hear.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. If any one who is in a private station has the skill 
                    to<br>
                    advise one of the public physicians, must not he also be called 
                    a<br>
                    physician?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And if any one who is in a private station is able to 
                    advise<br>
                    the ruler of a country, may not he be said to have the <br>
                    knowledge which the ruler himself ought to have?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But, surely the science of a true king is royal science?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And will not he who possesses this knowledge, whether 
                    he<br>
                    happens to be a ruler or a private man, when regarded only 
                    in<br>
                    reference to his art, be truly called &quot;royal&quot;?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. He certainly ought to be.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the householder and master are the same?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Of course.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Again, a large household may be compared to a small 
                    <br>
                    state:-will they differ at all, as far as government is concerned?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. They will not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then, returning to the point which we were just now 
                    <br>
                    discussing, do we not clearly see that there is one science 
                    of all of them; and this science may be called either royal 
                    or political or <br>
                    economical; we will not quarrel with any one about the name.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. This too, is evident, that the king cannot do much with 
                    his<br>
                    hands, or with his whole body, towards the maintenance of 
                    his<br>
                    empire, compared with what he does by the intelligence and 
                    <br>
                    strength of his mind.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Clearly not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then, shall we say that the king has a greater affinity 
                    to<br>
                    knowledge than to manual arts and to practical life in general?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly he has.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then we may put all together as one and the<br>
                    same-statesmanship and the statesman-the kingly science and 
                    the king.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Clearly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And now we shall only be proceeding in due order if 
                    <br>
                    we go on to divide the sphere of knowledge?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Think whether you can find any joint or parting in knowledge.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Tell me of what sort.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Such as this: You may remember that we made an art of<br>
                    calculation?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Which was, unmistakably, one of the arts of knowledge?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And to this art of calculation which discerns the differences<br>
                    of numbers shall we assign any other function except to pass<br>
                    judgment on their differences?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How could we?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You know that the master-builder does not work himself, 
                    but<br>
                    is the ruler of workmen?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. He contributes knowledge, not manual labour?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And may therefore be justly said to share in theoretical<br>
                    science?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But he ought not, like the calculator, to regard his<br>
                    functions as at and when he has formed a judgment;-he must 
                    assign to the individual workmen their appropriate task until 
                    they have<br>
                    completed the work.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Are not all such sciences, no less than arithmetic and 
                    the<br>
                    like, subjects of pure knowledge; and is not the difference 
                    between<br>
                    the two classes, that the one sort has the power of judging 
                    only,<br>
                    and the other of ruling as well?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. That is evident.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. May we not very properly say, that of all knowledge, 
                    there<br>
                    are there are two divisions-one which rules, and the other 
                    which<br>
                    judges?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I should think so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And when men have anything to do in common, that they 
                    <br>
                    should be of one mind is surely a desirable thing?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then while we are at unity among ourselves, we need 
                    not mind<br>
                    about the fancies of others?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And now, in which of these divisions shall we place 
                    the<br>
                    king?-Is he a judge and a kind of spectator? Or shall we <br>
                    assign to him the art of command-for he is a ruler?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. The latter, clearly.</p>
                  <p> Str. Then we must see whether there is any mark of division 
                    in the<br>
                    art of command too. I am inclined to think that there is a 
                    <br>
                    distinction similar to that of manufacturer and retail dealer, 
                    which <br>
                    parts off the king from the herald.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How is this?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Why, does not the retailer receive and sell over again 
                    the<br>
                    productions of others, which have been sold before?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly he does.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And is not the herald under command, and does he not 
                    receive<br>
                    orders, and in his turn give them to others?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then shall we mingle the kingly art in the same class 
                    with<br>
                    the art of the herald, the interpreter, the boatswain, the 
                    prophet,<br>
                    and the numerous kindred arts which exercise command; or, 
                    as in the<br>
                    preceding comparison we spoke of manufacturers, or sellers 
                    for<br>
                    themselves, and of retailers,-seeing, too, that the class 
                    of supreme<br>
                    rulers, or rulers for themselves, is almost nameless-shall 
                    we make a<br>
                    word following the same analogy, and refer kings to a supreme 
                    or<br>
                    ruling-for-self science, leaving the rest to receive a name 
                    from<br>
                    some one else? For we are seeking the ruler; and our enquiry 
                    is not<br>
                    concerned with him who is not a ruler.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Thus a very fair distinction has been attained between 
                    the<br>
                    man who gives his own commands, and him who gives another's. 
                    And now let us see if the supreme power allows of any further 
                    division.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. By all means.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I think that it does; and please to assist me in making 
                    the<br>
                    division.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. At what point?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. May not all rulers be supposed to command for the sake 
                    of<br>
                    producing something?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Nor is there any difficulty in dividing the things produced<br>
                    into two classes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How would you divide them?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Of the whole class some have life and some are without 
                    life.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And by the help of this distinction we may make, if 
                    we<br>
                    please, a subdivision of the section of knowledge which commands.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. At what point?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. One part may be set over the production of lifeless, 
                    the<br>
                    other of living objects; and in this way the whole will be 
                    divided.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. That division, then, is complete; and now we may leave 
                    one<br>
                    half, and take up the other; which may also be divided into 
                    two.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Which of the two halves do you men?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Of course that which exercises command about animals. 
                    For,<br>
                    surely, the royal science is not like that of a master-workman, 
                    a<br>
                    science presiding over lifeless objects;-the king has a nobler<br>
                    function, which is the management and control of living beings.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the breeding and tending of living beings may be 
                    observed<br>
                    to be sometimes a tending of the individual; in other cases, 
                    a<br>
                    common care of creatures in flocks?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But the statesman is not a tender of individuals-not 
                    like the<br>
                    driver or groom of a single ox or horse; he is rather to be 
                    compared<br>
                    with the keeper of a drove of horses or oxen.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes, I see, thanks to you.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Shall we call this art of tending many animals together, 
                    the<br>
                    art of managing a herd, or the art of collective management?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. No matter;-Whichever suggests itself to us in the 
                    course<br>
                    of conversation.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Very good, Socrates; and, if you continue to be not 
                    too<br>
                    particular about names, you will be all the richer in wisdom 
                    when<br>
                    you are an old man. And now, as you say, leaving the <br>
                    discussion of the name, -can you see a way in which a person, 
                    by showing the art of herding to be of two kinds, may cause 
                    that which is now sought amongst twice the number of things, 
                    to be then sought amongst half that number?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I will try;-there appears to me to be one management 
                    of<br>
                    men and another of beasts.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You have certainly divided them in a most straightforward 
                    and<br>
                    manly style; but you have fallen into an error which hereafter 
                    I think<br>
                    that we had better avoid.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What is the error?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I think that we had better not cut off a single small 
                    portion<br>
                    which is not a species, from many larger portions; the part 
                    should<br>
                    be a species. To separate off at once the subject of investigation, 
                    is<br>
                    a most excellent plan, if only the separation be rightly <br>
                    made; and you were under the impression that you were right, 
                    because you saw that you would come to man; and this led you 
                    to hasten the steps. But you should not chip off too small 
                    a piece, my friend; the safer way is to cut through the middle; 
                    which is also the more likely way of finding classes. Attention 
                    to this principle makes all the difference in a process of 
                    enquiry.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What do you mean, Stranger?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I will endeavour to speak more plainly out of love to 
                    <br>
                    your good parts, Socrates; and, although I cannot at present 
                    entirely explain myself, I will try, as we proceed, to make 
                    my meaning a little<br>
                    clearer.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What was the error of which, as you say, we were 
                    guilty in<br>
                    our recent division?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The error was just as if some one who wanted to divide 
                    the<br>
                    human race, were to divide them after the fashion which prevails 
                    in<br>
                    this part of the world; here they cut off the Hellenes as 
                    <br>
                    one species, and all the other species of mankind, which are 
                    innumerable, and have no ties or common language, they include 
                    under the single name of &quot;barbarians,&quot; and because 
                    they have one name they are supposed to be of one species 
                    also. Or suppose that in dividing numbers you were to cut 
                    off ten thousand from all the rest, and make of it one species, 
                    comprehending the first under another separate name, you might 
                    say that here too was a single class, because you had given 
                    it a single name. Whereas you would make a much better and 
                    more equal and logical classification of numbers, if you divided 
                    them into odd and even; or of the human species, if you divided 
                    them into male and female; and only separated off Lydians 
                    or Phrygians, or any other tribe, and arrayed them against 
                    the rest of the world, when you could no longer make a division 
                    into parts which were also classes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true; but I wish that this distinction between 
                    a part<br>
                    and a class could still be made somewhat plainer.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. O Socrates, best of men, you are imposing upon me a 
                    very<br>
                    difficult task. We have already digressed further from our 
                    original<br>
                    intention than we ought, and you would have us wander still 
                    further<br>
                    away. But we must now return to our subject; and hereafter, 
                    <br>
                    when there is a leisure hour, we will follow up the other 
                    track; at the <br>
                    same time I wish you to guard against imagining that you ever 
                    heard me declare-<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. That a class and a part are distinct.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What did I hear, then?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. That a class is necessarily a part, but there is no 
                    similar<br>
                    necessity that a part should be a dass; that is the view which 
                    I<br>
                    should always wish you to attribute to me, Socrates.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. So be it.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is another thing which I should like to know.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What is it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The point at which we digressed; for, if I am not <br>
                    mistaken, the exact place was at the question, Where you would 
                    divide the management of herds. To this you appeared rather 
                    too ready to answer that them were two species of animals; 
                    man being one, and all brutes making up the other.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I thought that in taking away a part you imagined that 
                    the<br>
                    remainder formed a class, because you were able to call them 
                    by the<br>
                    common name of brutes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. That again is true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Suppose now, O most courageous of dialecticians, that 
                    <br>
                    some wise and understanding creature, such as a crane is reputed 
                    to <br>
                    be, were, in imitation of you, to make a similar division, 
                    and set up cranes against all other animals to their own special 
                    glorification, at the same time jumbling together all the 
                    others, including man, under the appellation of brutes,-here 
                    would be the sort of error which we must try to avoid.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How can we be safe?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. If we do not divide the whole class of animals, we shall 
                    be<br>
                    less likely to fall into that error.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. We had better not take the whole?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes, there lay the source of error in our former division.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You remember how that part of the art of knowledge which 
                    was<br>
                    concerned with command, had to do with the rearing of living<br>
                    creatures,-I mean, with animals in herds?</p>
                  <p> Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. In that case, there was already implied a division of 
                    all<br>
                    animals into tame and wild; those whose nature can be tamed 
                    <br>
                    are called tame, and those which cannot be tamed are called 
                    wild.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the political science of which we are in search, 
                    is and<br>
                    ever was concerned with tame animals, and is also confined 
                    to<br>
                    gregarious animals.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But then ought not to divide, as we did, taking the 
                    <br>
                    whole class at once. Neither let us be in too great haste 
                    to arrive <br>
                    quickly at the political science; for this mistake has already 
                    brought upon us the misfortune of which the proverb speaks.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What misfortune?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The misfortune of too much haste, which is too little 
                    speed.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. And all the better, Stranger;-we got what we deserved.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Very well: Let us then begin again, and endeavour to 
                    <br>
                    divide the collective rearing of animals; for probably the 
                    completion of the argument will best show what you are so 
                    anxious to know. Tell me, then-<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Have you ever heard, as you very likely may-for I do 
                    not<br>
                    suppose that you ever actually visited them-of the preserves 
                    <br>
                    of fishes in the Nile, and in the ponds of the Great King; 
                    or you may have seen similar preserves in wells at home?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes, to be sure, I have seen them, and I have often 
                    heard<br>
                    the others described.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And you may have heard also, and may have been-assured 
                    by<br>
                    report, although you have not travelled in those regions, 
                    of <br>
                    nurseries of geese and cranes in the plains of Thessaly?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I asked you, because here is a new division of the management<br>
                    of herds, into the management of land and of water herds.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. There is.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And do you agree that we ought to divide the collective 
                    rearing<br>
                    of herds into two corresponding parts, the one the rearing 
                    of water,<br>
                    and the other the rearing of land herds?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is surely no need to ask which of these two contains<br>
                    the royal art, for it is evident to everybody.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Any one can divide the herds which feed on dry land?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How would you divide them?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I should distinguish between those which fly and those 
                    which<br>
                    walk.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Most true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And where shall we look for the political animal? Might 
                    not<br>
                    an idiot, so to speak, know that he is a pedestrian?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The art of managing the walking animal has to be further<br>
                    divided, just as you might have an even number.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Clearly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let me note that here appear in view two ways to that 
                    part or<br>
                    class which the argument aims at reaching-the one is speedier 
                    way,<br>
                    which cuts off a small portion and leaves a large; the other 
                    agrees<br>
                    better with the principle which we were laying down, that 
                    as <br>
                    far as we can we should divide in the middle; but it is longer. 
                    We can take either of them, whichever we please.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Cannot we have both ways?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Together? What a thing to ask! but, if you take them 
                    in turn,<br>
                    you clearly may.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Then I should like to have them in turn.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There will be no difficulty, as we are near the end; 
                    if we<br>
                    had been at the beginning, or in the middle, I should have 
                    <br>
                    demurred to your request; but now, in accordance with your 
                    desire, let us begin with the longer way; while we are fresh, 
                    we shall get on better. And now attend to the division.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Let me hear.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The tame walking herding animals are distributed by 
                    <br>
                    nature into two classes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Upon what principle?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The one grows horns; and the other is without horns.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Clearly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Suppose that you divide the science which manages pedestrian<br>
                    animals into two corresponding parts, and define them; for 
                    if you<br>
                    try to invent names for them, you will find the intricacy 
                    too great.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How must I speak of them, then?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. In this way: let the science of managing pedestrian 
                    animals<br>
                    be divided into two parts and one part assigned to the <br>
                    horned herd and the other to the herd that has no horns.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. All that you say has been abundantly proved, and 
                    may<br>
                    therefore, be assumed.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The king is clearly the shepherd a polled herd, who 
                    have no<br>
                    horns.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. That is evident.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Shall we break up this hornless herd into sections, 
                    and<br>
                    endeavour to assign to him what is his?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. By all means.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Shall we distinguish them by their having or not having<br>
                    cloven feet, or by their mixing or not mixing the breed? You 
                    <br>
                    know what I mean.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I mean that horses and asses naturally breed from one 
                    another.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But the remainder of the hornless herd of tame <br>
                    animals will not mix the breed.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And of which has the Statesman charge,-of the mixed 
                    or of the<br>
                    unmixed race?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Clearly of the unmixed.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I suppose that we must divide this again as before.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. We must.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Every tame and herding animal has now been split up, 
                    with the<br>
                    exception of two species; for I hardly think that dogs should 
                    be<br>
                    reckoned among gregarious animals.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly not; but how shall we divide the two remaining<br>
                    species?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is a measure of difference which may be appropriately<br>
                    employed by you and Theaetetus, who are students of geometry.<br>

                  <p>Y. Soc. Indeed I should.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And there is a still more ridiculous consequence, <br>
                    that the king is found running about with the herd and in 
                    close <br>
                    competition with the bird-catcher, who of all mankind is most 
                    of an adept at the airy life.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then here, Socrates, is still clearer evidence of the 
                    truth<br>
                    of what was said in the enquiry about the Sophist?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. That the dialectical method is no respecter of persons, 
                    and<br>
                    does not set the great above the small, but always arrives 
                    in her<br>
                    own way at the truest result.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Clearly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And now, I will not wait for you to ask the, but will 
                    <br>
                    of my own accord take you by the shorter road to the definition 
                    of a king.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. By all means.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I say that we should have begun at first by dividing 
                    land<br>
                    animals into biped and quadruped; and since the winged herd, 
                    and<br>
                    that alone, comes out in the same class with man, should <br>
                    divide bipeds into those which have feathers and those which 
                    have not, and when they have been divided, and the art of 
                    the management of mankind is brought to light, the time will 
                    have come to produce our Statesman and ruler, and set him 
                    like a charioteer in his place, and hand over to him the reins 
                    of state, for that too is a vocation which belongs to him.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very good; you have paid me the debt-I mean, that 
                    you have<br>
                    completed the argument, and I suppose that you added the <br>
                    digression by way of interest.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then now, let us go back to the beginning, and join 
                    the<br>
                    links, which together make the definition of the name of the<br>
                    Statesman's art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. By all means.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The science of pure knowledge had, as we said originally, 
                    a<br>
                    part which was the science of rule or command, and from this 
                    was<br>
                    derived another part, which was called command-for-self, on 
                    the<br>
                    analogy of selling-for-self; an important section of this 
                    was the<br>
                    management of living animals, and this again was further limited 
                    to<br>
                    the manage merit of them in herds; and again in herds of pedestrian<br>
                    animals. The chief division of the latter was the art of managing<br>
                    pedestrian animals which are without horns; this again has 
                    a part<br>
                    which can only be comprehended under one term by joining together<br>
                    three names-shepherding pure-bred animals. The only further<br>
                    subdivision is the art of man herding-this has to do with 
                    bipeds,<br>
                    and is what we were seeking after, and have now found, being 
                    at once<br>
                    the royal and political.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. To be sure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And do you think, Socrates, that we really have done 
                    as you<br>
                    say?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Do you think, I mean, that we have really fulfilled 
                    our<br>
                    intention?-There has been a sort of discussion, and yet the<br>
                    investigation seems to me not to be perfectly worked out: 
                    this is<br>
                    where the enquiry fails.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I do not understand.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I will try to make the thought, which is at this <br>
                    moment present in my mind, clearer to us both.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Let me hear.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There were many arts of shepherding, and one of them 
                    was the<br>
                    political, which had the charge of one particular herd?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And this the argument defined to be the art of rearing, 
                    not<br>
                    horses or other brutes, but the art of rearing man collectively?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Note, however, a difference which distinguishes the 
                    king from<br>
                    all other shepherds.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. To what do you refer?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I want to ask, whether any one of the other herdsmen 
                    has a<br>
                    rival who professes and claims to share with him in the management<br>
                    of the herd?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I mean to say that merchants husbandmen, providers of 
                    <br>
                    food, and also training-masters and physicians, will all contend 
                    with the herdsmen of humanity, whom we call Statesmen, declaring 
                    that they themselves have the care of rearing of managing 
                    mankind, and <br>
                    that they rear not only the common herd, but also the rulers 
                    themselves.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Are they not right in saying so?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Very likely they may be, and we will consider their 
                    claim.<br>
                    But we are certain of this,-that no one will raise a similar 
                    claim<br>
                    as against the herdsman, who is allowed on all hands to be 
                    the sole<br>
                    and only feeder and physician of his herd; he is also their 
                    <br>
                    matchmaker and accoucheur; no one else knows that department 
                    of science. And he is their merry-maker and musician, as far 
                    as their nature is susceptible of such influences, and no 
                    one can console and soothe his own herd better than he can, 
                    either with the natural tones of<br>
                    his voice or with instruments. And the same may be said of 
                    tenders<br>
                    of animals in general.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But if this is as you say, can our argument about the 
                    king be<br>
                    true and unimpeachable? Were we right in selecting him out 
                    of ten<br>
                    thousand other claimants to be the shepherd and rearer of 
                    the human<br>
                    flock?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Surely not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Had we not reason just to now apprehend, that although 
                    we may<br>
                    have described a sort of royal form, we have not as yet accurately<br>
                    worked out the true image of the Statesman? and that we cannot<br>
                    reveal him as he truly is in his own nature, until we have<br>
                    disengaged and separated him from those who bang about him 
                    and claim to share in his prerogatives?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And that, Socrates, is what we must do, if we do not 
                    mean to<br>
                    bring disgrace upon the argument at its close.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. We must certainly avoid that.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then let us make a new beginning, and travel by a different<br>
                    road.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What road?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I think that we may have a little amusement; there is 
                    a<br>
                    famous tale, of which a good portion may with advantage be 
                    <br>
                    interwoven, and then we may resume our series of divisions, 
                    and proceed in the old path until we arrive at the desired 
                    summit. Shall we do as I say?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. By all means.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Listen, then, to a tale which a child would love to 
                    hear; and<br>
                    you are not too old for childish amusement.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Let me hear.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There did really happen, and will again happen, like 
                    <br>
                    many other events of which ancient tradition has preserved 
                    the record, the portent which is traditionally said to have 
                    occurred in the <br>
                    quarrel of Atreus and Thyestes. You have heard no doubt, and 
                    remember what they say happened at that time?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I suppose you to mean the token of the birth of the 
                    golden<br>
                    lamb.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. No, not that; but another part of the story, which tells 
                    how<br>
                    the sun and the stars once rose in the west, and set in the 
                    east,<br>
                    and that the god reversed their motion, and gave them that 
                    which<br>
                    they now have as a testimony to the right of Atreus.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes; there is that legend also.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Again, we have been often told of the reign of Cronos.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes, very often.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Did you ever hear that the men of former times were<br>
                    earthborn, and not begotten of one another?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes, that is another old tradition.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. All these stories, and ten thousand others which are 
                    <br>
                    still more wonderful, have a common origin; many of them have 
                    been lost in the lapse of ages, or are repeated only in a 
                    disconnected form; but the origin of them is what no one has 
                    told, and may as well be told now; for the tale is suited 
                    to throw light on the nature of the king.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very good; and I hope that you will give the whole 
                    story,<br>
                    and leave out nothing.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Listen, then. There is a time when God himself guides 
                    <br>
                    and helps to roll the world in its course; and there is a 
                    time, on the<br>
                    completion of a certain cycle, when he lets go, and the world 
                    being<br>
                    a living creature, and having originally received intelligence 
                    from<br>
                    its author and creator turns about and by an inherent necessity<br>
                    revolves in the opposite direction.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Why is that?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Why, because only the most divine things of all remain 
                    ever<br>
                    unchanged and the same, and body is not included in this <br>
                    class. Heaven and the universe, as we have termed them, although 
                    they have been endowed by the Creator with many glories, partake 
                    of a bodily nature, and therefore cannot be entirely free 
                    from perturbation. But their motion is, as far as possible, 
                    single and in the same place, and of the same kind; and is 
                    therefore only subject to a reversal, which is the least alteration 
                    possible. For the lord of all moving things is alone able 
                    to move of himself; and to think that he moves them at one 
                    time in one direction and at another time in another is blasphemy.<br>
                    Hence we must not say that the world is either self-moved 
                    always, or<br>
                    all made to go round by God in two opposite courses; or that 
                    <br>
                    two Gods,<br>
                    having opposite purposes, make it move round. But as I have 
                    already<br>
                    said (and this is the only remaining alternative) the world 
                    is<br>
                    guided at one time by an external power which is divine and 
                    receives<br>
                    fresh life and immortality from the renewing hand of the Creator,<br>
                    and again, when let go, moves spontaneously, being set free 
                    at such<br>
                    a time as to have, during infinite cycles of years, a reverse<br>
                    movement: this is due to its perfect balance, to its vast 
                    <br>
                    size, and to the fact that it turns on the smallest pivot.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Your account of the world seems to be very reasonable<br>
                    indeed.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us now reflect and try to gather from what has been 
                    said<br>
                    the nature of the phenomenon which we affirmed to be the cause 
                    of<br>
                    all these wonders. It is this.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The reversal which takes place from time to time of 
                    the<br>
                    motion of the universe.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How is that the cause?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Of all changes of the heavenly motions, we may <br>
                    consider this to be the greatest and most complete.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I should imagine so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And it may be supposed to result in the greatest <br>
                    changes to the human beings who are the inhabitants of the 
                    world at the time.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Such changes would naturally occur.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And animals, as we know, survive with difficulty great 
                    and<br>
                    serious changes of many different kinds when they come upon 
                    them at once.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Hence there necessarily occurs a great destruction of 
                    them,<br>
                    which extends also to-the life of man; few survivors of the 
                    race are<br>
                    left, and those who remain become the subjects of several 
                    novel and<br>
                    remarkable phenomena, and of one in particular, which takes 
                    place at<br>
                    the time when the transition is made to the cycle opposite 
                    to that<br>
                    in which we are now living.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What is it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The life of all animals first came to a standstill, 
                    and the<br>
                    mortal nature ceased to be or look older, and was then reversed 
                    and<br>
                    grew young and delicate; the white locks of the aged darkened 
                    again,<br>
                    and the cheeks the bearded man became smooth, and recovered 
                    their<br>
                    former bloom; the bodies of youths in their prime grew softer 
                    and<br>
                    smaller, continually by day and night returning and becoming<br>
                    assimilated to the nature of a newly-born child in mind as 
                    well as<br>
                    body; in the succeeding stage they wasted away and wholly 
                    <br>
                    disappeared.<br>
                    And the bodies of those who died by violence at that time 
                    quickly<br>
                    passed through the like changes, and in a few days were no 
                    more seen.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Then how, Stranger, were the animals created in those<br>
                    days; and in what way were they begotten of one another?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. It is evident, Socrates, that there was no such thing 
                    in the<br>
                    then order of nature as the procreation of animals from one 
                    another;<br>
                    the earth-born race, of which we hear in story, was the one 
                    which<br>
                    existed in those days-they rose again from the ground; and 
                    of this<br>
                    tradition, which is now-a-days often unduly discredited, our<br>
                    ancestors, who were nearest in point of time to the end of 
                    the last<br>
                    period and came into being at the beginning of this, are to 
                    us the<br>
                    heralds. And mark how consistent the sequel of the tale is; 
                    after<br>
                    the return of age to youth, follows the return of the dead, 
                    who are<br>
                    lying in the earth, to life; simultaneously with the reversal 
                    of the<br>
                    world the wheel of their generation has been turned back, 
                    <br>
                    and they are put together and rise and live in the opposite 
                    order, unless God has carried any of them away to some other 
                    lot. According to this tradition they of necessity sprang 
                    from the earth and have the name of earth-born, and so the 
                    above legend clings to them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly that is quite consistent with what has 
                    preceded;<br>
                    but tell me, was the life which you said existed in the reign 
                    of<br>
                    Cronos in that cycle of the world, or in this? For the change 
                    in the<br>
                    course of the stars and the sun must have occurred in both.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I see that you enter into my meaning;-no, that blessed 
                    and<br>
                    spontaneous life does not belong to the present cycle of the 
                    world,<br>
                    but to the previous one, in which God superintended the whole<br>
                    revolution of the universe; and the several parts the universe 
                    were<br>
                    distributed under the rule. certain inferior deities, as is 
                    the way in some places still There were demigods, who were 
                    the shepherds of the various species and herds of animals, 
                    and each one was in <br>
                    all respects sufficient for those of whom he was the shepherd; 
                    neither was there any violence, or devouring of one another 
                    or war or quarrel among them; and I might tell of ten thousand 
                    other blessings, <br>
                    which belonged to that dispensation. The reason why the life 
                    of man was, as tradition says, spontaneous, is as follows: 
                    In those days God himself was their shepherd, and ruled over 
                    them, just as man, over them, who is by comparison a divine 
                    being, still rules over the lower animals. Under him there 
                    were no forms of government or separate possession of women 
                    and children; for all men rose again from the earth, having 
                    no memory, of the past. And although they had nothing of this 
                    sort, the earth gave them fruits in abundance, which grew 
                    on trees and shrubs unbidden, and were not planted by the 
                    hand of man. And they dwelt naked, and mostly in the open 
                    air, for the temperature of their seasons, was mild; and they 
                    had no beds, but lay on Soft couches of grass, which grew 
                    plentifully out of: the earth. Such was the life of man in 
                    the days of Cronos, Socrates; the character of our present 
                    life which is said to be under Zeus, you know from your own<br>
                    experience. Can you, and will you, determine which of them 
                    you deem the happier?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Impossible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then shall I determine for you as well as I can?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. By all means.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Suppose that the nurslings of Cronos, having this boundless<br>
                    leisure, and the power of holding intercourse, not only with 
                    men,<br>
                    but with the brute creation, had used all these advantages 
                    <br>
                    with a view to philosophy, conversing with the brutes as well 
                    as with <br>
                    one another, and learning of every nature which was gifted 
                    with any special power, and was able to contribute some special 
                    experience to <br>
                    the store of wisdom there would be no difficulty in deciding 
                    that they would be a thousand times happier than the men of 
                    our own day. Or, <br>
                    again, if they had merely eaten and drunk until they were 
                    full, and <br>
                    told stories to one another and to the animals-such stories 
                    as are now attributed to them-in this case also, as I should 
                    imagine, the answer would be easy. But until some satisfactory 
                    witness can be found of the love of that age for knowledge 
                    and: discussion, we had better let the matter drop, and give 
                    the reason why we have unearthed this tale,<br>
                    and then we shall be able to get on. In the fulness of time, 
                    when the change was to take place, and the earth-born race 
                    had all perished, and every soul had completed its proper 
                    cycle of births and been sown in the earth her appointed number 
                    of times, the pilot of the universe let the helm go, and retired 
                    to his place of view; and then Fate and innate desire reversed 
                    the motion of the world. Then also all the inferior deities 
                    who share the rule of the supreme power, being informed of 
                    what was happening, let go the parts of the world which were 
                    under their control. And the world turning round with a sudden 
                    shock, being impelled in an opposite direction from beginning 
                    to end, was shaken by a mighty earthquake, which wrought a 
                    new destruction of all manner of animals. <br>
                    Afterwards, when sufficient time had elapsed, the tumult and 
                    confusion and earthquake ceased, and the universal creature, 
                    once more at peace attained to a calm, and settle down into 
                    his own orderly and accustomed course, having the charge and 
                    rule of himself and of all the creatures which are contained 
                    in him, and executing, as far as<br>
                    he remembered them, the instructions of his Father and Creator, 
                    more<br>
                    precisely at first, but afterwords with less exactness. The 
                    reason<br>
                    of the falling off was the admixture of matter in him; this 
                    was<br>
                    inherent in the primal nature, which was full of disorder, 
                    until<br>
                    attaining to the present order. From God, the constructor; 
                    the world<br>
                    received all that is good in him, but from a previous state 
                    came<br>
                    elements of evil and unrighteousness, which, thence derived, 
                    first<br>
                    of all passed into the world, and were then transmitted to 
                    the<br>
                    animals. While the world was aided by the pilot in nurturing 
                    the<br>
                    animals, the evil was small, and great the good which he <br>
                    produced, but after the separation, when the world was let 
                    go, at first all proceeded well enough; but, as time went 
                    there was more and more forgetting, and the old discord again 
                    held sway and burst forth in full glory; and at last small 
                    was the good, and great was the<br>
                    admixture of evil, and there was a danger of universal ruin 
                    to the<br>
                    world, and the things contained in him. Wherefore God, the 
                    orderer<br>
                    of all, in his tender care, seeing that the world was in great<br>
                    straits, and fearing that all might be dissolved in the storm 
                    and<br>
                    disappear in infinite chaos, again seated himself at the helm; 
                    and<br>
                    bringing back the elements which had fallen into dissolution 
                    and<br>
                    disorder to the motion which had prevailed under his dispensation,<br>
                    he set them in order and restored them, and made the world<br>
                    imperishable and immortal.<br>
                    And this is the whole tale, of which the first part will suffice<br>
                    to illustrate the nature of the king. For when the world turned<br>
                    towards the present cycle of generation, the age of man again 
                    stood<br>
                    still, and a change opposite to the previous one was the result. 
                    The<br>
                    small creatures which had almost disappeared grew in and stature,<br>
                    and the newly-born children of the earth became grey and <br>
                    died and sank into the earth again. All things changed, imitating 
                    and following the condition of the universe, and of necessity 
                    agreeing with that in their mode of conception and generation 
                    and nurture; for <br>
                    no animal; was any longer allowed to come into being in the 
                    earth through the agency of other creative beings, but as 
                    the world was ordained to be the lord of his own progress, 
                    in like manner the parts were ordained to grow and generate 
                    and give nourishment, as far as they could, of themselves, 
                    impelled by a similar movement. And so we have arrived at 
                    the real end of this discourse; for although there might be 
                    much to tell of the lower animals, and of the condition out 
                    of which they changed and of the causes of the change, about 
                    men there is not much, and that little is more to the purpose. 
                    Deprived of the care of God, who had possessed and tended 
                    them, they were left <br>
                    helpless and defenceless, and were torn in pieces by the beasts, 
                    who were naturally fierce and had now grown wild. And in the 
                    first ages they were still without skill or resource; the 
                    food which once grew<br>
                    spontaneously had failed, and as yet they knew not how to 
                    procure<br>
                    it, because they-had never felt the pressure of necessity. 
                    For all<br>
                    these reasons they were in a great strait; wherefore also 
                    the gifts<br>
                    spoken of in the old tradition were imparted to man by the 
                    gods,<br>
                    together with so much teaching and education as was indispensable;<br>
                    fire was given to them by Prometheus, the arts by Hephaestus 
                    and his<br>
                    fellow-worker, Athene, seeds and plants by others. From these 
                    is<br>
                    derived all that has helped to frame human life; since the 
                    <br>
                    care of the Gods, as I was saying, had now failed men, and 
                    they had to order their course of life for themselves, and 
                    were their own masters, just like the universal creature whom 
                    they imitate and follow, ever changing, as he changes, and 
                    ever living and growing, at one time in one manner, and at 
                    another time in another. Enough of the story, which may be 
                    of use in showing us how greatly we erred in the delineation 
                    of the king and the statesman in our previous discourse.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What was this great error of which you speak?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There were two; the first a lesser one, the other was 
                    an<br>
                    error on a much larger and grander scale.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I mean to say that when we were asked about a king and<br>
                    statesman of the present; and generation, we told of a shepherd 
                    of a<br>
                    human flock who belonged to the other cycle, and of one who 
                    was a<br>
                    god when he ought to have been a man; and this a great error. 
                    Again,<br>
                    we declared him to be, the ruler of the entire State, without,<br>
                    explaining how: this was not the whole truth, nor very intelligible;<br>
                    but still it was true, and therefore the second error was 
                    not so,<br>
                    great as the first.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y Soc. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Before we can expect to have a perfect description of 
                    the<br>
                    statesman we must define the nature of his office.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the myth was introduced in order to show, not <br>
                    only that all others are rivals of true shepherd who is the 
                    object of our search, but in order that we might have a clearer 
                    view of him who is alone worthy to receive this appellation, 
                    because, he alone of <br>
                    shepherds and herdsmen, according to the image which we have 
                    employed, has the care of human beings.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And I cannot help thinking, Socrates, that the form 
                    of the<br>
                    divine shepherd is even higher than that of a king; whereas 
                    the<br>
                    statesmen who are now on earth seem to be much more like their<br>
                    subjects in character, and which more nearly to partake of 
                    their<br>
                    breeding and education.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Still they must be investigated all the same, to see 
                    whether,<br>
                    like the divine shepherd, they are above their subjects or 
                    on a<br>
                    level with them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Of course.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. To resume:-Do you remember that we spoke of a<br>
                    command-for-self exercised over animals, not singly but<br>
                    collectively, which we called the art of rearing a herd?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes, I remember.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There, somewhere, lay our error; for we never included 
                    or<br>
                    mentioned the Statesman; and we did not observe that he had 
                    no place in our nomenclature.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How was that?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. All other herdsmen &quot;rear&quot; their herds, but 
                    this is not a<br>
                    suitable term to apply to the Statesman; we should use a <br>
                    name which is common to them all.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True, if there be such a name.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Why, is not &quot;care&quot; of herds applicable to 
                    all? For <br>
                    this implies no feeding, or any special duty; if we say either 
                    &quot;tending&quot; <br>
                    the herds, or &quot;managing&quot; the herds, or &quot;having 
                    the care&quot; of them, the same word will include all, and 
                    then we may wrap up the Statesman with the rest, as the argument 
                    seems to require.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Quite right; but how shall we take the-next step 
                    in the<br>
                    division?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. As before we divided the art of &quot;rearing&quot; 
                    herds accordingly<br>
                    as they were land or water herds, winged and wingless, mixing 
                    or not<br>
                    mixing the breed, horned and hornless, so we may divide by 
                    these<br>
                    same differences the &quot;teading&quot; of herds, comprehending 
                    in our<br>
                    definition the kingship of to-day and the rule of Cronos.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. That is clear; but I still ask, what is to follow.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. If the word had been &quot;managing&quot; herds, instead 
                    of feeding or<br>
                    rearing them, no one would have argued that there was no care 
                    of men in the case of the politician, although it was justly 
                    contended,<br>
                    that there was no human art of feeding them which was worthy 
                    of the<br>
                    name, or at least, if there were, many a man had a prior and 
                    greater<br>
                    right to share in such an art than any king.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But no other art or science will have a prior or better 
                    right<br>
                    than the royal science to care for human society and to rule 
                    over<br>
                    men in general.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. In the next place, Socrates, we must surely notice <br>
                    that a great error was committed at the end of our analysis.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What was it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Why, supposing we were ever so sure that there is such 
                    an art<br>
                    as the art of rearing or feeding bipeds, there was no reason 
                    why we<br>
                    should call this the royal or political art, as though there 
                    were no<br>
                    more to be said.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Our first duty, as we were saying, was to remodel the 
                    name,<br>
                    so as to have the notion of care rather than of feeding, and 
                    then to<br>
                    divide, for there may be still considerable divisions.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How can they be made?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. First, by separating the divine shepherd from the human<br>
                    guardian or manager.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the art of management which is assigned to man would<br>
                    again have to be subdivided.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. On what principle?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. On the principle of voluntary and compulsory.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Why?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Because, if I am not mistaken, there has been an error 
                    here;<br>
                    for our simplicity led us to rank king and tyrant together, 
                    whereas<br>
                    they are utterly distinct, like their modes of government.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then, now, as I said, let us make the correction and 
                    divide<br>
                    human care into two parts, on the principle of voluntary and<br>
                    compulsory.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And if we call the management of violent rulers tyranny, 
                    and<br>
                    the voluntary management of herds of voluntary bipeds <br>
                    politics, may we not further assert that he who has this latter 
                    art of management is the true king and statesman?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I think, Stranger, that we have now completed the 
                    <br>
                    account of the Statesman.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Would that we had Socrates, but I have to satisfy myself 
                    as<br>
                    well as you; and in my judgment the figure of the king is 
                    not yet<br>
                    perfected; like statuaries who, in their too great haste, 
                    having<br>
                    overdone the several parts of their work, lose time in cutting 
                    them<br>
                    down, so too we, partly out of haste, partly out of haste, 
                    partly<br>
                    out of a magnanimous desire to expose our former error, and 
                    also<br>
                    because we imagined that a king required grand illustrations, 
                    have<br>
                    taken up a marvellous lump of fable, and have been obliged 
                    <br>
                    to use more than was necessary. This made us discourse at 
                    large, and, nevertheless, the story never came to an end. 
                    And our <br>
                    discussion might be compared to a picture of some living being 
                    which had been fairly drawn in outline, but had not yet attained 
                    the life and clearness which is given by the blending of colours. 
                    Now to intelligent persons a living being had better be delineated 
                    by language and discourse than by any painting or work of 
                    art: to the duller sort by works of art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true; but what is the imperfection which <br>
                    still remains? I wish that you would tell me.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The higher ideas, my dear friend, can hardly be set 
                    forth<br>
                    except through the medium of examples; every man seems to 
                    know all things in a dreamy sort of way, and then again to 
                    wake up and to<br>
                    know nothing.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I fear that I have been unfortunate in raising a question 
                    about<br>
                    our experience of knowledge.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Why so?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Why, because my &quot;example&quot; requires the assistance 
                    of another<br>
                    example.<br>
                  </p>

                    correctly about the letters in question, and then to compare 
                    these<br>
                    with the cases in which they do not as yet know, and to show 
                    <br>

                    compare it with another distinct instance of the same thing, 
                    of<br>

                    about the alphabet of things, and sometimes and in some cases 
                    is<br>
                    firmly fixed by the truth in each particular, and then, again, 
                    in<br>
                    other cases is altogether at sea; having somehow or other 
                    a <br>
                    correction of combinations; but when the elements are transferred

                    and as<br>
                    there were innumerable rivals of the royal race who claim 
                    to have<br>
                    the care of states, let us part them all off, and leave him 
                    alone;<br>
                    and, as I was saying, a model or example of this process has 
                    first<br>
                    to be framed.<br>

                    analogy<br>
                    with the political occupation? Suppose, Socrates, that if 
                    we have no<br>
                    other example at hand, we choose weaving, or, more precisely,<br>
                    weaving of wool-this will be quite enough, without taking 
                    <br>
                    the whole of weaving, to illustrate our meaning?<br>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Why should we not apply to weaving the same processes 
                    of<br>
                    division and subdivision which we have already applied to 
                    other<br>
                    classes; going once more as rapidly as we can through all 
                    the steps<br>
                    until we come to that which is needed for our purpose?<br>

                    or<br>
                    preventive; of the preventive class are antidotes, divine 
                    and human,<br>
                    and also defences; and defences are either military weapons 
                    or<br>
                    protections; and protections are veils, and also shields against<br>
                    heat and cold, and shields against heat and cold are shelters 
                    and<br>
                    coverings; and coverings are blankets and garments; and garments 
                    are<br>
                    some of them in one piece, and others of them are made in 
                    several<br>
                    parts; and of these latter some are stitched, others are fastened<br>
                    and not stitched; and of the not stitched, some are made of 
                    <br>
                    the sinews of plants, and some of hair; and of these, again, 
                    some are cemented with water and earth, and others are fastened 
                    together by<br>
                    themselves. And these last defences and coverings which are 
                    fastened<br>
                    together by themselves are called clothes, and the art which<br>
                    superintends them we may call, from the nature of the operation, 
                    the<br>
                    art of clothing, just as before the art of the Statesman was 
                    derived<br>
                    from the State; and may we not say that the art of weaving, 
                    at least<br>
                    that largest portion of it which was concerned with the making 
                    of<br>
                    clothes, differs only in name from this art of clothing, in 
                    the same<br>
                    way that, in the previous case, the royal science differed 
                    from the<br>
                    political?<br>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Str. In the next place, let us make the reflection, that 
                    the art<br>
                    of weaving clothes, which an incompetent person might fancy 
                    to have<br>
                    been sufficiently described, has been separated off from several<br>
                    others which are of the same family, but not from the co-operative<br>
                    arts.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. And which are the kindred arts?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I see that I have not taken you with me. So I think 
                    <br>
                    that we had better go backwards, starting from the end. We 
                    just now parted off from the weaving of clothes, the making 
                    of blankets, which <br>
                    differ from each other in that one is put under and the other 
                    is put around! and these are what I termed kindred arts.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. I understand.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And we have subtracted the manufacture of all articles 
                    made<br>
                    of flax and cords, and all that we just now metaphorically 
                    termed<br>
                    the sinews of plants, and we have also separated off the process 
                    of<br>
                    felting and the putting together of materials by stitching 
                    <br>
                    and sewing, of which the most important part is the cobbler's 
                    art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Precisely.</p>
                  <p> Str. Then we separated off the currier's art, which prepared<br>
                    coverings in entire pieces, and the art of sheltering, and<br>
                    subtracted the various arts of making water-tight which are 
                    employed<br>
                    in building, and in general in carpentering, and in other 
                    crafts,<br>
                    and all such arts as furnish impediments to thieving and acts 
                    of<br>
                    violence, and are concerned with making the lids of boxes 
                    and the<br>
                    fixing of doors, being divisions of the art of joining; and 
                    we also<br>
                    cut off the manufacture of arms, which is a section of the 
                    great and<br>
                    manifold art of making defences; and we originally began by 
                    parting<br>
                    off the whole of the magic art which is concerned with antidoter,<br>
                    and have left, as would appear, the very art of which we were 
                    in<br>
                    search, the art of protection against winter cold, which fabricates<br>
                    woollen defences, and has the name of weaving.<br>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes, my boy, but that is not all; for the first process 
                    to<br>
                    which the material is subjected is the opposite of weaving.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. How so?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Weaving is a sort of uniting?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Yes.<br>
                  </p>

                    <br>

                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I mean the work of the carder's art; for we cannot say 
                    that<br>
                    carding is weaving, or that the carder is a weaver.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Again, if a person were to say that the art of making 
                    the<br>
                    warp and the woof was the art of weaving, he would say what 
                    was<br>
                    paradoxical and false.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. To be sure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Shall we say that the whole art of the fuller or of 
                    the<br>
                    mender has nothing to do with the care and treatment clotes, 
                    <br>
                    or are we to regard all these as arts of weaving?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Certainly not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And yet surely all these arts will maintain that they 
                    are<br>
                    concerned with the treatment and production of clothes; they 
                    will<br>
                    dispute the exclusive prerogative of weaving, and though assigning 
                    a<br>
                    larger sphere to that, will still reserve a considerable field 
                    for<br>
                    themselves.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Besides these, there are the arts which make tools and<br>
                    instruments of weaving, and which will claim at least to be<br>
                    cooperative causes in every work of the weaver.<br>
                  </p>

                    <br>
                    that part of it which has been selected by us, to be the greatest 
                    and <br>
                    noblest of arts which are concerned with woollen garments-shall 
                    we be right? Is not the definition, although true, wanting 
                    in clearness and<br>
                    completeness; for do not all those other arts require to be 
                    first<br>
                    cleared away?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then the next thing will be to separate them, in <br>
                    order that the argument may proceed in a regular manner?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. By all means.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us consider, in the first place, that there are 
                    two kinds<br>
                    of arts entering into everything which we do.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What are they?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The one kind is the conditional or cooperative, the 
                    other the<br>
                    principal cause.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The arts which do not manufacture the actual thing, 
                    but which<br>
                    furnish the necessary tools for the manufacture, without which 
                    the<br>
                    several arts could not fulfil their appointed work, are<br>
                    co-operative; but those which make the things themselves are 
                    causal.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. A very reasonable distinction.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Thus the arts which make spindles, combs, and other 
                    <br>
                    instruments of the production of clothes may be called co-operative, 
                    and those which treat and fabricate the things themselves, 
                    causal.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The arts of washing and mending, and the other <br>
                    preparatory arts which belong to the causal class, and form 
                    a division of the great art of adornment, may be all comprehended 
                    under what we call the fuller's art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Y. Soc. Very good.</p>

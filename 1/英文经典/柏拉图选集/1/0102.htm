                    Athenian Stranger. And now we have to consider whether the 
                    insightinto human nature is the only benefit derived from 
                    well orderedpotations, or whether there are not other advantages 
                    great and much tobe desired. The argument seems to imply that 
                    there are. But how and inwhat way these are to be attained, 
                    will have to be consideredattentively, or we may be entangled 
                    in error.</p>
                  <p>Cleinias. Proceed.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let me once more recall our doctrine of right education; 
                    which,if I am not mistaken, depends on the due regulation 
                    of convivialintercourse.</p>
                  <p>Cle. You talk rather grandly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Pleasure and pain I maintain to be the first perceptions 
                    ofchildren, and I say that they are the forms under which 
                    virtue andvice are originally present to them. As to wisdom 
                    and true and fixedopinions, happy is the man who acquires 
                    them, even when declining inyears; and we may say that he 
                    who possesses them, and the blessingswhich are contained in 
                    them, is a perfect man. Now I mean by educationthat training 
                    which is given by suitable habits to the first instinctsof 
                    virtue in children;-when pleasure, and friendship, and pain, 
                    andhatred, are rightly implanted in souls not yet capable 
                    ofunderstanding the nature of them, and who find them, after 
                    they haveattained reason, to be in harmony with her. This 
                    harmony of thesoul, taken as a whole, is virtue; but the particular 
                    training inrespect of pleasure and pain, which leads you always 
                    to hate whatyou ought to hate, and love what you ought to 
                    love from thebeginning of life to the end, may be separated 
                    off; and, in my view,will be rightly called education.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I think, Stranger, that you are quite right in all that 
                    youhave said and are saying about education.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I am glad to hear that you agree with me; for, indeed, 
                    thediscipline of pleasure and pain which, when rightly ordered, 
                    is aprinciple of education, has been often relaxed and corrupted 
                    inhuman life. And the Gods, pitying the toils which our race 
                    is bornto undergo, have appointed holy festivals, wherein 
                    men alternaterest with labour; and have given them the Muses 
                    and Apollo, the leaderof the Muses, and Dionysus, to be companions 
                    in their revels, thatthey may improve their education by taking 
                    part in the festivals ofthe Gods, and with their help. I should 
                    like to know whether acommon saying is in our opinion true 
                    to nature or not. For men saythat the young of all creatures 
                    cannot be quiet in their bodies orin their voices; they are 
                    always wanting to move and cry out; someleaping and skipping, 
                    and overflowing with sportiveness and delight atsomething, 
                    others uttering all sorts of cries. But, whereas theanimals 
                    have no perception of order or disorder in their movements,that 
                    is, of rhythm or harmony, as they are called, to us, the Gods,who, 
                    as we say, have been appointed to be our companions in the 
                    dance,have given the pleasurable sense of harmony and rhythm; 
                    and so theystir us into life, and we follow them, joining 
                    hands together indances and songs; and these they call choruses, 
                    which is a termnaturally expressive of cheerfulness. Shall 
                    we begin, then, with theacknowledgment that education is first 
                    given through Apollo and theMuses? What do you say?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I assent.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And the uneducated is he who has not been trained in 
                    thechorus, and the educated is he who has been well trained?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And the chorus is made up of two parts, dance and song?</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then he who is well educated will be able to sing and 
                    dancewell?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I suppose that he will.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us see; what are we saying?</p>
                  <p>Cle. What?</p>
                  <p>Ath. He sings well and dances well; now must we add that 
                    he singswhat is good and dances what is good?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Let us make the addition.</p>
                  <p>Ath. We will suppose that he knows the good to be good, and 
                    thebad to be bad, and makes use of them accordingly: which 
                    now is thebetter trained in dancing and music-he who is able 
                    to move his bodyand to use his voice in what is understood 
                    to be the right manner, buthas no delight in good or hatred 
                    of evil; or he who is incorrect ingesture and voice, but is 
                    right in his sense of pleasure and pain, andwelcomes what 
                    is good, and is offended at what is evil?</p>
                  <p>Cle. There is a great difference, Stranger, in the two kinds 
                    ofeducation.</p>
                  <p>Ath. If we three know what is good in song and dance, then 
                    wetruly know also who is educated and who is uneducated; but 
                    if not,then we certainly shall not know wherein lies the safeguard 
                    ofeducation, and whether there is any or not.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us follow the scent like hounds, and go in pursuit 
                    ofbeauty of figure, and melody, and song, and dance; if these 
                    escape us,there will be no use in talking about true education, 
                    whether Hellenicor barbarian.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And what is beauty of figure, or beautiful melody? When 
                    a manlysoul is in trouble, and when a cowardly soul is in 
                    similar case, arethey likely to use the same figures and gestures, 
                    or to give utteranceto the same sounds?</p>
                  <p>Cle. How can they, when the very colours of their faces differ?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Good, my friend; I may observe, however, in passing, 
                    that inmusic there certainly are figures and there are melodies: 
                    and music isconcerned with harmony and rhythm, so that you 
                    may speak of a melodyor figure having good rhythm or good 
                    harmony-the term is correctenough; but to speak metaphorically 
                    of a melody or figure having a&quot;good colour,&quot; as 
                    the masters of choruses do, is not allowable,although you 
                    can speak of the melodies or figures of the brave and thecoward, 
                    praising the one and censuring the other. And not to betedious, 
                    let us say that the figures and melodies which are expressiveof 
                    virtue of soul or body, or of images of virtue, are withoutexception 
                    good, and those which are expressive of vice are the reverseof 
                    good.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Your suggestion is excellent; and let us answer that 
                    thesethings are so.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Once more, are all of us equally delighted with every 
                    sort ofdance?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Far otherwise.</p>
                  <p>Ath. What, then, leads us astray? Are beautiful things not 
                    thesame to us all, or are they the same in themselves, but 
                    not in ouropinion of them? For no one will admit that forms 
                    of vice in the danceare more beautiful than forms of virtue, 
                    or that he himself delightsin the forms of vice, and others 
                    in a muse of another character. Andyet most persons say, that 
                    the excellence of music is to give pleasureto our souls. But 
                    this is intolerable and blasphemous; there is,however, a much 
                    more plausible account of the delusion.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The adaptation of art to the characters of men. Choricmovements 
                    are imitations of manners occurring in various actions,fortunes, 
                    dispositions-each particular is imitated, and those towhom 
                    the words, or songs, or dances are suited, either by nature 
                    orhabit or both, cannot help feeling pleasure in them and 
                    applaudingthem, and calling them beautiful. But those whose 
                    natures, or ways, orhabits are unsuited to them, cannot delight 
                    in them or applaud them,and they call them base. There are 
                    others, again, whose natures areright and their habits wrong, 
                    or whose habits are right and theirnatures wrong, and they 
                    praise one thing, but are pleased atanother. For they say 
                    that all these imitations are pleasant, butnot good. And in 
                    the presence of those whom they think wise, theyare ashamed 
                    of dancing and singing in the baser manner, or ofdeliberately 
                    lending any countenance to such proceedings; and yet,they 
                    have a secret pleasure in them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And is any harm done to the lover of vicious dances 
                    or songs,or any good done to the approver of the opposite 
                    sort of pleasure?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I think that there is.</p>
                  <p>Ath. &quot;I think&quot; is not the word, but I would say, 
                    rather, &quot;I amcertain.&quot; For must they not have the 
                    same effect as when a manassociates with bad characters, whom 
                    he likes and approves rather thandislikes, and only censures 
                    playfully because he has a suspicion ofhis own badness? In 
                    that case, he who takes pleasure in them willsurely become 
                    like those in whom he takes pleasure, even though hebe ashamed 
                    to praise them. And what greater good or evil can anydestiny 
                    ever make us undergo?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I know of none.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then in a city which has good laws, or in future ages 
                    is tohave them, bearing in mind the instruction and amusement 
                    which aregiven by music, can we suppose that the poets are 
                    to be allowed toteach in the dance anything which they themselves 
                    like, in the wayof rhythm, or melody, or words, to the young 
                    children of anywell-conditioned parents? Is the poet to train 
                    his choruses as hepleases, without reference to virtue or 
                    vice?</p>
                  <p>Cle. That is surely quite unreasonable, and is not to be 
                    thought of.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And yet he may do this in almost any state with the 
                    exceptionof Egypt.</p>
                  <p>Cle. And what are the laws about music and dancing in Egypt?</p>
                  <p>Ath. You will wonder when I tell you: Long ago they appear 
                    to haverecognized the very principle of which we are now speaking-thattheir 
                    young citizens must be habituated to forms and strains ofvirtue. 
                    These they fixed, and exhibited the patterns of them intheir 
                    temples; and no painter or artist is allowed to innovate uponthem, 
                    or to leave the traditional forms and invent new ones. To 
                    thisday, no alteration is allowed either in these arts, or 
                    in music atall. And you will find that their works of art 
                    are painted ormoulded in the same forms which they had ten 
                    thousand yearsago;-this is literally true and no exaggeration-their 
                    ancientpaintings and sculptures are not a whit better or worse 
                    than thework of to-day, but are made with just the same skill.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How extraordinary!</p>
                  <p>Ath. I should rather say, How statesmanlike, how worthy of 
                    alegislator! I know that other things in Egypt are nat so 
                    well. Butwhat I am telling you about music is true and deserving 
                    ofconsideration, because showing that a lawgiver may institutemelodies 
                    which have a natural truth and correctness without any fearof 
                    failure. To do this, however, must be the work of God, or 
                    of adivine person; in Egypt they have a tradition that their 
                    ancientchants which have been preserved for so many ages are 
                    thecomposition of the Goddess Isis. And therefore, as I was 
                    saying, ifa person can only find in any way the natural melodies, 
                    he mayconfidently embody them in a fixed and legal form. For 
                    the love ofnovelty which arises out of pleasure in the new 
                    and weariness of theold, has not strength enough to corrupt 
                    the consecrated song anddance, under the plea that they have 
                    become antiquated. At any rate,they are far from being corrupted 
                    in Egypt.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Your arguments seem to prove your point.</p>
                  <p>Ath. May we not confidently say that the true use of music 
                    and ofchoral festivities is as follows: We rejoice when we 
                    think that weprosper, and again we think that we prosper when 
                    we rejoice?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Exactly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And when rejoicing in our good fortune, we are unable 
                    to bestill?</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Our young men break forth into dancing and singing, 
                    and wewho are their elders deem that we are fulfilling our 
                    part in life whenwe look on at them. Having lost our agility, 
                    we delight in theirsports and merry-making, because we love 
                    to think of our formerselves; and gladly institute contests 
                    for those who are able to awakenin us the memory of our youth.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Is it altogether unmeaning to say, as the common people 
                    doabout festivals, that he should be adjudged the wisest of 
                    men, and thewinner of the palm, who gives us the greatest 
                    amount of pleasure andmirth? For on such occasions, and when 
                    mirth is the order of theday, ought not he to be honoured 
                    most, and, as I was saying, bearthe palm, who gives most mirth 
                    to the greatest number? Now is this atrue way of speaking 
                    or of acting?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Possibly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But, my dear friend, let us distinguish between differentcases, 
                    and not be hasty in forming a judgment: One way ofconsidering 
                    the question will be to imagine a festival at whichthere are 
                    entertainments of all sorts, including gymnastic, musical,and 
                    equestrian contests: the citizens are assembled; prizes areoffered, 
                    and proclamation is made that any one who likes may enter 
                    thelists, and that he is to bear the palm who gives the most 
                    pleasureto the spectators-there is to be no regulation about 
                    the manner how;but he who is most successful in giving pleasure 
                    is to be crownedvictor, and deemed to be the pleasantest of 
                    the candidates: What islikely to be the result of such a proclamation?</p>
                  <p>Cle. In what respect?</p>
                  <p>Ath. There would be various exhibitions: one man, like Homer, 
                    willexhibit a rhapsody, another a performance on the lute; 
                    one will have atragedy, and another a comedy. Nor would there 
                    be anything astonishingin some one imagining that he could 
                    gain the prize by exhibiting apuppet-show. Suppose these competitors 
                    to meet, and not these only,but innumerable others as well 
                    can you tell me who ought to be thevictor?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I do not see how any one can answer you, or pretend 
                    to know,unless he has heard with his own ears the several 
                    competitors; thequestion is absurd.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, then, if neither of you can answer, shall I answer 
                    thisquestion which you deem so absurd?</p>
                  <p>Cle. By all means.</p>
                  <p>Ath. If very small children are to determine the question, 
                    they willdecide for the puppet show.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Of course.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The older children will be advocates of comedy; educated 
                    women,and young men, and people in general, will favour tragedy.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very likely.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And I believe that we old men would have the greatestpleasure 
                    in hearing a rhapsodist recite well the Iliad and Odyssey, 
                    orone of the Hesiodic poems, and would award the victory to 
                    him. But,who would really be the victor?-that is the question.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Clearly you and I will have to declare that those whom 
                    we oldmen adjudge victors ought to win; for our ways are far 
                    and away betterthan any which at present exist anywhere in 
                    the world.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Thus far I too should agree with the many, that theexcellence 
                    of music is to be measured by pleasure. But the pleasuremust 
                    not be that of chance persons; the fairest music is that whichdelights 
                    the best and best educated, and especially that whichdelights 
                    the one man who is pre-eminent in virtue and education. Andtherefore 
                    the judges must be men of character, for they will requireboth 
                    wisdom and courage; the true judge must not draw hisinspiration 
                    from the theatre, nor ought he to be unnerved by theclamour 
                    of the many and his own incapacity; nor again, knowing thetruth, 
                    ought he through cowardice and unmanliness carelessly todeliver 
                    a lying judgment, with the very same lips which have justappealed 
                    to the Gods before he judged. He is sitting not as thedisciple 
                    of the theatre, but, in his proper place, as theirinstructor, 
                    and he ought to be the enemy of all pandering to thepleasure 
                    of the spectators. The ancient and common custom of Hellas,which 
                    still prevails in Italy and Sicily, did certainly leave thejudgment 
                    to the body of spectators, who determined the victor byshow 
                    of hands. But this custom has been the destruction of thepoets; 
                    for they are now in the habit of composing with a view toplease 
                    the bad taste of their judges, and the result is that thespectators 
                    instruct themselves;-and also it has been the ruin of thetheatre; 
                    they ought to be having characters put before them betterthan 
                    their own, and so receiving a higher pleasure, but now by 
                    theirown act the opposite result follows. What inference is 
                    to be drawnfrom all this? Shall I tell you?</p>
                  <p>Cle. What?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The inference at which we arrive for the third or fourth 
                    timeis, that education is the constraining and directing of 
                    youthtowards that right reason, which the law affirms, and 
                    which theexperience of the eldest and best has agreed to be 
                    truly right. Inorder, then, that the soul of the child may 
                    not be habituated tofeel joy and sorrow in a manner at variance 
                    with the law, and thosewho obey the law, but may rather follow 
                    the law and rejoice and sorrowat the same things as the aged-in 
                    order, I say, to produce thiseffect, chants appear to have 
                    been invented, which really enchant, andare designed to implant 
                    that harmony of which we speak. And, becausethe mind of the 
                    child is incapable of enduring serious training,they are called 
                    plays and songs, and are performed in play; just aswhen men 
                    are sick and ailing in their bodies, their attendants givethem 
                    wholesome diet in pleasant meats and drinks, but unwholesome 
                    dietin disagreeable things, in order that they may learn, 
                    as they ought,to like the one, and to dislike the other. And 
                    similarly the truelegislator will persuade, and, if he cannot 
                    persuade, will compelthe poet to express, as he ought, by 
                    fair and noble words, in hisrhythms, the figures, and in his 
                    melodies, the music of temperateand brave and in every way 
                    good men.</p>
                  <p>Cle. But do you really imagine, Stranger, that this is the 
                    way inwhich poets generally compose in States at the present 
                    day? As faras I can observe, except among us and among the 
                    Lacedaemonians,there are no regulations like those of which 
                    you speak; in otherplaces novelties are always being introduced 
                    in dancing and inmusic, generally not under the authority 
                    of any law, but at theinstigation of lawless pleasures; and 
                    these pleasures are so farfrom being the same, as you describe 
                    the Egyptian to be, or having thesame principles, that they 
                    are never the same.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Most true, Cleinias; and I daresay that I may have expressedmyself 
                    obscurely, and so led you to imagine that I was speaking ofsome 
                    really existing state of things, whereas I was only saying 
                    whatregulations I would like to have about music; and hence 
                    there occurreda misapprehension on your part. For when evils 
                    are far gone andirremediable, the task of censuring them is 
                    never pleasant, althoughat times necessary. But as we do not 
                    really differ, will you let meask you whether you consider 
                    such institutions to be more prevalentamong the Cretans and 
                    Lacedaemonians than among the other Hellenes?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly they are.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And if they were extended to the other Hellenes, would 
                    it be animprovement on the present state of things?</p>
                  <p>Cle. A very great improvement, if the customs which prevail 
                    amongthem were such as prevail among us and the Lacedaemonians, 
                    and such asyou were just now saying ought to prevail.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us see whether we understand one another:-Are not 
                    theprinciples of education and music which prevail among you 
                    asfollows: you compel your poets to say that the good man, 
                    if he betemperate and just, is fortunate and happy; and this 
                    whether he begreat and strong or small and weak, and whether 
                    he be rich or poor;and, on the other hand, if he have a wealth 
                    passing that of Cinyras orMidas, and be unjust, he is wretched 
                    and lives in misery? As thepoet says, and with truth: I sing 
                    not, I care not about him whoaccomplishes all noble things, 
                    not having justice; let him who&quot;draws near and stretches 
                    out his hand against his enemies be a justman.&quot; But if 
                    he be unjust, I would not have him &quot;look calmly uponbloody 
                    death,&quot; nor &quot;surpass in swiftness the Thracian Boreas&quot;; 
                    and letno other thing that is called good ever be his. For 
                    the goods of whichthe many speak are not really good: first 
                    in the catalogue is placedhealth, beauty next, wealth third; 
                    and then innumerable others, as forexample to have a keen 
                    eye or a quick ear, and in general to haveall the senses perfect; 
                    or, again, to be a tyrant and do as youlike; and the final 
                    consummation of happiness is to have acquiredall these things, 
                    and when you have acquired them to become at onceimmortal. 
                    But you and I say, that while to the just and holy all thesethings 
                    are the best of possessions, to the unjust they are all,including 
                    even health, the greatest of evils. For in truth, to havesight, 
                    and hearing, and the use of the senses, or to live at allwithout 
                    justice and virtue, even though a man be rich in all theso-called 
                    goods of fortune, is the greatest of evils, if life beimmortal; 
                    but not so great, if the bad man lives only a very shorttime. 
                    These are the truths which, if I am not mistaken, you willpersuade 
                    or compel your poets to utter with suitable accompaniments 
                    ofharmony and rhythm, and in these they must train up your 
                    youth. Am Inot right? For I plainly declare that evils as 
                    they are termed aregoods to the unjust, and only evils to 
                    the just, and that goods aretruly good to the good, but evil 
                    to the evil. Let me ask again, Areyou and I agreed about this?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I think that we partly agree and partly do not.</p>
                  <p>Ath. When a man has health and wealth and a tyranny which 
                    lasts, andwhen he is preeminent in strength and courage, and 
                    has the gift ofimmortality, and none of the so-called evils 
                    which counter-balancethese goods, but only the injustice and 
                    insolence of his own nature-ofsuch an one you are, I suspect, 
                    unwilling to believe that he ismiserable rather than happy.</p>
                  <p>Cle. That is quite true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Once more: Suppose that he be valiant and strong, andhandsome 
                    and rich, and does throughout his whole life whatever helikes, 
                    still, if he be unrighteous and insolent, would not both of 
                    youagree that he will of necessity live basely? You will surely 
                    grantso much?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And an evil life too?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I am not equally disposed to grant that.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Will he not live painfully and to his own disadvantage?</p>
                  <p>Cle. How can I possibly say so?</p>
                  <p>Ath. How! Then may Heaven make us to be of one mind, for 
                    now weare of two. To me, dear Cleinias, the truth of what 
                    I am saying isas plain as the fact that Crete is an island. 
                    And, if I were alawgiver, I would try to make the poets and 
                    all the citizens speakin this strain, and I would inflict 
                    the heaviest penalties on anyone in all the land who should 
                    dare to say that there are bad menwho lead pleasant lives, 
                    or that the profitable and gainful is onething, and the just 
                    another; and there are many other matters aboutwhich I should 
                    make my citizens speak in a manner different from theCretans 
                    and Lacedaemonians of this age, and I may say, indeed, fromthe 
                    world in general. For tell me, my good friends, by Zeus and 
                    Apollotell me, if I were to ask these same Gods who were your 
                    legislators-Isnot the most just life also the pleasantest? 
                    or are there two lives,one of which is the justest and the 
                    other the pleasantest?-and theywere to reply that there are 
                    two; and thereupon I proceeded to ask,(that would be the right 
                    way of pursuing the enquiry), Which are thehappier-those who 
                    lead the justest, or those who lead thepleasantest life? and 
                    they replied, Those who lead thepleasantest-that would be 
                    a very strange answer, which I should notlike to put into 
                    the mouth of the Gods. The words will come withmore propriety 
                    from the lips of fathers and legislators, and thereforeI will 
                    repeat my former questions to one of them, and suppose him 
                    tosay again that he who leads the pleasantest life is the 
                    happiest.And to that I rejoin:-O my father, did you not wish 
                    me to live ashappily as possible? And yet you also never ceased 
                    telling me that Ishould live as justly as possible. Now, here 
                    the giver of the rule,whether he be legislator or father, 
                    will be in a dilemma, and willin vain endeavour to be consistent 
                    with himself. But if he were todeclare that the justest life 
                    is also the happiest, every onehearing him would enquire, 
                    if I am not mistaken, what is that good andnoble principle 
                    in life which the law approves, and which issuperior to pleasure. 
                    For what good can the just man have which isseparated from 
                    pleasure? Shall we say that glory and fame, coming fromGods 
                    and men, though good and noble, are nevertheless unpleasant,and 
                    infamy pleasant? Certainly not, sweet legislator. Or shall 
                    wesay that the not-doing of wrong and there being no wrong 
                    done isgood and honourable, although there is no pleasure 
                    in it, and that thedoing wrong is pleasant, but evil and base?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Impossible.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The view which identifies the pleasant and the pleasant 
                    and thejust and the good and the noble has an excellent moral 
                    and religioustendency. And the opposite view is most at variance 
                    with the designsof the legislator, and is, in his opinion, 
                    infamous; for no one, if hecan help, will be persuaded to 
                    do that which gives him more painthan pleasure. But as distant 
                    prospects are apt to make us dizzy,especially in childhood, 
                    the legislator will try to purge away thedarkness and exhibit 
                    the truth; he will persuade the citizens, in someway or other, 
                    by customs and praises and words, that just and unjustare 
                    shadows only, and that injustice, which seems opposed tojustice, 
                    when contemplated by the unjust and evil man appears pleasantand 
                    the just most unpleasant; but that from the just man's point 
                    ofview, the very opposite is the appearance of both of them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And which may be supposed to be the truer judgment-that 
                    ofthe inferior or of the better soul?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Surely, that of the better soul.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then the unjust life must not only be more base and 
                    depraved,but also more unpleasant than the just and holy life?</p>
                  <p>Cle. That seems to be implied in the present argument.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And even supposing this were otherwise, and not as the 
                    argumenthas proven, still the lawgiver, who is worth anything, 
                    if he everventures to tell a lie to the young for their good, 
                    could not invent amore useful lie than this, or one which 
                    will have a better effect inmaking them do what is right, 
                    not on compulsion but voluntarily.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Truth, Stranger, is a noble thing and a lasting, but 
                    a thing ofwhich men are hard to be persuaded.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And yet the story of the Sidonian Cadmus, which is soimprobable, 
                    has been readily believed, and also innumerable othertales.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is that story?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The story of armed men springing up after the sowing 
                    ofteeth, which the legislator may take as a proof that he 
                    can persuadethe minds of the young of anything; so that he 
                    has only to reflect andfind out what belief will be of the 
                    greatest public advantage, andthen use all his efforts to 
                    make the whole community utter one and thesame word in their 
                    songs and tales and discourses all their life long.But if 
                    you do not agree with me, there is no reason why you should 
                    notargue on the other side.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I do not see that any argument can fairly be raised 
                    by eitherof us against what you are now saying.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The next suggestion which I have to offer is, that all 
                    ourthree choruses shall sing to the young and tender souls 
                    of children,reciting in their strains all the noble thoughts 
                    of which we havealready spoken, or are about to speak; and 
                    the sum of them shall be,that the life which is by the Gods 
                    deemed to be the happiest is alsothe best;-we shall affirm 
                    this to be a most certain truth; and theminds of our young 
                    disciples will be more likely to receive thesewords of ours 
                    than any others which we might address to them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I assent to what you say.</p>
                  <p>Ath. First will enter in their natural order the sacred choircomposed 
                    of children, which is to sing lustily the heaven-taught layto 
                    the whole city. Next will follow the choir of young men under 
                    theage of thirty, who will call upon the God Paean to testify 
                    to thetruth of their words, and will pray him to be gracious 
                    to the youthand to turn their hearts. Thirdly, the choir of 
                    elder men, who arefrom thirty to sixty years of age, will 
                    also sing. There remainthose who are too old to sing, and 
                    they will tell stories,illustrating the same virtues, as with 
                    the voice of an oracle.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Who are those who compose the third choir, Stranger? 
                    for I donot clearly understand what you mean to say about 
                    them.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And yet almost all that I have been saying has said 
                    with a viewto them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Will you try to be a little plainer?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I was speaking at the commencement of our discourse, 
                    as youwill remember, of the fiery nature of young creatures: 
                    I said thatthey were unable to keep quiet either in limb or 
                    voice, and thatthey called out and jumped about in a disorderly 
                    manner; and that noother animal attained to any perception 
                    of order, but man only. Nowthe order of motion is called rhythm, 
                    and the order of the voice, inwhich high and low are duly 
                    mingled, is called harmony; and bothtogether are termed choric 
                    song. And I said that the Gods had pityon us, and gave us 
                    Apollo and the Muses to be our playfellows andleaders in the 
                    dance; and Dionysus, as I dare say that you willremember, 
                    was the third.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I quite remember.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Thus far I have spoken of the chorus of Apollo and the 
                    Muses,and I have still to speak of the remaining chorus, which 
                    is that ofDionysus.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How is that arranged? There is something strange, at 
                    any rateon first hearing, in a Dionysiac chorus of old men, 
                    if you really meanthat those who are above thirty, and may 
                    be fifty, or from fifty tosixty years of age, are to dance 
                    in his honour.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Very true; and therefore it must be shown that there 
                    is goodreason for the proposal.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Are we agreed thus far?</p>
                  <p>Cle. About what?</p>
                  <p>Ath. That every man and boy, slave and free, both sexes, 
                    and thewhole city, should never cease charming themselves 
                    with the strains ofwhich we have spoken; and that there should 
                    be every sort of changeand variation of them in order to take 
                    away the effect of sameness, sothat the singers may always 
                    receive pleasure from their hymns, and maynever weary of them?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Every one will agree.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Where, then, will that best part of our city which, 
                    by reasonof age and intelligence, has the greatest influence, 
                    sing thesefairest of strains, which are to do so much good? 
                    Shall we be sofoolish as to let them off who would give us 
                    the most beautiful andalso the most useful of songs?</p>
                  <p>Cle. But, says the argument, we cannot let them off.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then how can we carry out our purpose with decorum? 
                    Will thisbe the way?</p>
                  <p>Cle. What?</p>
                  <p>Ath. When a man is advancing in years, he is afraid and reluctant 
                    tosing;-he has no pleasure in his own performances; and if 
                    compulsion isused, he will be more and more ashamed, the older 
                    and more discreet hegrows;-is not this true?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, and will he not be yet more ashamed if he has 
                    to stand upand sing in the theatre to a mixed audience?-and 
                    if moreover when heis required to do so, like the other choirs 
                    who contend for prizes,and have been trained under a singing 
                    master, he is pinched andhungry, he will certainly have a 
                    feeling of shame and discomfort whichwill make him very unwilling 
                    to exhibit.</p>
                  <p>Cle. No doubt.</p>
                  <p>Ath. How, then, shall we reassure him, and get him to sing? 
                    Shall webegin by enacting that boys shall not taste wine at 
                    all until they areeighteen years of age; we will tell them 
                    that fire must not bepoured upon fire, whether in the body 
                    or in the soul, until they beginto go to work-this is a precaution 
                    which has to be taken against theexcitableness of youth;-afterwards 
                    they may taste wine in moderationup to the age of thirty, 
                    but while a man is young he should abstainaltogether from 
                    intoxication and from excess of wine; when, at length,he has 
                    reached forty years, after dinner at a public mess, he mayinvite 
                    not only the other Gods, but Dionysus above all, to the mysteryand 
                    festivity of the elder men, making use of the wine which he 
                    hasgiven men to lighten the sourness of old age; that in age 
                    we may renewour youth, and forget our sorrows; and also in 
                    order that the natureof the soul, like iron melted in the 
                    fire, may become softer and somore impressible. In the first 
                    place, will not any one who is thusmellowed be more ready 
                    and less ashamed to sing-I do not say beforea large audience, 
                    but before a moderate company; nor yet amongstrangers, but 
                    among his familiars, and, as we have often said, tochant, 
                    and to enchant?</p>
                  <p>Cle. He will be far more ready.</p>
                  <p>Ath. There will be no impropriety in our using such a method 
                    ofpersuading them to join with us in song.</p>
                  <p>Cle. None at all.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And what strain will they sing, and what muse will they 
                    hymn?The strain should clearly be one suitable to them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And what strain is suitable for heroes? Shall they sing 
                    achoric strain?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Truly, Stranger, we of Crete and Lacedaemon know no 
                    strainother than that which we have learnt and been accustomed 
                    to sing inour chorus.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I dare say; for you have never acquired the knowledge 
                    of themost beautiful kind of song, in your military way of 
                    life, which ismodelled after the camp, and is not like that 
                    of dwellers in cities;and you have your young men herding 
                    and feeding together like youngcolts. No one takes his own 
                    individual colt and drags him away fromhis fellows against 
                    his will, raging and foaming, and gives him agroom to attend 
                    to him alone, and trains and rubs him downprivately, and gives 
                    him the qualities in education which will makehim not only 
                    a good soldier, but also a governor of a state and ofcities. 
                    Such an one, as we said at first, would be a greater warriorthan 
                    he of whom Tyrtaeus sings; and he would honour courageeverywhere, 
                    but always as the fourth, and not as the first part ofvirtue, 
                    either in individuals or states.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Once more, Stranger, I must complain that you depreciate 
                    ourlawgivers.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Not intentionally, if at all, my good friend; but whither 
                    theargument leads, thither let us follow; for if there be 
                    indeed somestrain of song more beautiful than that of the 
                    choruses or thepublic theatres, I should like to impart it 
                    to those who, as we say,are ashamed of these, and want to 
                    have the best.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. When things have an accompanying charm, either the best 
                    thingin them is this very charm, or there is some rightness 
                    or utilitypossessed by them;-for example, I should say that 
                    eating and drinking,and the use of food in general, have an 
                    accompanying charm which wecall pleasure; but that this rightness 
                    and utility is just thehealthfulness of the things served 
                    up to us, which is their truerightness.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Just so.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Thus, too, I should say that learning has a certainaccompanying 
                    charm which is the pleasure; but that the right and theprofitable, 
                    the good and the noble, are qualities which the truthgives 
                    to it.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Exactly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And so in the imitative arts-if they succeed in makinglikenesses, 
                    and are accompanied by pleasure, may not their works besaid 
                    to have a charm?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But equal proportions, whether of quality or quantity, 
                    andnot pleasure, speaking generally, would give them truth 
                    or rightness.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then that only can be rightly judged by the standard 
                    ofpleasure, which makes or furnishes no utility or truth or 
                    likeness,nor on the other hand is productive of any hurtful 
                    quality, but existssolely for the sake of the accompanying 
                    charm; and the term &quot;pleasure&quot;is most appropriately 
                    applied to it when these other qualities areabsent.</p>
                  <p>Cle. You are speaking of harmless pleasure, are you not?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes; and this I term amusement, when doing neither harm 
                    norgood in any degree worth speaking of.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then, if such be our principles, we must assert thatimitation 
                    is not to be judged of by pleasure and false opinion; andthis 
                    is true of all equality, for the equal is not equal or thesymmetrical 
                    symmetrical, because somebody thinks or likes something,but 
                    they are to be judged of by the standard of truth, and by 
                    no otherwhatever.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Quite true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Do we not regard all music as representative and imitative?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then, when any one says that music is to be judged of 
                    bypleasure, his doctrine cannot be admitted; and if there 
                    be any musicof which pleasure is the criterion, such music 
                    is not to be sought outor deemed to have any real excellence, 
                    but only that other kind ofmusic which is an imitation of 
                    the good.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And those who seek for the best kind of song and music 
                    oughtnot to seek for that which is pleasant, but for that 
                    which is true;and the truth of imitation consists, as we were 
                    saying, in renderingthe thing imitated according to quantity 
                    and quality.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And every one will admit that musical compositions are 
                    allimitative and representative. Will not poets and spectators 
                    and actorsall agree in this?</p>
                  <p>Cle. They will.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Surely then he who would judge correctly must know what 
                    eachcomposition is; for if he does not know what is the character 
                    andmeaning of the piece, and what it represents, he will never 
                    discernwhether the intention is true or false.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly not.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And will he who does not know what is true be able todistinguish 
                    what is good and bad? My statement is not very clear;but perhaps 
                    you will understand me better if I put the matter inanother 
                    way.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How?</p>
                  <p>Ath. There are ten thousand likenesses of objects of sight?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And can he who does not know what the exact object is 
                    whichis imitated, ever know whether the resemblance is truthfully 
                    executed?I mean, for example, whether a statue has the proportions 
                    of a body,and the true situation of the parts; what those 
                    proportions are, andhow the parts fit into one another in 
                    due order; also their coloursand conformations, or whether 
                    this is all confused in the execution:do you think that any 
                    one can know about this, who does not knowwhat the animal 
                    is which has been imitated?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Impossible.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But even if we know that the thing pictured or sculptured 
                    isa man, who has received at the hand of the artist all his 
                    proper partsand colours and shapes, must we not also know 
                    whether the work isbeautiful or in any respect deficient in 
                    beauty?</p>
                  <p>Cle. If this were not required, Stranger, we should all of 
                    us bejudges of beauty.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Very true; and may we not say that in everything imitated,whether 
                    in drawing, music, or any other art, he who is to be acompetent 
                    judge must possess three things;-he must know, in thefirst 
                    place, of what the imitation is; secondly, he must know thatit 
                    is true; and thirdly, that it has been well executed in words 
                    andmelodies and rhythms?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then let us not faint in discussing the peculiar difficultyof 
                    music. Music is more celebrated than any other kind of imitation,and 
                    therefore requires the greatest care of them all. For if a 
                    manmakes a mistake here, he may do himself the greatest injury 
                    bywelcoming evil dispositions, and the mistake may be very 
                    difficultto discern, because the poets are artists very inferior 
                    in characterto the Muses themselves, who would never fall 
                    into the monstrous errorof assigning to the words of men the 
                    gestures and songs of women;nor after combining the melodies 
                    with the gestures of freemen wouldthey add on the rhythms 
                    of slaves and men of the baser sort; nor,beginning with the 
                    rhythms and gestures of freemen, would theyassign to them 
                    a melody or words which are of an opposite character;nor would 
                    they mix up the voices and sounds of animals and of menand 
                    instruments, and every other sort of noise, as if they were 
                    allone. But human poets are fond of introducing this sort 
                    of inconsistentmixture, and so make themselves ridiculous 
                    in the eyes of those who,as Orpheus says, &quot;are ripe for 
                    true pleasure.&quot; The experienced see allthis confusion, 
                    and yet the poets go on and make still further havocby separating 
                    the rhythm and the figure of the dance from themelody, setting 
                    bare words to metre, and also separating the melodyand the 
                    rhythm from the words, using the lyre or the flute alone.For 
                    when there are no words, it is very difficult to recognize 
                    themeaning of the harmony and rhythm, or to see that any worthy 
                    object isimitated by them. And we must acknowledge that all 
                    this sort of thing,which aims only at swiftness and smoothness 
                    and a brutish noise, anduses the flute and the lyre not as 
                    the mere accompaniments of thedance and song, is exceedingly 
                    coarse and tasteless. The use of eitherinstrument, when unaccompanied, 
                    leads to every sort of irregularityand trickery. This is all 
                    rational enough. But we are consideringnot how our choristers, 
                    who are from thirty to fifty years of age, andmay be over 
                    fifty, are not to use the Muses, but how they are to usethem. 
                    And the considerations which we have urged seem to show inwhat 
                    way these fifty year-old choristers who are to sing, may beexpected 
                    to be better trained. For they need to have a quickperception 
                    and knowledge of harmonies and rhythms; otherwise, howcan 
                    they ever know whether a melody would be rightly sung to theDorian 
                    mode, or to the rhythm which the poet has assigned to it?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Clearly they cannot.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The many are ridiculous in imagining that they know 
                    what isin proper harmony and rhythm, and what is not, when 
                    they can only bemade to sing and step in rhythm by force; 
                    it never occurs to them thatthey are ignorant of what they 
                    are doing. Now every melody is rightwhen it has suitable harmony 
                    and rhythm, and wrong when unsuitable.</p>
                  <p>Cle. That is most certain.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But can a man who does not know a thing, as we were 
                    saying,know that the thing is right?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Impossible.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then now, as would appear, we are making the discovery 
                    that ournewly-appointed choristers, whom we hereby invite 
                    and, although theyare their own masters, compel to sing, must 
                    be educated to such anextent as to be able to follow the steps 
                    of the rhythm and the notesof the song, that they may know 
                    the harmonies and rhythms, and be ableto select what are suitable 
                    for men of their age and character tosing; and may sing them, 
                    and have innocent pleasure from their ownperformance, and 
                    also lead younger men to welcome with dutiful delightgood 
                    dispositions. Having such training, they will attain a moreaccurate 
                    knowledge than falls to the lot of the common people, or evenof 
                    the poets themselves. For the poet need not know the third 
                    point,viz., whether the imitation is good or not, though he 
                    can hardlyhelp knowing the laws of melody and rhythm. But 
                    the aged chorus mustknow all the three, that they may choose 
                    the best, and that which isnearest to the best; for otherwise 
                    they will never be able to charmthe souls of young men in 
                    the way of virtue. And now the originaldesign of the argument 
                    which was intended to bring eloquent aid to theChorus of Dionysus, 
                    has been accomplished to the best of ourability, and let us 
                    see whether we were right:-I should imagine that adrinking 
                    assembly is likely to become more and more tumultuous asthe 
                    drinking goes on: this, as we were saying at first, will certainlybe 
                    the case.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Every man has a more than natural elevation; his heart 
                    isglad within him, and he will say anything and will be restrained 
                    bynobody at such a time; he fancies that he is able to rule 
                    over himselfand all mankind.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Quite true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Were we not saying that on such occasions the souls 
                    of thedrinkers become like iron heated in the fire, and grow 
                    softer andyounger, and are easily moulded by him who knows 
                    how to educate andfashion them, just as when they were young, 
                    and that this fashioner ofthem is the same who prescribed 
                    for them in the days of their youth,viz., the good legislator; 
                    and that he ought to enact laws of thebanquet, which, when 
                    a man is confident, bold, and impudent, andunwilling to wait 
                    his turn and have his share of silence and speech,and drinking 
                    and music, will change his character into theopposite-such 
                    laws as will infuse into him a just and noble fear,which will 
                    take up arms at the approach of insolence, being thatdivine 
                    fear which we have called reverence and shame?</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And the guardians of these laws and fellow-workers with 
                    themare the calm and sober generals of the drinkers; and without 
                    theirhelp there is greater difficulty in fighting against 
                    drink than infighting against enemies when the commander of 
                    an army is nothimself calm; and he who is unwilling to obey 
                    them and thecommanders of Dionysiac feasts who are more than 
                    sixty years of age,shall suffer a disgrace as great as he 
                    who disobeys militaryleaders, or even greater.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Right.</p>
                  <p>Ath. If, then, drinking and amusement were regulated in this 
                    way,would not the companions of our revels be improved? they 
                    would partbetter friends than they were, and not, as now enemies. 
                    Their wholeintercourse would be regulated by law and observant 
                    of it, and thesober would be the leaders of the drunken.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I think so too, if drinking were regulated as you propose.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us not then simply censure the gift of Dionysus 
                    as badand unfit to be received into the State. For wine has 
                    manyexcellences, and one pre-eminent one, about which there 
                    is adifficulty in speaking to the many, from a fear of their 
                    misconceivingand misunderstanding what is said.</p>
                  <p>Cle. To what do you refer?</p>
                  <p>Ath. There is a tradition or story, which has somehow crept 
                    aboutthe world, that Dionysus was robbed of his wits by his 
                    stepmotherHere, and that out of revenge he inspires Bacchic 
                    furies and dancingmadnesses in others; for which reason he 
                    gave men wine. Suchtraditions concerning the Gods I leave 
                    to those who think that theymay be safely uttered; I only 
                    know that no animal at birth is matureor perfect in intelligence; 
                    and in the intermediate period, in whichhe has not yet acquired 
                    his own proper sense, he rages and roarswithout rhyme or reason; 
                    and when he has once got on his legs he jumpsabout without 
                    rhyme or reason; and this, as you will remember, hasbeen already 
                    said by us to be the origin of music and gymnastic.</p>
                  <p>Cle. To be sure, I remember.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And did we not say that the sense of harmony and rhythmsprang 
                    from this beginning among men, and that Apollo and the Musesand 
                    Dionysus were the Gods whom we had to thank for them?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The other story implied that wine was given man out 
                    of revenge,and in order to make him mad; but our present doctrine, 
                    on thecontrary, is, that wine was given him as a balm, and 
                    in order toimplant modesty in the soul, and health and strength 
                    in the body.</p>
                  <p>Cle. That, Stranger, is precisely what was said.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then half the subject may now be considered to have 
                    beendiscussed; shall we proceed to the consideration of the 
                    other half?</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is the other half, and how do you divide the subject?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The whole choral art is also in our view the whole ofeducation; 
                    and of this art, rhythms and harmonies form the partwhich 
                    has to do with the voice.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The movement of the body has rhythm in common with the 
                    movementof the voice, but gesture is peculiar to it, whereas 
                    song is simplythe movement of the voice.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Most true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And the sound of the voice which reaches and educates 
                    the soul,we have ventured to term music.</p>
                  <p>Cle. We were right.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And the movement of the body, when regarded as an amusement, 
                    wetermed dancing; but when extended and pursued with a view 
                    to theexcellence of the body, this scientific training may 
                    be calledgymnastic.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Exactly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Music, which was one half of the choral art, may be 
                    said tohave been completely discussed. Shall we proceed to 
                    the other halfor not? What would you like?</p>
                  <p>Cle. My good friend, when you are talking with a Cretan andLacedaemonian, 
                    and we have discussed music and not gymnastic, whatanswer 
                    are either of us likely to make to such an enquiry?</p>
                  <p>Ath. An answer is contained in your question; and I understand 
                    andaccept what you say not only as an answer, but also as 
                    a command toproceed with gymnastic.</p>
                  <p>Cle. You quite understand me; do as you say.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I will; and there will not be any difficulty in speakingintelligibly 
                    to you about a subject with which both of you are farmore 
                    familiar than with music.</p>
                  <p>Cle. There will not.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Is not the origin of gymnastics, too, to be sought in 
                    thetendency to rapid motion which exists in all animals; man, 
                    as wewere saying, having attained the sense of rhythm, created 
                    and inventeddancing; and melody arousing and awakening rhythm, 
                    both unitedformed the choral art?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And one part of this subject has been already discussed 
                    byus, and there still remains another to be discussed?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Exactly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I have first a final word to add to my discourse about 
                    drink,if you will allow me to do so.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What more have you to say?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I should say that if a city seriously means to adopt 
                    thepractice of drinking under due regulation and with a view 
                    to theenforcement of temperance, and in like manner, and on 
                    the sameprinciple, will allow of other pleasures, designing 
                    to gain thevictory over them in this way all of them may be 
                    used. But if theState makes drinking an amusement only, and 
                    whoever likes may drinkwhenever he likes, and with whom he 
                    likes, and add to this any otherindulgences, I shall never 
                    agree or allow that this city or this manshould practise drinking. 
                    I would go further than the Cretans andLacedaemonians, and 
                    am disposed rather to the law of theCarthaginians, that no 
                    one while he is on a campaign should be allowedto taste wine 
                    at all, but that he should drink water during all thattime, 
                    and that in the city no slave, male or female, should ever 
                    drinkwine; and that no magistrates should drink during their 
                    year ofoffice, nor should pilots of vessels or judges while 
                    on duty tastewine at all, nor any one who is going to hold 
                    a consultation about anymatter of importance; nor in the daytime 
                    at all, unless in consequenceof exercise or as medicine; nor 
                    again at night, when any one, eitherman or woman, is minded 
                    to get children. There are numberless othercases also in which 
                    those who have good sense and good laws oughtnot to drink 
                    wine, so that if what I say is true, no city will needmany 
                    vineyards. Their husbandry and their way of life in generalwill 
                    follow an appointed order, and their cultivation of the vine 
                    willbe the most limited and the least common of their employments. 
                    Andthis, Stranger, shall be the crown of my discourse about 
                    wine, ifyou agree.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Excellent: we agree.</p>

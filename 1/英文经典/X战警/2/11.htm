            <p> Where the flame of the torch once stood, now stands Logan, his 
              skeleton cooling down.</p>
            <p> Logan leans on the torch&uml;&ordf;s railing, his chest bleeds 
              from the six claw wounds. Logan is exhausted. He looks down at his 
              comrades still trapped by the metal bands. And Magneto lying powerless 
              on the floor. SUDDENLY, from below --</p>
            <p> A MASSIVE CLAWED HAND strikes Logan&uml;&ordf;s chest. The blow 
              sends Logan sailing back to the far end of the torch.</p>
            <p> Logan lies against the railing. Opening his eyes he sees --</p>
            <p> TWO CLAWED FEET following upward to a very angry, very <br>
              large Sabretooth, towering over him.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth leaps at Logan. Against the New York skyline THEY GO 
              AT IT, SLASHING AND HOWLING.</p>
            <p> EXT. MANHATTAN HARBOR - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Several Coast Guard cutters head full-speed toward Liberty Island.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: Their decks covered with armed Secret Service.</p>
            <p> EXT. TORCH - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Sabretooth picks up Logan over his head and throws him like a 
              rag doll into the railing on the other side of the torch.</p>
            <p> Logan struggles to his feet -- dazed. Suddenly, Sabretooth, running 
              at full steam, tackles him. Slamming Logan into the railing.</p>
            <p> The metal railing bends.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth holds Logan by his wrists, trying to push him over 
              the edge. It is several hundred feet to the ground below.</p>
            <p> Logan is weakening. Sabretooth is in complete control, he leans 
              down near Logan&uml;&ordf;s ear.</p>
            <p> SABRETOOTH<br>
              (whispering)<br>
              Your girlfriend is next.</p>
            <p> With all his might, Logan pushes his clenched fists as close to 
              Sabretooth&uml;&ordf;s face as he can. SHOOK! The claws pop. Sabretooth 
              springs back to protect his face.</p>
            <p> LOGAN KICKS WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND SABRETOOTH flies back to the 
              other side of the torch.</p>
            <p> LOGAN leaps up and running at full speed, tackles Sabretooth -- 
              like a train plowing into a stalled car.</p>
            <p> The metal railing snaps and they both go flying through the air.</p>
            <p> EXT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> CRACK.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth and Logan slam onto the top of the Statue&uml;&ordf;s 
              head.</p>
            <p> Logan rolls off the back of the Statue&uml;&ordf;s head and falls.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth stands and looks over the edge - nothing. All he can 
              see is the Statue&uml;&ordf;s body curving away towards the ground. 
              He smiles, and turns back to the hole.</p>
            <p> EXT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: LOGAN - Hanging from the ear of the Statue, the <br>
              claws of his right hand embedded in the lobe at the end of three 
              sets of long claw-marks.</p>
            <p> He looks up. A look of brutal determination crosses his face. 
              Straining, he pulls himself up by his right arm. The cords stand 
              out on his neck as he tries to get to shoulder level. He aims his 
              left claw a little further up on the ear and --</p>
            <p> THUNK.</p>
            <p> He drives it in.</p>
            <p> INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> WHAM -- E.C.U. Sabretooth&uml;&ordf;s feet as he lands on the 
              metal <br>
              floor. He quickly takes in the situation, Magneto and Rogue are 
              still unconscious. He walks towards Storm.</p>
            <p> The air in the room starts to CRACKLE and Sabretooth&uml;&ordf;s 
              hair begins to stand on end as it did when these two last confronted 
              each other.</p>
            <p> SABRETOOTH<br>
              I don&uml;&ordf;t think so.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth backhands Storm across the jaw, knocking her out. As 
              her head drops, he draws his claws and slashes it down. It STOPS, 
              just before tearing open Storm&uml;&ordf;s throat, HELD BY AN UNSEEN 
              FORCE. He turns and sees that Jean has focused her power in his 
              arm. He smiles.</p>
            <p> He walks to Jean and tears off her bonds. He reaches out to grab 
              her neck but his claw is stopped again in mid- air.abretooth just 
              smiles wider and forces his hand forward. The outcome never really 
              in doubt, the claw wraps around Jean&uml;&ordf;s neck. She begins 
              to choke.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              Jean!</p>
            <p> Sabretooth lifts Jean by the neck and walks away from Cyclops 
              as he chokes her.</p>
            <p> SABRETOOTH<br>
              Sorry about this sweetheart, but I made Logan a promise.</p>
            <p> Jean struggles desperately against Sabretooth&uml;&ordf;s unbreakable 
              grip, the life draining from her. Then --</p>
            <p> LOGAN (O.S.)<br>
              Hey, ya big pussy.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth whips around, still clutching Jean to see - <br>
              LOGAN -</p>
            <p> Bleeding, beaten and panting, and yet still standing defiantly 
              over Magneto&uml;&ordf;s unconscious body.</p>
            <p> LOGAN (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              I ain&uml;&ordf;t finished with you yet.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth looks at him, disbelieving that this man can still 
              be standing, let alone challenging him... and he starts to laugh.</p>
            <p> SABRETOOTH<br>
              You?</p>
            <p> Logan grins.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Not just me.</p>
            <p> And with that: he extends ONE CLAW from his right hand, <br>
              squats down, and cuts the piece of metal holding Cyclops&uml;&ordf; 
              <br>
              visor to Magneto&uml;&ordf;s belt. He lifts it up and it slides 
              down his claw to his hand. He casually throws it in the air. </p>
            <p> LOGAN (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Jean?</p>
            <p> Logan looks at the visor and it freezes in the air.</p>
            <p> It flies across the room, right past Sabretooth&uml;&ordf;s head. 
              He lunges at it with his free claw but just misses it.</p>
            <p> The visor lands square on Cyclops&uml;&ordf; eyes, and attaches 
              itself to Cyclops&uml;&ordf; face.</p>
            <p> He turns.</p>
            <p> BOOM!</p>
            <p> A focused OPTIC BLAST hits Sabretooth like a FREIGHT <br>
              TRAIN. He drops Jean and SLAMS THROUGH THE WALL.</p>
            <p> EXT. STATUE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> We see the side of the Statue&uml;&ordf;s head. Suddenly, Sabretooth 
              BLASTS THROUGH THE EYE.</p>
            <p> For a moment Cyclops&uml;&ordf; beam continues to fire through 
              the <br>
              eye as if the Statue itself is imitating Cyclops&uml;&ordf; power.</p>
            <p> EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Magneto&uml;&ordf;s boat still sits quietly next to the seawall.</p>
            <p> CRASH.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth&uml;&ordf;s body SMASHES THROUGH THE ROOF of the boat. 
              The tarp flies up and drifts back down to rest over <br>
              Sabretooth&uml;&ordf;s body.</p>
            <p> INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Logan&uml;&ordf;s breathing is strained, a blood stain in the 
              middle of his shirt, but he is in control. Logan looks up, his eyes 
              met by Jean&uml;&ordf;s.</p>
            <p> He walks over to Storm and Cyclops and SHOOK! cuts them <br>
              loose. Jean and Cyclops catch Storm, who begins to come <br>
              around.</p>
            <p> Cyclops smiles. Logan kneels down beside Rogue. He wants to comfort 
              her but cannot touch her. She opens her eyes and sees Logan.</p>
            <p> ROGUE<br>
              Hey... There you are. (sudden apprehension) Is it really you?</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              (not quite sure what she&uml;&ordf;s talking about) Yeah, it&uml;&ordf;s 
              really me.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              Come on, let&uml;&ordf;s get out of here.</p>
            <p> Logan stands. He takes a couple of steps before collapsing in 
              Cyclops&uml;&ordf; arms.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              (sliding to the ground)<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;m o.k. I&uml;&ordf;m o.k.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              Sure you are, sport.</p>
            <p> EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - DOCK - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Several Coast Guard cutters and police boats reach the island. 
              Men run across the dock as we pull up --</p>
            <p> EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The Coast Guard, Secret Service, and FBI descend upon the <br>
              island.</p>
            <p> INT. OLD TORCH ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Security enters the smoldering remains of the old torch room. 
              The walls blackened by a past inferno. At the center, Pyro lies 
              motionless in a sea of foam.</p>
            <p> INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Push in on MYSTIQUE who is tied up. Across her feet a crack of 
              light as the door begins to open. Swish pan over to the NYPD entering 
              the room. Swish pan back. Mystique has taken the form of a Secret 
              Service agent.</p>
            <p> AGENT/MYSTIQUE<br>
              Hey, could somebody untie me!</p>
            <p> EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A Secret Service spots the wreckage of Magneto&uml;&ordf;s boat 
              and <br>
              the large tarp which covers it. He pulls his gun.</p>
            <p> SECRET SERVICE MAN #3<br>
              (to other agents)<br>
              Hey! Over here.</p>
            <p> Three other agents pull their guns and aim at the tarp. <br>
              The first agent pulls it back to reveal... nothing. <br>
              Sabretooth is gone.</p>
            <p> INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> NYPD and Secret Service rush up the stairs and into the head. 
              Magneto lies unconscious on the floor.</p>
            <p> The lead guy, an NYPD OFFICER in a flak jacket, holding a <br>
              shotgun, stares up at the ceiling. He peers out through the gaping 
              hole. Beyond the damaged torch the star filled sky is momentarily 
              eclipsed by a aircraft -- the X- Jet. </p>
            <p> The officer turns to say something, but stops -- wondering if 
              his eyes were merely playing tricks on him.</p>
            <p> INT. MANSION - DAY</p>
            <p> Cyclops, Jean, Storm, Rogue and about two dozen students <br>
              all sit in front of a wide screen TV watching the Special Report 
              on the Mutant Registration Act vote.</p>
            <p> As the Anchorman speaks we move over the concerned looks <br>
              on all of their faces.</p>
            <p> ANCHORMAN (O.S.)<br>
              Even after last weeks terrorist vandalization of the Statue of Liberty 
              by an unidentified mutant organization, the outcome of the vote 
              was 51 to 49 in opposition to the Mutant Registration Act.</p>
            <p> A LOUD CHEER as the room erupts into celebration.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              Quiet. Quiet everybody.</p>
            <p> ANCHORMAN<br>
              This narrow defeat was probably due in large part to the surprising 
              last- minute reversal by Senator Scott &uml;&not;Frank? Kelly, who 
              until today provided the loudest voice in the cry for Mutant Registration. 
              Earlier today, Kelly had this to say:</p>
            <p> The TV cuts to a shot of Kelly being grilled by reporters as he 
              walks down the Capitol steps.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              (struggling to get through)<br>
              If we can not go into the future together, the divisions of fear 
              and prejudice will tear this country apart.</p>
            <p> As he is speaking, we cut to:</p>
            <p> INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY</p>
            <p> Kelly pushing past reporters.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              No more questions. Please, no more questions.</p>
            <p> E.C.U. The back of Kelly&uml;&ordf;s neck as he passes. A BLUE 
              <br>
              SCALE is visible above his collar.</p>
            <p> INT. LOGAN&uml;&ordf;S ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> The FAINT CHEERS are heard through the walls.</p>
            <p> HAZY THEN FOCUS INTO -- light pushes through blinds. A <br>
              gentle breeze moves them slightly.</p>
            <p> Logan sits up in his bed, his chest bandaged.</p>
            <p> VRRRIP -- the sound of blinds being pulled open. Bright <br>
              sunshine fills the room, washing across a box and a card sitting 
              on a bureau.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: the card as Logan reads it.</p>
            <p> LOGAN -- WELCOME HOME. It is signed simply, X.</p>
            <p> Logan reaches in the box, pulling out -- a UNIFORM. He lays it 
              on the bed. He pulls on one of the gloves, stretching his fingers 
              in it. Perfect fit.</p>
            <p> SHOOK -- He pops his claws through THREE METAL RINGLETS <br>
              on the back of the glove -- clearly it was made specifically for 
              him.</p>
            <p> Logan looks down into the box for him.</p>
            <p> INT. LOGAN&uml;&ordf;S ROOM - LATER - DAY</p>
            <p> From behind Logan we see him finish putting something on over 
              his head. Logan turns into frame, he is wearing a dark blue MASK.</p>
            <p> It fits his head neatly. The sides arch up shadowing his ears, 
              giving him a wolf or fox-like appearance. The shape is reminiscent 
              of Logan&uml;&ordf;s sketch -- the wolverine.</p>
            <p> Logan stands facing a mirror. The mask looks good on him <br>
              and he seems to know it.</p>
            <p> Xavier is in the doorway.</p>
            <p> Logan pulls off the mask, embarrassed.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Don&uml;&ordf;t you knock?</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              They&uml;&ordf;re all asking how you&uml;&ordf;re doing. Are you 
              feeling up to saying hello to everyone?</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              (pulling the glove off)<br>
              Actually I&uml;&ordf;m feeling up to leaving.</p>
            <p> Logan walks over to the closet and pulls out a shirt. He puts 
              it on.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              (surprised)<br>
              Why? You have a home here now, if you want it. Everyone will...</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              What?... miss me? Charley, I&uml;&ordf;m gonna walk out the front 
              door and trust me, it won&uml;&ordf;t be soon enough for everyone 
              here.</p>
            <p> Logan pulls a duffle bag out of the closet.</p>
            <p> LOGAN (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Can I, umm?</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              Of course. Everything in this room is for you.</p>
            <p> Logan seems genuinely touched by the gesture.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              Thanks, I&uml;&ordf;ll pay you back.</p>
            <p> Logan shoves some clothes into the bag, but not all.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              Well if you&uml;&ordf;re going to leave then you at least owe them 
              a goodbye.</p>
            <p> Logan smirks. He picks up his bag. They exit the room together.</p>
            <p> INT. MANSION - DAY</p>
            <p> The celebration continues unabated. The newscaster on the defeat 
              of the Mutant Registration Act muted, in the background -- Storm, 
              Jean, and Cyclops all sit around a table chatting. Rogue sits on 
              the couch with other students, trying on a new pair of leather gloves.</p>
            <p> XAVIER (O.S.)<br>
              Excuse me. (louder) Excuse me.</p>
            <p> Xavier is in the doorway.</p>
            <p> XAVIER (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Everyone, Logan would like to say...</p>
            <p> Logan steps into the doorway. Everyone can see him now. <br>
              Before Xavier can finish his sentence he is interrupted by --</p>
            <p> APPLAUSE -- simple, genuine, applause.</p>
            <p> Students slowly stand up. Proud of Logan. For he is one of them. 
              He is a mutant. And he is a hero.</p>
            <p> As the unconditional applause echoes around him, Logan seems sincerely 
              touched by their spontaneous outpouring. He is almost choked up 
              -- almost.</p>
            <p> The applause quiet.</p>
            <p> XAVIER (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Well, Logan.</p>
            <p> All eyes are on Logan. Logan pauses. He looks to Xavier, then 
              back to the room.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              What&uml;&ordf;s a guy gotta do to get a beer around here?</p>
            <p> Logan puts his duffle bag down. He walks over to the table with 
              Storm, Cyclops and Jean. Jean smiles at him, so does Cyclops -- 
              his arm around the back of her chair.</p>
            <p> Logan sees them together, they are happy, and finally he offers 
              a smile.</p>
            <p> Xavier holds for a moment at the door. A look of pride on his 
              face, the pride a father has for his children.</p>
            <p> INT. PLASTIC PRISON - DAY</p>
            <p> A CLEAR PLASTIC HALLWAY</p>
            <p> That&uml;&ordf;s right, PLASTIC. Everything we can see -- walls, 
              ceiling, floor -- is made, entirely, of thick, clear plastic.</p>
            <p> DOWN THE HALL TO:</p>
            <p> A THICK PLASTIC CELL</p>
            <p> There, in the middle, at the clear plastic desk, with two clear 
              plastic cups filled with the only thing of color other than the 
              two men in the room.</p>
            <p> Xavier and Magneto.</p>
            <p> They play a friendly game of chess.</p>
            <p> Magneto is notably without his trademark helmet. Two casts encase 
              his legs from his Logan-inflicted injury.</p>
            <p> Xavier is on a modified plastic chair with plastic wheels.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              I wouldn&uml;&ordf;t really have let you die, you know. I just needed...</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              (interrupting) I know.</p>
            <p> Magneto thinks for a while; then:</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Doesn&uml;&ordf;t it ever wake you in the middle of the night? The 
              feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish 
              law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your 
              children? Take you all away?</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              It does indeed, Max.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              And what do you do when you wake up to that?</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that 
              school again looking for trouble.</p>
            <p> He stares right at Magneto.</p>
            <p> Xavier makes a move, Magneto counters. Xavier moves again.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              But you know that it is a war, old friend. And to win a war it takes 
              the will to fight it at all costs, by any means necessary. And for 
              that reason, I will always have the advantage. No <br>
              matter how you trap me, how I am contained -</p>
            <p> Chess pieces seem to visually mimic their conversation <br>
              Xavier&uml;&ordf;s white pieces slowly surrounding Magneto&uml;&ordf;s 
              Black <br>
              King.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              - I will always find an escape.</p>
            <p> XAVIER<br>
              And I will always be there, old friend.</p>
            <p> And with that, Xavier places his queen gently down, taking away 
              a knight.</p>
            <p> XAVIER (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Check.</p>
            <p> Just then, the door to the cell opens. A Guard waits.</p>
            <p> Magneto and Xavier stare at one another before Xavier turns and 
              wheels himself out of the room.</p>
            <p> The door closes behind him, leaving Magneto alone with his plastic 
              chess set in his plastic cell.</p>
            <p> And Magneto looks at the pieces before him. Something occurs to 
              him. He smiles a wicked smile.</p>
            <p> And his rook LEVITATES, despite its properties, moving <br>
              across the board and toppling Xavier&uml;&ordf;s king.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              And mate.</p>
            <p> BLACK</p>

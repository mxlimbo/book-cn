            <p> Cyclops continues to pull on the slime. Jean&uml;&ordf;s struggles 
              are becoming more panicked.</p>
            <p> Cyclops stops and puts his hands on Jean&uml;&ordf;s shoulders, 
              pinning her down.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              Jean. Jean stop. Stop moving.</p>
            <p> Jean continues to struggle for a moment. She starts to calm down, 
              her chest still hitching involuntarily for air.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Jean, trust me. Don&uml;&ordf;t move.</p>
            <p> He takes a hold of her chin and grips it tightly. He FIRES A THIN, 
              FOCUSED OPTIC BEAM INTO THE ENCRUSTED <br>
              SLIME, splitting it in half. He pulls the remains away from her 
              face.</p>
            <p> Jean GASPS for air. Then she looks up. Her face turns to horror. 
              Behind Cyclops, towering over him is -- Sabretooth.</p>
            <p> WHAM! Sabretooth smashes down.</p>
            <p> BLACK</p>
            <p> INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE MUSEUM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Rogue turns the corner of the hallway and trips, tumbling to the 
              ground.</p>
            <p> Rogue watches from the floor as the shadow of her pursuer <br>
              bends around the corner. The sound of their footsteps get closer. 
              The shadow is upon her, turning the corner.</p>
            <p> It is LOGAN.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              I didn&uml;&ordf;t mean to scare you.</p>
            <p> ROGUE<br>
              Thank God. Logan... we have to help Storm we have to.</p>
            <p> Logan looks around to make sure it&uml;&ordf;s clear.</p>
            <p> LOGAN<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;ll go back, but first let me find you a safe place.</p>
            <p> Logan extends his hand.</p>
            <p> LOGAN (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Here, take my hand.</p>
            <p> Rogue looks at Logan confused. Logan grows impatient.</p>
            <p> LOGAN (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Take it!</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: Over Logan&uml;&ordf;s shoulder. On the back of his 
              neck <br>
              we see some BLUE SCALES. Logan is not Logan, Logan is <br>
              MYSTIQUE.</p>
            <p> INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> E.C.U.-on Magneto&uml;&ordf;s belt, which is lined with METAL 
              <br>
              STRAPS. Magneto&uml;&ordf;s hand comes into frame holding CYCLOPS&uml;&ordf; 
              VISOR and places it against one of the straps. The strap WRAPS ITSELF 
              BACK AND AROUND, pinning the visor to the belt. He brings a radio 
              to his mouth.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              (into radio)<br>
              Mystique... Mystique, where are you?</p>
            <p> Magneto turns to Sabretooth.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Find Logan.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth exits as Magneto turns to reveal --</p>
            <p> Jean and Cyclops, without his visor, are trapped in a hideous 
              tangle of metal (taken from the Statue&uml;&ordf;s steel bracing) 
              forcing the two to face each other. Two sharp points of metal rest 
              on either side of Cyclops&uml;&ordf; head, locking it in position. 
              Cyclops&uml;&ordf; is close enough to feel Jean&uml;&ordf;s breath 
              -- if he opens his eyes, he will destroy everything in his path, 
              including Jean.</p>
            <p> Storm is also encased in a myriad of sharp metal bands, pinning 
              her to the wall. Razor sharp pieces of metal warp and close on her 
              throat.</p>
            <p> All in all, they are completely disabled.</p>
            <p> Jean struggles to free them with her telekinesis, to no avail.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              (whispering)<br>
              Jean... can you?</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              (whispering)<br>
              I&uml;&ordf;m sorry. I&uml;&ordf;m not strong enough.</p>
            <p> Magneto stands next to Storm. Close.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              (whispering)<br>
              If the temperature changes a single degree...<br>
              (looking at Jean)<br>
              I only need one hostage.</p>
            <p> Magneto stares icily at Storm.</p>
            <p> As if to accentuate the threat, a piece of metal pokes ever so 
              slightly into the side of Storm&uml;&ordf;s throat.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              (raising his voice)<br>
              Now if you can hear me Logan...</p>
            <p> EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> We find Logan -- The real Logan. He has made it off the Statue 
              and is about to jump off the seawall. He stops suddenly.</p>
            <p> E.C.U. of his ear. His powerful hearing enables him to hear Magneto.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (V.O.)<br>
              ... and I know you can -- It is a five minute run from the furthest 
              distance on this island. If you are not back in this time... I will 
              kill these friends of Xavier&uml;&ordf;s. Including the young lady 
              from the gymnasium. I think they came here to &uml;&not;rescue you.?</p>
            <p> INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Magneto looks to his hand -- the CHIP from Cerebro.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              I also have a small piece of Cerebro that might be of interest to 
              you, if you hope to save Charles Xavier.</p>
            <p> EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (V.O.)<br>
              Xavier is dying you know. Five minutes Logan.</p>
            <p> Logan&uml;&ordf;s face shows the frustration. Again, he is forced 
              to make a decision.</p>
            <p> INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Magneto pulls out the chip taken from Cerebro and walks over to 
              Jean.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Here -- Xavier&uml;&ordf;s life.</p>
            <p> He tucks it in an exposed part of her uniform.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              If I get what I want, you can try and save him... for old times 
              sake.</p>
            <p> Magneto turns to Storm.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Now... shall we talk about the weather.</p>
            <p> INT. ELLIS ISLAND - MAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The President addresses the audience. We move across all the world&uml;&ordf;s 
              leaders sitting with their families. Men, women and children of 
              every race, color and creed that the planet Earth has to offer.</p>
            <p> INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              Magneto. I&uml;&ordf;ve seen the results of your machine. I&uml;&ordf;ve 
              seen Senator Kelly.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Ahhhh, so the good Senator survived his fall? And the swim to shore? 
              He is stronger than I ever could have imagined.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              The experiment was a failure. Kelly didn&uml;&ordf;t make it. Yes, 
              you were successful in activating his mutator gene, but you failed 
              to take into account the rest of his body -- it wasn&uml;&ordf;t 
              ready for the strain. Kelly was dead within hours. Your machine 
              kills.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Quiet...</p>
            <p> Magneto pauses. Shock registering on his face that he could be 
              wrong. Thinking. Considering what Jean is telling him. His mind 
              races and calculates the possibility. Then:</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              I don&uml;&ordf;t believe you.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              You don&uml;&ordf;t understand.</p>
            <p> Magneto gets angry -- squeezing the metal surrounding Jean&uml;&ordf;s 
              head. Jean gasps. This drives Cyclops crazy, but he is helpless 
              to stop it.</p>
            <p> CYCLOPS<br>
              (yelling)<br>
              Stop it!</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Why can&uml;&ordf;t you see what I am trying to do? Why do you stand 
              in my way?</p>
            <p> Magneto&uml;&ordf;s anger is boiling over.</p>
            <p> THUD -- the sound of footsteps, then another and another. The 
              faces around the room look at the stairs as the footsteps get closer 
              and louder.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Check and mate.</p>
            <p> PAUSE.</p>
            <p> SUDDENLY: SHOOK -- Logan&uml;&ordf;s claws shoot up through the 
              <br>
              floor, and through Magneto&uml;&ordf;s feet. Magneto howls. The 
              claws retract and Magneto falls.</p>
            <p> Magneto, writhes in pain, rolling onto his stomach.</p>
            <p> Logan quickly comes up the stairs and into the Statue&uml;&ordf;s 
              head. He stands over the crippled Magneto.</p>
            <p> Logan turns to Jean who is still pressed eye to eye with <br>
              Cyclops. He is relieved to see her alive.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: Storm. She sees something. Several of the steel bands 
              that support the top of the Statue&uml;&ordf;s head begin to move.</p>
            <p> STORM<br>
              Logan!</p>
            <p> THREE METAL BAND peel off the ceiling, coming to life with magnetic 
              energy. They leap across the room and wrap around Logan. Forcing 
              his fists to press against his chest.</p>
            <p> Should he so much as extend his claws, he will rupture his own 
              vitals. The metal bands wrap behind his back.</p>
            <p> Magneto raises his hand and MAGNETIC WAVES RIPPLE. Metal groans 
              as Magneto peels open a gaping hole in the top of <br>
              Lady Liberty&uml;&ordf;s head. Magneto looks up at the torch. The 
              wind howls.</p>
            <p> The AIR RIPPLES again as Magneto levitates the steel bands holding 
              Logan, lifting Logan off the ground and out the hole in the Statue&uml;&ordf;s 
              head.</p>
            <p> EXT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> MAGNETIC WAVES thrust Logan through the air and --</p>
            <p> INT. TORCH - NIGHT</p>
            <p> WHAM -- THROUGH the metal skin of the flame. Logan lands <br>
              in the center of the sphere on top of the machine.</p>
            <p> Inside the sphere is a metal structure resembling the model of 
              an atom. Its rings expand as it receives Logan.</p>
            <p> Logan looks through the hole in the frame, down into the hole 
              in the Statue&uml;&ordf;s head, at Magneto.</p>
            <p> INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Magneto struggles to his feet, pulling himself up by his hands. 
              Magneto stares at Logan, impatient.</p>
            <p> Magneto stands with a hand raised up toward the machine. Then 
              a slight motion of his wrist --</p>
            <p> INT. TORCH - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The rings start revolving just as it did with Kelly, back at the 
              lair. Spinning slowly, then gaining in speed.</p>
            <p> The air around it RIPPLES, gaining in intensity.</p>
            <p> INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> MAGNETIC ENERGY POURS from Magneto&uml;&ordf;s hands toward the 
              machine, behind him Jean and Storm watch helplessly.</p>
            <p> INT. TORCH - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The rings are spinning around Logan at such a speed, the rings 
              themselves are no longer visible -- merely a blur around the stationary 
              Logan.</p>
            <p> Logan yells. Unthinkable pain, his skeleton beginning to glow 
              through his skin.</p>
            <p> His eyes look down, through the hole in the torch, into the Statue&uml;&ordf;s 
              head, searching for Jean.</p>
            <p> The deafening whine builds louder and louder.</p>
            <p> INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Magneto looks at the incredible displays as MAGNETIC <br>
              ENERGY flows from his hands continuing to charge the <br>
              machine.</p>
            <p> Mystique emerges from the stairwell behind Magneto. Her <br>
              eyes widen in awe.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Ahh, there you are.</p>
            <p> Mystique walks slowly toward magneto. Storm and Jean watch the 
              torch in horror.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              (to Mystique)<br>
              You have to stop him, the machine... it kills people...</p>
            <p> Mystique ignores Jean. She stops behind Magneto. She looks up 
              and sees Logan staring back in agony.</p>
            <p> JEAN (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              ... Please do something.</p>
            <p> Magneto tilts his head slightly, acknowledging Jean, but not moving 
              from his task.</p>
            <p> MYSTIQUE<br>
              Don&uml;&ordf;t listen to her... it&uml;&ordf;s a trap.</p>
            <p> Magneto turns.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              What is?</p>
            <p> MYSTIQUE<br>
              This is.</p>
            <p> And she grabs the sides of his face and kisses him deeply. There 
              is an awkward moment. Until:</p>
            <p> MAGNETO CONVULSES. Once, then again. Then he struggles to be set 
              free.</p>
            <p> And MYSTIQUE TRANSFORMS INTO ROGUE.</p>
            <p> It has been her all along, using SHAPE SHIFTING powers <br>
              borrowed from the real Mystique.</p>
            <p> Magneto fights to get free, but his power is being <br>
              drained from him.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              ROGUE, DESTROY THE MACHINE!</p>
            <p> Rogue goes to pull away, BUT MAGNETO WON&uml;&ordf;T LET HER GO.</p>
            <p> Magneto grabs hold of Rogue&uml;&ordf;s throat -- CHOKING HER.</p>
            <p> INT. TORCH - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Logan looking down, through the hole in the Statue&uml;&ordf;s 
              head <br>
              for Jean, sees Rogue and Magneto struggle.</p>
            <p> Logan watches helplessly as MAGNETO STRANGLES ROGUE.</p>
            <p> LOGAN YELLS -- THE WHITE LIGHT BEGINS TO EMANATE FROM HIS BODY. 
              His flesh starts to SMOLDER.</p>
            <p> INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Magneto is strangling Rogue, who clings to his face -- drawing 
              his powers.</p>
            <p> The walls GROAN as magnetic energy RIPPLES through the <br>
              Statue&uml;&ordf;s head.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Rogue, choking to death, looks frantically at Cyclops for help. 
              She raises one of her hands and uses Magneto&uml;&ordf;s stolen 
              power to BEND BACK THE METAL POINTS so that Cyclops is able to move 
              his head again. Without his visor however, he is still unable to 
              open his eyes.</p>
            <p> Magneto, feeling the last of his power draining from him, grabs 
              Rogue tightly and SLAMS her into the wall. Rogue slumps in Magneto&uml;&ordf;s 
              arms and the two collapse to the ground.</p>
            <p> INT. TORCH - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The sound from the machine is DEAFENING. SUDDENLY --</p>
            <p> SILENCE.</p>
            <p> ABSOLUTE SILENCE.</p>
            <p> At the silence, all eyes turn to the torch. </p>
            <p> It is too late -- THE MACHINE IS FULLY CHARGED.</p>
            <p> Logan&uml;&ordf;s eyes tense. He clenches his teeth. Logan does 
              the unthinkable.</p>
            <p> SHOOK.</p>
            <p> The glowing white claws extend through Logan&uml;&ordf;s chest 
              and <br>
              out his back cutting three metal straps binding him. Logan ROARS 
              in pain as he --</p>
            <p> Pulls his claws from his chest.</p>
            <p> SLASH -- his claws rip through the inside of the machine -<br>
              - cutting apart the rings spinning around him.</p>
            <p> The translucent torch of the Statue is CUT TO PIECES BY <br>
              THE FLYING METAL.</p>
            <p> INT. ELLIS ISLAND - GREAT HALL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The President and the dignitaries turn. Secret Service rush to 
              the window. A wave of panic sweeps the crowd.</p>
            <p> INT. SECURITY CONTROL CENTER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The flaming torch lights up one of many screens.</p>

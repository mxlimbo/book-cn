              EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY</p>
            <p> An angry mob outside the Senate hearing. Voices roar in dissent 
              when Jean emerges, coming down the steps without hesitation.</p>
            <p> She sees signs condemning mutants, a scarce few supporting them.</p>
            <p> A group of reporters are behind her and more meet her in front, 
              closing her in. Microphones are shove in her face.</p>
            <p> REPORTERS/VARIOUS<br>
              Dr. Grey, how do you feel about the <br>
              Senator's Statement / How is the <br>
              mutant community reacting? Is it true <br>
              that mutants are dangerous? / Is there <br>
              a mutant plot to overthrow the <br>
              government?</p>
            <p> She ignores them all, trying to push through.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> A KID IN THE CROWD holding a full can of Coke. Smiling <br>
              to his friend beside him. He fires it over the heads of everyone 
              toward Jean. Perfect trajectory. Closing fast.</p>
            <p> Suddenly:</p>
            <p> Silence falls over the crowd. A total silence. An absolute silence.</p>
            <p> All eyes watch in awe at the can and its liquid trail, frozen 
              in mid-air a few inches from Jean's face. It simply hovers there.</p>
            <p> JEAN<br>
              We&uml;&ordf;re not the ones to be afraid of.</p>
            <p> Using telekinesis she slowly lowers the can to the ground. She 
              shakes her head, almost ashamed of the display. Almost as if to 
              say &uml;&not;I didn&uml;&ordf;t want to do that.?</p>
            <p> The can rolls down the steps. People move away from it as though 
              the can itself were dangerous.</p>
            <p> The crowd steps back in genuine fear. Jean simply moves <br>
              ahead now, unimpeded, still shaking her head.</p>
            <p> EXT. CABIN IN THE SNOW COVERED WILDERNESS - DAY</p>
            <p> Smoke curling from the chimney, warm light emanating from <br>
              the window.</p>
            <p> A well-worn pick-up truck parked axles deep in the snow, the back 
              filled with a cord of cut wood. A hand painted scrawl on the door 
              reads:</p>
            <p> Firewood for Sales</p>
            <p> A slope, just behind the cabin leading to a frozen lake.</p>
            <p> PUSH IN SLOWLY TOWARDS THE CABIN. Ten beers sit cooling in the 
              snow outside the door. We hear LED ZEPPELIN&uml;&ordf;S &uml;&not;BLACK 
              DOG.? </p>
            <p> INT. CABIN - DAY</p>
            <p> Music thunders, quite a contrast to the surroundings. A cosy little 
              abode, showing signs of neglect, as though decorated with a gentler 
              touch that passed not too long ago.</p>
            <p> A large shelf replete with books. An electric mix from Sun Tsu&uml;&ordf;s 
              The Art of War to Mark Twain&uml;&ordf;s The Adventures of Huckleberry 
              Finn.</p>
            <p> A fire burns in the fireplace. On the mantle sit a few old black 
              and white photos of a slightly younger Logan posing with a group 
              of HARD-CASE MILITARY TYPES in a heavily wooded area. We can not 
              tell if they are true Military or simply mercenaries.</p>
            <p> In the wall above the mantle, a sketch of a beautiful woman.</p>
            <p> And finally we come to the occupant of the house, sitting at the 
              only table in the center of the room. His back is to us. His hair 
              is coarse and black, sprouting wildly from his head. He is LOGAN. 
              We will come to know him well. As well as we can. </p>
            <p> Despite the loud, pounding music, he is working with the <br>
              meticulousness of a watch maker. At the same time, he smokes a thick 
              cigar. A tall bottle of beer on the floor next to his chair. A SINGLE, 
              SILVER DOG TAG hangs from his neck from a battered chain. As we 
              get closer, we look over his shoulder and see what he is working 
              on so intensely.</p>
            <p> Pencil rubs against paper furiously. He is sketching, what we 
              cannot see. But he is definitely caught up in his own minds eye.</p>
            <p> HIS HEAD SUDDENLY TURNS. He listens to something we <br>
              cannot begin to hear. A momentary pause, and he goes back to sketching.</p>
            <p> Just as he seems to be settling back into the details again.</p>
            <p> WHACK</p>
            <p> He reaches over and shuts off the music coming from the box beside 
              him. He listens.</p>
            <p> He stands, turning around slowly in a circle. He drops the sketch 
              pad on the chair.</p>
            <p> Only the crackle of logs in the fire.</p>
            <p> LOGAN&uml;&ordf;S P.O.V.</p>
            <p> We follow his gaze around the room. Past the fire which sounds 
              suddenly like a blazing inferno, past the clock which ticks as loud 
              as clapping hands, past the simmering tea-kettle which hisses like 
              a seething cauldron. Finally, he glances at the cigar which we hear 
              crackling nearly as loud as the fire.</p>
            <p> Logan&uml;&ordf;s senses are amplified many times more then ours, 
              he walks to the door.</p>
            <p> E.C.U.</p>
            <p> His nostrils flare.</p>
            <p> He raises his fist beside his face. For a moment, it seems as 
              if he is just chinking. Then -- SHOOK - THREE STEELY CLAWS some 
              nine inches long, emerge inexplicably from the skin just above Logan&uml;&ordf;s 
              knuckles.</p>
            <p> Logan barley turns his head before.</p>
            <p> BOOM</p>
            <p> THE WINDOW EXPLODES, letting in freezing wind and <br>
              billowing snow.</p>
            <p> Logan is hit from behind.</p>
            <p> The attack is so ferocious that we are unable to make out the 
              attacker. Whatever it is, it is HUGE. We can hear it snarling and 
              see flashes of its claws as it slams Logan back.</p>
            <p> EXT. CABIN - DAY</p>
            <p> The front door SMASHES OPEN. The two combatants roll <br>
              madly down the hill obscured by flying snow.</p>
            <p> Finally, we see Logan separate from his attacker and CRASH THROUGH 
              THE ICE of the frozen lake.</p>
            <p> E.C.U. - A MASSIVE CLAW-LIKE HAND lifts into frame the <br>
              SHINING DOG TAG hanging from it. The tag&uml;&ordf;s chain slides 
              <br>
              off and too the ground.</p>
            <p> UNDER ICE</p>
            <p> Logan struggles, already short of breath.</p>
            <p> As he struggles -- water starts to fill his lungs. His skin goes 
              pale. He is drowning.</p>
            <p> EXT. ABOVE ICE - DAY</p>
            <p> We hear an angry grunt as the thing starts to hunt for Logan. 
              It stalks across the ice, searching. We catch a glimpse of shoulder, 
              a CLAWED FOOT, a MANE OF HAIR.</p>
            <p> UNDER ICE</p>
            <p> Logan&uml;&ordf;s struggle has decreased somewhat as his strength 
              <br>
              wanes.</p>
            <p> CRACK</p>
            <p> The ice above Logan shatters as a clawed hand reaches <br>
              through.</p>
            <p> EXT. ABOVE ICE - DAY</p>
            <p> A violent YANK. The ice gives way to the soaked and half-<br>
              frozen Logan.</p>
            <p> The creature picks Logan up by his face, CUTTING DEEPLY <br>
              into his cheek, and holds him up like a rag doll. The two are face 
              to face. This is called SABRETOOTH. The reasons are obvious.</p>
            <p> Teeth like said animal and cat&uml;&ordf;s eyes to match.</p>
            <p> A mutant, certainly a member of a class remote in the extreme.</p>
            <p> And then it speaks.</p>
            <p> SABRETOOTH<br>
              It&uml;&ordf;s not gonna be that easy.</p>
            <p> Logan, half-drowned, opens his eyes and looks right at Sabretooth 
              as though he&uml;&ordf;s going to say something. Instead, a LUNG-FULL 
              OF WATER comes shooting out.</p>
            <p> With that, Sabretooth ROARS, as he hoists Logan up and <br>
              throws him. Logan flies nearly ten yards. He lands head first.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth skulks over to him.</p>
            <p> With the sound of Sabretooth&uml;&ordf;s breathing comes the rising 
              <br>
              of the wind...</p>
            <p> Snow from the ground begins to swirl in the bitter cold air.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth is nearly upon Logan now and the wind rises further, 
              until he must shield his eyes from the bitter icy air.</p>
            <p> As he approaches, we see a fresh cut on Logan&uml;&ordf;s face 
              <br>
              HEALING BEFORE OUR VERY EYES, leaving not so much as a scratch. 
            </p>
            <p> THEN:</p>
            <p> A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHT</p>
            <p> Lightning. No. Lightning is not red.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth looks around, puzzled, then down at Logan&uml;&ordf;s 
              <br>
              motionless body. Then to his feet where a hole in the ice sprouts 
              bubbling water.</p>
            <p> The wind blows so violently now that he nearly misses two <br>
              figures standing only a few yards away - mere silhouettes in the 
              icy haze.</p>
            <p> A closer look tells us it is a man and a woman, THEY WEAR <br>
              STRANGE UNIFORMS of form-fitting material - the man wears a reflective 
              visor that hides his eyes. The woman&uml;&ordf;s face <br>
              is care revealing dark skin, penetrating eyes and unusual white 
              hair.</p>
            <p> ANOTHER FLASH - one that seems to come from the man&uml;&ordf;s 
              <br>
              visor itself. An intense beam of red light.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth looks down and sees the ice at his feet has <br>
              broken away.</p>
            <p> He plunges through the ice like a mark in a carnival dunking tank. 
              His massive weight and hairy coat quickly suck him down.</p>
            <p> The TWO FIGURES - CYCLOPS (Scott Summers) AND STORM <br>
              (Ororo Munroe) - obviously two of the children we saw earlier now 
              grown - move over the hole and calmly watch Sabretooth gather himself 
              and swim back to the surface.</p>
            <p> Storm looks down at the hole, concentrating her intense gaze. 
              The wind whips further and the water in the hole begins to freeze 
              over.</p>
            <p> UNDER THE ICE</p>
            <p> Sabretooth wisely concedes.</p>
            <p> With one last look at the two mysterious figures now nearly obscured 
              by the ice, he turns his body and swims away with the same agility 
              he had on land.</p>
            <p> ABOVE THE ICE</p>
            <p> THE SNOW AND WIND ARE NOW VIOLENTLY RAGING</p>
            <p> Cyclops and Storm walk over to Logan and look down at him <br>
              curiously.</p>
            <p> LOGAN&uml;&ordf;S P.O.V.</p>
            <p> They look at one another, wondering. Above them, a black <br>
              shape looms into frame, bringing with it the whining of <br>
              jet engines.</p>
            <p> This is the X-JET and it is like no other plane we have seen before.</p>
            <p> Logan&uml;&ordf;s eyes begin to close as they obscure the last 
              of all perceptible detail.</p>
            <p> INT. CAVERNOUS ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> CLOSE UP ON:</p>
            <p> The Periodic Table of Elements. A chart made up of blocks depicting 
              the elements and their chemical symbols.</p>
            <p> Among the standards like Gold (Au) and Iron (I) and Oxygen (O2) 
              is a new square on simple red construction paper tacked to the top. 
            </p>
            <p> It contains simply a large letter &uml;&not;A.?</p>
            <p> TRACKING SHOT THROUGH:</p>
            <p> We are in a laboratory of sorts, quite different from any we have 
              ever seen -- and so are its occupants.</p>
            <p> MORTIMER TOYNBEE, a dim, loyal thug whose agile leaping <br>
              ability and superhuman strength have earned him the name <br>
              TOAD.</p>
            <p> Across the room, JOHN ALLERDYCE, a wiry redhead whose <br>
              ability to control fire with his fingers has earned him the name 
              PYRO.</p>
            <p> In the corner we see BLOB, no explanation needed, devouring a 
              BUCKET of cereal, preariously balanced on his huge belly.</p>
            <p> They are a bestial and sinister bunch.</p>
            <p> Toad and Pyro are working on:</p>
            <p> A MACHINE</p>
            <p> A fantastic device which occupies a hallowed space in this lab. 
              It is meticulously designed, and with its intricate circuitry, wires, 
              and power boards, it resembles most closely (and only resembles, 
              because truly it&uml;&ordf;s like nothing we&uml;&ordf;ve ever seen 
              before) a combination of an upright torpedo and a fantastic light 
              source -- only far more dark and foreboding.</p>
            <p> Pyro holds a stick of solder in one hand. He lights a lighter 
              with the other, then drops it. Strange thing -- the flame remains 
              hovering about his finger. Quickly the flame intensifies and turns 
              blue, melting the solder over a small circuit board. Then, the flame 
              is gone.</p>
            <p> He sticks out his hand like a surgeon.</p>
            <p> PYRO<br>
              Hand me the dykes.</p>
            <p> Toad, both hands occupied, flicks his long tongue and grabs a 
              pair of pliers which he rests in Pyro&uml;&ordf;s hand, leaving 
              them slicked with SLIME. The flame in his finger goes out. The slimy 
              coat over the pliers quickly HARDENS, freezing their action.</p>
            <p> PYRO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              I asked you not to do that.</p>
            <p> Blob laughs. Toad shrugs.</p>
            <p> In the background, almost ignored by them, something is on the 
              television. The news.</p>
            <p> NEWSCASTER (O.S.)<br>
              Preparations are nearly completed for <br>
              the upcoming anniversary gala <br>
              celebrating the formation of the <br>
              United Nations. With nearly every <br>
              invitation confirmed, the occasion <br>
              promises to be the largest single <br>
              gathering of world leaders in history.</p>
            <p> The image in the screen is a helicopter shot of ELLIS ISLAND, 
              with Liberty Island and the famous Statue in the background.</p>
            <p> NEWSCASTER (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Ellis Island, once an arrival point <br>
              for thousands of immigrants crossing <br>
              the Atlantic with the hopes of a <br>
              better life, will open its doors <br>
              again. Only this time it will be to <br>
              leaders and their families from over <br>
              200 nations.</p>
            <p> Blob belches his skepticism deafeningly.</p>
            <p> TRACK FURTHER THROUGH THE LAIR AND OUT THE DOOR as the <br>
              Newscast drones on.</p>
            <p> INT. CORRIDOR/OFFICE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> WE MOVE through subterranean corridors and past dozens of <br>
              projects that share some similarity to the machine we have seen, 
              including crude designs that have been rejected or stripped of their 
              good ideas.</p>
            <p> FAINTLY we become aware of a clicking sound. Almost like <br>
              a stopwatch very far away, always growing louder.</p>
            <p> The newscast has faded and another voice is getting closer from 
              somewhere down the hall.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth emerges around a corner heading towards us, <br>
              turning just as we get to him. The clicking is loud and clear now.</p>
            <p> Sabretooth enters an office and we follow him. Seated at a desk 
              in the center of the room is MAX LENSHERR - age - somewhere after 
              sixty, but strong and vital for his years. He is more often called 
              MAGNETO.</p>
            <p> The clicking is from the sound of an executive pendulum thingy 
              on his desk. The six steel balls hang onto one another from string 
              supports in formation depending on how many are let to fly from 
              either end. One ball strikes one and one ball swings out from the 
              other. Two balls and two, and so on.</p>
            <p> Slight difference. There are no strings supporting the balls, 
              thus defying gravity.</p>
            <p> A chess set - all of its pieces made of beautifully crafted iron 
              - sits on the far end of the desk.</p>
            <p> He is watching television, or more accurately listening - his 
              eyes looking off into space, deep in thought.</p>
            <p> INTERVIEWER<br>
              ...and the leading voice in the call <br>
              for Mutant registration is Senator <br>
              Scott Frank Kelly, of Florida, who <br>
              claims to support the constitutional <br>
              rights of the genetically enhanced, <br>
              but whose crusade to register mutants <br>
              is gaining popularity.</p>
            <p> Now Kelly is on the screen. Magneto shakes his head.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Not this one again.</p>
            <p> When Sabretooth clears his throat, the clicking balls instantly 
              freeze and hover there.</p>
            <p> The volume on the television drops, though no remote is in sight.</p>
            <p> Magneto notices Sabretooth&uml;&ordf;s apparent exhaustion, his 
              torn clothing, including the slashes in his side. His look asks 
              &uml;&not;what happened??</p>
            <p> Sabretooth crosses the room and places the shining dog tag on 
              the table. The one he ripped from Logan&uml;&ordf;s neck. He sits 
              at the desk, puzzling over it.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Your expression tells me the news is not good, brother.</p>
            <p> SABRETOOTH<br>
              I lost him.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              How?</p>
            <p> SABRETOOTH<br>
              It was Xavier&uml;&ordf;s people. They knew.</p>
            <p> Frustrated. Magneto inspects the dog tag.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              I want him. That is all they know because that is all you know.</p>
            <p> Nothing odd about the tag at a glance, military dog tag, <br>
              weathered and beaten, but certainly plain, Canadian Military, Logan&uml;&ordf;s 
              name, rank, and a faded serial number. His thumb feels the indention 
              of the word at the bottom of the tag that does not seem to fit here.</p>
            <p> WOLVERINE</p>
            <p> We hear the voice of Senator Kelly on the TV. Kelly is on the 
              screen giving good face.</p>
            <p> As he turns up the television, and again, we don&uml;&ordf;t see 
              how, he places the dog tag on his desk, thinking.</p>
            <p> KELLY<br>
              I think the President&uml;&ordf;s pre-occupation <br>
              with international affairs has drawn <br>
              his attention away from this problem. <br>
              American&uml;&ordf;s deserve the right to decide <br>
              whether they want their children to be <br>
              in school with mutants. To be taught <br>
              by mutants. They also have the right <br>
              to know the dangers. That&uml;&ordf;s the <br>
              purpose of registration. And mark my <br>
              words, if the President isn&uml;&ordf;t strong <br>
              enough to do what needs to be done...</p>
            <p> As the Senator continues we PULL BACK and see Magneto <br>
              watching this. He begins speaking over Kelly&uml;&ordf;s diatribe.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              And you may mark my words, Senator Kelly. All your plotting, all 
              your hatred. I have plans for you. I&uml;&ordf;ve seen you come, 
              and I will see you go.</p>
            <p> As Magneto turns Logan&uml;&ordf;s dog tag between his fingers, 
              we <br>
              can&uml;&ordf;t help but notice FADED PURPLE SERIAL NUMBERS <br>
              TATTOOED IN HIS ARM. <br>
              He then drops the dog tag on the desk, Magneto stands and <br>
              heads for the door, Sabretooth follows. The television shuts off 
              and Magneto waves a hand as though beckoning <br>
              someone to follow. Or some thing.</p>
            <p> He stops and looks back at the dog tag on the desk and waves again. 
              A paper clip just next to the dog tag skips off the desk and into 
              Magneto&uml;&ordf;s hand. He drops it, annoyed and tries again.</p>
            <p> A slight rattle, then nothing more, as though the dog tag were 
              held down by an unimaginable weight.</p>
            <p> He walks over and picks up the dog tag, inspecting it, then trying 
              to bend it. Nothing.</p>
            <p> MAGNETO (cont&uml;&ordf;d)<br>
              Can it be..?</p>
            <p> He puts it back on the desk. Now Magneto concentrates - <br>
              sending a wave of magnetic force that ripples the air around it.</p>
            <p> The tag trembles, but does not budge. He looks at Sabretooth and 
              smiles.</p>
            <p> SABRETOOTH<br>
              Is that what you&uml;&ordf;re looking for?</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              A piece. Only a piece.</p>
            <p> SABRETOOTH<br>
              Is it enough?</p>
            <p> MAGNETO<br>
              Enough for a test.</p>
            <p> And as Magneto looks up at Kelly on the television we:</p>
            <p> PAN OVER TO A BULLETIN BOARD on the wall beside him.</p>
            <p> To a periodic table, smaller than the first. </p>
            <p> But still with that red square and added letter &uml;&not;A?.</p>

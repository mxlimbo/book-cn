                I can't take it anymore. If I don't have Chris, I'm gonna kill 
                myself. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Knoxious, you've gotta calm down. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                No, Charlie. That's just my problem. I've been calm all my life. 
                I'll do something about that. </p>

                Hello? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                She's gonna hate me. The Danburrys will hate me. My parents will 
                kill me. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                All right, goddamn it. You're right. &amp;quot;Carpe diem.&amp;quot; 
                Even if it kills me. </p>

                Hi. This is Knox Overstreet. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Oh, yes. Knox. Glad you called. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                She's glad I called. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Listen, Chet's parents are going out of town this weekend, so 
                he's having a party. Would you like to come? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Would I like to come to a party? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Yes. Say, yes. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Friday? Um- </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Well, sure. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                About seven? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Okay, great. I-I'll be there, Chris. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Okay. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Friday night at the Danburrys'. O-Okay. Thank you. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Okay. Bye. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Thank you. I'll see you. Bye. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Yawp! Can you believe it? She was gonna call me. She invited me 
                to a party with her. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                At Chet Danburrys' house. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Yeah. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Well? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                So? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                So, you don't really think she means you're going with her? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Well, of course not, Charlie. But that's not the point. That's 
                not the point at all. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                What is the point? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                The point, Charlie, is, uh-- </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Yeah? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                -- that she was thinking about me. I've only met her once, and 
                already she's thinking about me. Damn it. It's gonna happen, guys. 
                I feel it. She is going to be mine. Carpe. Carpe! </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                No grades at stake, gentlemen. Just take a stroll. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                There it is. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                I don't know, but I've been told-- </p>
              <p>BOYS<br>
                I don't know, but I've been told-- </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Doing poetry is old-- </p>
              <p>BOYS<br>
                Doing poetry is old-- </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Left, left, left-right-left. Left, left, left-right-left. Left, 
                halt! </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Thank you, gentlemen. If you noticed, everyone started off with 
                their own stride, their own pace. Mr. Pitts, taking his time. 
                He knew he'll get there one day. Mr. Cameron, you could see him 
                thinking, &amp;quot;Is this right? It might be right. It might 
                be right. I know that. Maybe not. I don't know.&amp;quot; Mr. 
                Overstreet, driven by deeper force. Yes. We know that. All right. 
                Now, I didn't bring them up here to ridicule them. I brought them 
                up here to illustrate the point of conformity: the difficulty 
                in maintaining your own beliefs in the face of others. Now, those 
                of you -- I see the look in your eyes like, &amp;quot;I would've 
                walked differently.&amp;quot; Well, ask yourselves why you were 
                clapping. Now, we all have a great need for acceptance. But you 
                must trust that your beliefs are unique, your own, even though 
                others may think them odd or unpopular, even though the herd may 
                go, &amp;quot;That's bad.&amp;quot; Robert Frost said, &amp;quot;Two 
                roads diverged in a wood and I, I took the one less traveled by, 
                and that has made all the difference.&amp;quot; Now, I want you 
                to find your own walk right now. Your own way of striding, pacing. 
                Any direction. Anything you want. Whether it's proud, whether 
                it's silly, anything. Gentlemen, the courtyard is yours. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                You don't have to perform. Just make it for yourself. Mr. Dalton? 
                You be joining us? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Exercising the right not to walk. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Thank you, Mr. Dalton. You just illustrated the point. Swim against 
                the stream. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Todd? Hey. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Hey. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                What's going on? </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Nothing. Today's my birthday. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Is today your birthday? Happy birthday. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Thanks. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                What's you get? </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                My parents gave me this. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Isn't this the same desk set- </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Yeah, yeah. They gave me the same thing as last year. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Oh. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Oh. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Maybe they thought you needed another one. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Maybe they weren't thinking about anything at all. Uh, the funny 
                thing is about this is I, I didn't even like it the first time. 
              </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Todd, I think you're underestimating the value of this desk set. 
                I mean, who would want a football or a baseball, or-- </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Or a car. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Or a car if they could have a desk set as wonderful as this one? 
                I mean, if, if I were ever going to buy a, a desk set twice, I 
                would probably buy this one both times. In fact, its, its shape 
                is, it's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? I can feel it. This desk 
                set wants to fly. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Todd? The world's first unmanned flying desk set. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Oh, my! </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Well, I wouldn't worry. You'll get another one next year. </p>

              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Guys, I have an announcement to make. In keeping with the spirit 
                of passionate experimentation of the Dead Poets, I'm giving up 
                the name Charlie Dalton. From now on, call me Nuwanda. </p>

                Knox! </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Hi. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                You made it. Great! Bring anybody? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                No. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                No. Ginny Danburry's here. Wait. I have to go find Chet. Why don't 
                you go downstairs where everybody is? </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Make yourself at home. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                But I-- </p>
              <p>GUY 1<br>
                Hey, you Mutt Sanders' brother? Bubba, this guy look like Mutt 
                Sanders to you or what? </p>
              <p>BUBBA<br>
                You're his brother? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                No relation. Never heard of him. Sorry, guys. </p>
              <p>BUBBA<br>
                Where's your manners? Mutt Sanders' brother, we don't even offer 
                him a drink. Here. Go have some whiskey, pal. </p>
              <p>GUY 1<br>
                Yeah. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Whoa, I, uh, I don't really drink-- </p>
              <p>BUBBA<br>
                To Mutt. </p>
              <p>GUY 1<br>
                To Mutt. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                To Mutt. </p>
              <p>BUBBA<br>
                Now, how the hell is old Mutt, anyway? </p>
              <p>GUY 1<br>
                Yeah. What's ol' Mutter been up to, huh? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                I don't really know Mutt. </p>
              <p>BUBBA<br>
                To Mighty Mutt. </p>
              <p>GUY 1<br>
                To Mighty Mutt. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                To Mighty Mutt. </p>
              <p>BUBBA<br>
                Well, listen, I gotta go find Patsy. Say hello to Mutt for me, 
                okay? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Will do. </p>

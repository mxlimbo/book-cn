              <p>McALLISTER<br>
                Quite an interesting class you gave today, Mr. Keating. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Sorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister. </p>
              <p>McALLISTER<br>
                Oh, there's no need to apologize. It was very fascinated, misguided 
                though it was. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                You think so? </p>
              <p>McALLISTER<br>
                You take a big risk by encouraging them to become artists, John. 
                When they realize that they're not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or 
                Mozarts, they'll hate you for it. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                We're not talking artist, George. We're talking free thinkers. 
              </p>
              <p>McALLISTER<br>
                Free thinkers at seventeen? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Funny. I never pegged you as a cynic. </p>
              <p>McALLISTER<br>
                Not a cynic. A realist. &amp;quot;Show me the heart unfettered 
                by foolish dreams and I'll show you a happy man.&amp;quot; </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                &amp;quot;But only in their dreams can men be truly free. 'Twas 
                always thus, and always thus will be.&amp;quot; </p>
              <p>McALLISTER<br>
                Tennyson? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                No. Keating. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Hey, I found his senior annual in the library. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Listen to this. &amp;quot;Captain of the soccer team, Editor of 
                the school annual, Cambridge bound, Thigh man, and Dead Poets 
                Society.&amp;quot; </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                &amp;quot;Man most likely to do anything.&amp;quot; </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Thigh man! Mr.&amp;quot;K&amp;quot; was a hell-raiser. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                What's the Dead Poets Society? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I don't know. </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Is there a picture in the annual? </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                No. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Nothing. No other mention of it. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                That boy there, see me after lunch. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Mr. Keating! Mr. Keating! Sir? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Say something. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                O Captain! My Captain! </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Gentlemen. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                We were just looking in your old annual. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Oh, my God. No, that's not me. Stanley &amp;quot;The Tool&amp;quot; 
                Wilson. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                God. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                What was the Dead Poets Society? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                I doubt the present administration would look too favorably upon 
                that. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Why? What was it? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Gentlemen, can you keep a secret? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Sure, yeah. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                The Dead Poets was dedicated to &amp;quot;sucking the marrow out 
                of life.&amp;quot; That's a phrase from Thoreau we would invoke 
                at the beginning of every meeting. You see, we would gather at 
                the old Indian cave and take turns reading from Thoreau, Whitman, 
                Shelly -- the biggies -- even some of our own verse. And, in the 
                enchantment of the moment, we'd let poetry work its magic. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                You mean, it was a bunch of guys sitting around reading poetry? 
              </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                No, Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just guys. We weren't a Greek organization. 
                We were Romantics. We didn't just read poetry, we let it drip 
                from our tongues like honey. Spirits soared, women swooned and 
                gods were created, gentlemen. Not a bad way to spend an evening, 
                eh? Thank you, Mr. Perry, for this stroll down Amnesia Lane. Burn 
                that, especially my picture. </p>

                Dead Poets Society. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                What? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I say we go tonight. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Tonight? </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Now, wait a minute. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Everybody in? </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                Where's this cave he's talking about? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                It's beyond the stream. I know where it is. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                That's miles! </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Sounds boring to me. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Don't come. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Do you know how many demerits we're talking, Dalton? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                So don't come. Please. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Look, all I'm saying is that we have to be careful. We can't get 
                caught. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                No shit, Sherlock. </p>
              <p>HABER<br>
                You boys there, hurry up! </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                All right. Who's in? </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Oh, come on, Neil. Hager's the- </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Forget Hager! No. Who's in? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                I'm in. </p>
              <p>HABER<br>
                I'm warning you! Move! </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Me, too. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                I don't know, Neil. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                What? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Pitts! Pittsie, come on! </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                His grades are hurting, Charlie. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                You can help him, Meeks. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                What is this, a midnight study group? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Forget it, Pitts, you're coming. Meeks, your grades hurting, too? 
              </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                I'll try anything once. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Except sex. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                I'm in as long as we're careful. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                What about you, Knox? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                I don't know, Charlie. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Come on, Knox. I'll help you get Chris. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Yeah? How? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Women swoon! </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                But why do they swoon? Charlie, tell me why they swoon. Charlie! 
              </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                You're not listening. Any questions? Look, you follow the stream 
                to the waterfall. It's right there. It's gotta be like that. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                I don't know. It's starting to sound dangerous. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Oh. Why don't you just stay home? </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Hey, you're crazy. </p>
              <p>McALLISTER<br>
                For God's sake, stop chattering and sit down! </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Todd, are you coming tonight? </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                No. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Why not? God, you were there. You heard Keating. Don't you want 
                to do something about-- </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Y-Yes, but-- </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                But, but what? </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Keating said that everybody took turns reading and I don't wanna 
                do that. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Gosh. You really have a problem with that, don't you? </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                N-No, I, I don't have a problem. Neil, I just-- I don't wanna 
                do it, okay? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                All right. What if you didn't have to read? What if you just came 
                and listened? </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                That's not how it works. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Forget how it works! What if, what if they said it was okay? </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                What? What, are you gonna go up and ask them if-- No, no. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I'll be right back. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Neil? Neil? </p>
              <p>McALLISTER<br>
                Oh, shut up, will you? </p>
              <p>BOY 1<br>
                It's my stuff for my asthma, okay? Could you give that back, please? 
                Could you give that back? </p>
              <p>BOY 2<br>
                What's the matter? Don't you like snakes? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                You're in. </p>
              <p>BOY 1<br>
                Get away from me, okay? </p>
              <p>BOY 3<br>
                Spaz, why don't you check your pockets? </p>
              <p>BOY 4<br>
                Come, Spaz. I have to brush my teeth. </p>
              <p>BOY 5<br>
                Hurry up! Get off. </p>
              <p>HABER<br>
                Cut out that racket in there. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Come on. Let's get out. Go! Go! </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                I'm a dead poet! </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Charlie. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Guys, over here! </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                You're funny. You're real funny. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                It's too wet. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Charlie, you trying to smoke us out of here? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                No, no, the smoke's going right up this opening. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                You okay? </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Oh, God. Clods. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                All right, all right. Forget the fire. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Forget it, forget it. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Lets go, gentlemen. </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Can't light a swamp. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I hereby reconvene the Dead Poets Society, Welton Chapter. The, 
                uh, meetings will be conducted by myself and the other new initiates 
                now present. Uh, Todd Anderson, because he prefers not to read, 
                will keep the minutes of the meetings. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I'll now read the traditional opening message by society member, 
                Henry David Thoreau. &amp;quot;I went to the woods because I wanted 
                to live deliberately. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the 
                marrow of life.&amp;quot; </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                I'll second that. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                &amp;quot;To put to rout all that was not life, and not, when 
                I had come to die, discover that I had not lived.&amp;quot; </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                And, uh, Keating's marked a bunch of other pages. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                All right, intermission. Dig deep. Right here, right here, lay 
                it down. </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                On the mud? We're gonna put our food on the mud? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Meeks, put your coat down. Picnic blanket. </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Yes, sir! Excuse me. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>

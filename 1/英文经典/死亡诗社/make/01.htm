              <p>MOTHER<br>
                Now remember, keep your shoulders back. </p>
              <p>MAN 1<br>
                Okay. Put your arm around your brother. </p>
              <p>MAN 1<br>
                Okay, one more. </p>
              <p>HABER<br>
                Now just to review, you'll follow along with the procession until 
                you get to the headmaster. At that point, he will indicate to 
                you to light the candles of the boys'. </p>
              <p>MAN 2<br>
                All right, boys. Let's settle down. </p>
              <p>MAN 3<br>
                Banners up! </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Ladies and gentlemen, boys, the light of the knowledge. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                One hundred years ago, in 1859, forty-one boys sat in this room 
                and were asked the same question that now greets you at the start 
                of each semester. Gentlemen, what are the four pillars? </p>
              <p>BOYS<br>
                Tradition! Honor! Discipline! Excellence! </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                In her first year, Welton Academy graduated five students. Last 
                year we graduated fifty-one and more than seventy-five percent 
                of those went on to the Ivy League. This, this kind of accomplishment 
                is the result of fervent dedication to the principles taught here. 
                This is why you parents have been sending your sons. This is why 
                we are the best preparatory school in the United States. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                As you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English Department 
                retired last term. You will have the opportunity later to meet 
                his replacement Mr. John Keating, himself an honor's graduate 
                of this school and who, for the past several years, has been teaching 
                at the highly regarded Chester School in London. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Glad you could come by. </p>
              <p>MR. ANDERSON<br>
                Thrilling ceremony as usual, Dr. Nolan. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                You've been away too long. </p>
              <p>MRS. ANDERSON<br>
                Hello, Dr. Nolan. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Good to have you. </p>
              <p>MRS. ANDERSON<br>
                This is our youngest, Todd. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Mr. Anderson, you have some big shoes to fill, young man. Your 
                brother was one of our finest. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Thank you. </p>
              <p>MRS. PERRY<br>
                Lovely ceremony. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Thank you. I'm so glad you liked it. </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Gale. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Tom. </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Good to see you again. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Hello, Mr. Nolan. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Neil, we expect great things from you this year. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Thank you, sir. </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Well, he won't disappoint us. Right, Neil? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I'll do my best, sir. </p>
              <p>FATHER 1<br>
                Come on, son. </p>

                Okay. </p>
              <p>MOTHER 1<br>

              <p>FATHER 1<br>
                No tears now. <br>
                BOY 2<br>
                I don't want to go here. </p>
              <p>MOTHER 2<br>
                Honey, I love you. </p>
              <p>FATHER 1<br>
                I'll walk you over. </p>
              <p>MOTHER 2<br>
                Do your lessons. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Hey. I hear we're gonna be roommates. I'm Neil Perry. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                I'm Todd Anderson. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Why'd you leave Balincrest? </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                My brother went here. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Oh, so you're that Anderson! </p>
              <p>FATHER<br>
                This is for his sinuses. And, oh, if he, if he can't, uh, swallow, 
                you give him one of these. And if he has trouble breathing, you 
                give him-- </p>
              <p>HABER<br>
                All right, fine. </p>
              <p>FATHER<br>
                And, oh, did you remember your vaporizer? And the vapor-- </p>
              <p>BOY<br>
                Hey, how's it going, Neil? </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Neil? Study group tonight? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Yeah, sure. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Business as usual, huh? Hey, I heard you got the new kid. Looks 
                like a stiff. Oops. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Listen. Don't mind Cameron. He's, uh, born with his foot in his 
                mouth. Know what I mean? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Rumor has it you did summer school. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Yep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead. How was 
                your summer, Slick? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Keen. Meeks, door, close. </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Yes, sir. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Gentlemen, what are the four pillars? </p>
              <p>BOYS<br>
                Travesty! Horror! Decadence! Excrement! </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Okay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite flunk English. 
                So if you want, we got our study group. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Sure. Cameron asked me too. Anyone mind including him? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                What's his specialty? Bootlicking? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Uh, he's your roommate. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                That's not my fault. </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Uh, I'm sorry. My name is Stephen Meeks. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Oh, this is Todd Anderson. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Nice to meet you. </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Nice to meet you. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Charlie Dalton. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Knox Overstreet. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Todd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Oh, yeah, sure. Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar. </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Oh, well! Welcome to Hellton. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                It's every bit as tough as they say. Unless you're a genius like 
                Meeks. </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                He flatters me. That's why I'll help him with Latin. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                And English, and trig. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                It's open. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Father, I thought you'd gone. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Mr. Perry, sir. </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Keep your seats, fellas. Keep your seats. Neil, I've just spoken 
                to Mr. Nolan. I think that you're taking too many extracurricular 
                activities this semester. And I've decided that you should drop 
                school annual. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                But I'm the assistant editor this year. </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Well, I'm sorry, Neil. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                But, father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair. </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Fellas? Would you excuse us for a moment? </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Don't you ever dispute me in public! Do you understand? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Father, I wasn't disputing you- </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                After you've finished medical school and you're on your own, then 
                you can do as you damn well please. But until then, you do as 
                I tell you. Is that clear? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Yes, sir. I'm sorry. </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                You know how much this means to your mother, don't you? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Yes, sir. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                You know me. I'm always taking on too much. </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Well, that's my boy. Now, listen. You need anything, you let us 
                know, huh? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Yes, sir. </p>

                What's going on, guys? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                You finked, didn't you, Cameron? </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Finked? I didn't know what the hell you're talking about. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                You told Nolan everything about the club is what I'm talking about. 
              </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Look, in case you hadn't heard, Dalton, there's something called 
                an honor code at this school, all right? If a teacher asks you 
                a question, you tell the truth or you're expelled. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                You little punk! </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Charlie! </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                He's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes, so he rattled to save himself. 
              </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Don't touch him, Charlie. You do and you're out. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                I'm out anyway! </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                You don't know that, not yet. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                He's right there, Charlie. And if you guys are smart, you will 
                do exactly what I did and cooperate. They're not after us. We're 
                the victims. Us and Neil. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                What's that mean? Who are they after? </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Why, Mr. Keating, of course. The &amp;quot;Captain&amp;quot; himself. 
                I mean, you guys didn't really think he could avoid responsibility, 
                did you? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Mr. Keating responsible for Neil? Is that what they're saying? 
              </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Well, who else do you think, dumb ass? The administration? Mr. 
                Perry? Mr. Keating put us up to all this crap, didn't he? If he 
                wasn't for Mr. Keating, Neil would be cozied up in his room right 
                now, studying his chemistry and dreaming of being called doctor. 
              </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                That is not true, Cameron. You know that. He didn't put us to 
                anything. Neil loved acting. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Believe what you want, but I say let Keating fry. I mean, why 
                ruin our lives? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Charlie. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                You just signed your expulsion papers, Nuwanda. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                And if the rest of you are smart, you'll do exactly what I did. 
                They know everything anyway. You can't save Keating, but you can 
                save yourselves. </p>

                Hello, son. </p>
              <p>MRS. ANDERSON<br>
                Hello, darling. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Mom. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Have a seat, Mr. Anderson. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Mr. Anderson, I think we've pretty well put together what's happened 
                here. You do admit to being a part of this Dead Poets Society? 
              </p>
              <p>MR. ANDERSON<br>
                Answer him, Todd. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Yes, sir. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                I have here a detailed description of what occurred at your meetings. 
                It describes how your teacher, Mr. Keating, encouraged you boys 
                to organize this club and to use it as a source of inspiration 
                for reckless and self-indulgent behavior. It describes how Mr. 
                Keating, both in and out of the classroom, encouraged Neil Perry 
                to follow his obsession with acting when he knew all along it 
                was against the explicit order of Neil's parents. It was Mr. Keating's 
                blatant abuse of his position as teacher that led directly to 
                Neil Perry's death. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Read that document carefully, Todd. Very carefully. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                If you've nothing to add or amend, sign it. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                What's gonna happen to Mr. Keating? </p>
              <p>MR. ANDERSON<br>
                I've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd. </p>
              <p>McALLISTER<br>
                Grass is gramen or herba. Lapis is stone. The entire building 
                is aedificium. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Sit. I'll be teaching this class through exams. We'll find a permanent 
                English teacher during the break. Who will tell me where you are 
                in the Pritchard textbook? </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Mr. Anderson. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Uh, in the, in the Pr- </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                I can't hear you, Mr. Anderson. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                In the, in the, in the Pritchard? </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Kindly inform me, Mr. Cameron. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                We skipped around a lot, sir. We covered the Romantics and some 
                of the chapters on Post Civil War literature. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                What about the Realists? </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                I believe we skipped most of that, sir. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                All right, then, we'll start over. What is poetry? </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Come. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Excuse me. I came for my personals. Should I come back after class? 
              </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Get them now, Mr. Keating. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Gentlemen, turn to page 21 of the introduction. Mr. Cameron, read 
                aloud the excellent essay by Dr. Pritchard on &amp;quot;Understanding 
                Poetry.&amp;quot; </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                That page has been ripped out, sir. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Well, borrow somebody else's book. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                They're all ripped out, sir. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                What do you mean, they're all ripped out? </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Sir, we, uh- </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Never mind. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Read! </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                &amp;quot;Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. 
                To fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent with its meter, 
                rhyme and figures of speech, then ask two questions: 1) How artfully 
                has the objective of the poem been rendered and 2)...&amp;quot; 
              </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                &amp;quot;... How important is that objective? Question 1 rates 
                the poem's perfection; question 2 rates its importance. And once 
                these questions have been answered, determining the poem's greatness 
                becomes a relatively simple matter. If the poem's score for perfection 
                is plotted on the horizontal of a graph--&amp;quot; </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Mr. Keating! They made everybody sign it. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Quiet, Mr. Anderson. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                You gotta believe me. It's true. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                I do believe you, Todd. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Leave, Mr. Keating. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                But it wasn't his fault! </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Sit down, Mr. Anderson! One more outburst from you or anyone else, 
                and you're out of this school! Leave, Mr. Keating. I said leave, 
                Mr. Keating. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                O Captain! My Captain! </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Sit down, Mr. Anderson! </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Do you hear me? Sit down! Sit down! This is your final warning, 
                Anderson. How dare you? Do you hear me? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                O Captain! My Captain! </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Mr. Overstreet, I warn you! Sit down! </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Sit down! Sit down. All of you. I want you seated. Sit down. Leave, 
                Mr. Keating. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                All of you, down. I want you seated. Do you hear me? </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Sit down! </p>

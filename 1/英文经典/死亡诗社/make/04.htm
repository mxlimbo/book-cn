                Yeah. Wait a minute. Who gave us half a roll? </p>

                I'm eating the other half. </p>

                It was a dark and rainy night. And this old lady, who had a passion 
                for jigsaw puzzles, sat by herself in her house at her table to 
                complete the new jigsaw puzzle. As she pieced the puzzle together, 
                she realized to her astonishment that the image that was formed 
                was her very own room, and the figure in the center of the puzzle 
                as she completed it was herself. And with trembling hands, she 
                placed the last four pieces and stared in horror at the face of 
                a demented madman at the window. The last thing that this old 
                lady ever heard was the sound of breaking glass. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                No shit. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Yes. This is true. This is true. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                I've got one that's even better than that. I do. There's a young 
                married couple and they're driving through the forest at night 
                from a long trip. And they run out of gas and there's a madman 
                on the loose. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Oh, that thing with the hands? </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                This is the madman on the roof? </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                I love that story. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                I told you that one. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                You did not. I got that in, uh, camp in sixth grade. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Yeah. Were you six last year? </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                &amp;quot;In a mean abode in the Shankill Road lived a man named 
                William Bloat. Now he had a wife, the plague of his life, who 
                continually got his goat. And one day at dawn with her night shift 
                on, he slit her bloody throat.&amp;quot; Oh, and it gets worse.

                Want this? </p>

              <p>NEIL<br>
                You memorized a poem? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                I didn't memorize a poem. Move up. </p>

                And though we are not now that strength which in old days Moved 
                earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;-- One equal temper 
                of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will.

                Exactly! Morose. Now, language was developed for one endeavor, 
                and that is? Mr. Anderson? Come on! Are you a man or an amoeba? 
              </p>

                Mr. Perry? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Uh, to communicate. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                No! To woo women. Today we're going to be talking about William 
                Shakespeare. </p>
              <p>BOY<br>
                Oh, God! </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                I know. A lot of you looked forward to this about as much as you 
                look forward to root canal work. We're gonna talk about Shakespeare 
                as someone who writes something very interesting. Now, many of 
                you have seen Shakespeare done very much like this, &amp;quot;O 
                Titus, bring your friend hither.&amp;quot; But if any of you have 
                seen Mr. Marlon Brando, you know, Shakespeare can be different. 
                &amp;quot;Friend, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.&amp;quot; 
                You can also imagine, maybe, John Wayne as Macbeth going, &amp;quot;Well, 
                is this a dagger I see before me?&amp;quot; </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                &amp;quot;Dogs, sir? Oh, not just now. I do enjoy a good dog once 
                in a while, sir. You can have yourself a three-course meal from 
                one dog. Start with your canine crudites, go to your Fido flambe 
                for main course and for dessert, a Pekingese parfait. And you 
                can pick your teeth with a little paw.&amp;quot; </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Why do I stand up here? Anybody? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                To feel taller. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                No! Thank you for playing, Mr. Dalton. I stand upon my desk to 
                remind yourself that we must constantly look at things in a different 
                way. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                You see, the world looks very different from up here. You don't 
                believe me? Come see for yourself. Come on. Come on! </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Just when you think you know something, you have to look at it 
                in another way. Even though it may seem silly or wrong, you must 
                try! Now, when you read, don't just consider what the author thinks. 
                Consider what you think. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Boys, you must strive to find your own voice. Because the longer 
                you wait to begin, the less likely you are to find it at all. 
                Thoreau said, &amp;quot;Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.&amp;quot; 
                Don't be resigned to that. Break out! Don't just walk off the 
                edge like lemmings. Look around you. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                There! There you go, Mr. Priske. Thank you! Yes! Dare to strike 
                out and find new ground. Now, in addition to your essays, I would 
                like you to compose a poem of your own, an original work. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                That's right! You have to deliver it aloud in front of the class 
                on Monday. Bonne chance, gentlemen. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Mr. Anderson? Don't think that I don't know that this assignment 
                scares the hell out of you, you mole. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Take a power train in two! Three! Keep your eyes in the boat! 
              </p>

                We got it, Pittsie. We got it! Radio Free American! </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I found it. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                You found what? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                What I wanna do right now. What's really, really inside me. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                &amp;quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&amp;quot;? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                This is it. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                What is this? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                It's a play, dummy. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                I know that. I-- Wh-Wh-What does it have to do with you? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Right. They're putting it on at Henley Hall. Open tryouts. Open 
                tryouts! </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Yes, so? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                So, I'm gonna act. Yes, yes! I'm gonna be an actor! Ever since 
                I can remember, I've wanted to try this. I even tried to go to 
                summer stock auditions last year, but, of course, my father wouldn't 
                let me. For the first time in my whole life I know what I wanna 
                do, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants 
                me to or not! Carpe diem! </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Neil, Neil, hold on a minute. How are you gonna be in a play if 
                your father won't let you? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                First I gotta get the part, then I can worry about that. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Yeah, but won't he kill you if he finds out you went to an audition 
                and didn't even tell him? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                No, no, no, no. As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know 
                about any of this. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Well, that's impossible. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Bullshit! Nothing's impossible. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Well, why don't you just call him and ask him? And m-maybe he'll 
                say yes. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                That's a laugh! If I don't ask him, at least I won't be disobeying 
                him. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Yeah, but if he said-- </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Jesus, Todd! Whose side are you on? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I mean, I haven't even gotten the part yet. Can't I even enjoy 
                the idea for a little while? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                You're coming to the meeting this afternoon? </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                I don't know. Maybe. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Nothing Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it, Todd? 
              </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                W-What is that supposed to mean? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                You're in the club! Being in the club means being stirred up by 
                things. You look about as stirred up as a cesspool. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                S-- You want me out? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                No! I want you in, but being in means you gotta do something. 
                Not just say you're in. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Well, listen, Neil. I-I appreciate this concern, but I-I'm not 
                like you. All right? You, you, you say thing and people listen. 
                I'm, I'm not like that. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Don't you think you could be? </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                No! I--I, I don't know, but that's not the point. The, the, the 
                point is that there's nothing you can do about it, so you can 
                just butt out. I can take care of myself just fine. All right? 
              </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                No. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                What do you mean, &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                No. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Give me-- Neil. Neil, give that back. </p>

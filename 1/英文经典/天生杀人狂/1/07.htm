              EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY</p>
            <p>Wayne by himself standing on the courthouse steps.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (to CAMERA)<br>
              No, apparently we had not seen everything. Grace Mulberry gave her 
              tearful testimony. Then it became Mickey Knox's turn for cross-examination.</p>

            <p><br>
              COURT SKETCHES</p>
            <p>An artist SKETCH of Mickey cross-examining Grace on the stand.</p>
            <p>BISBING (V.O.)<br>
              Grace was terrified of Mickey. You have to understand most their 
              victims were normal people with normal lives that nothing out of 
              the ordinary ever happens to.</p>

            <p>Of Mickey looking like the devil himself.</p>
            <p>BISBING (V.O.)<br>
              Then out of the blue, they're dealing with the devil incarnate. 
              It was extremely difficult for us to find survivors who would take 
              the stand and testify when they knew Mickey would be cross-examining 
              them.</p>

              COURT SKETCH</p>
            <p>Of terrified Grace. CAMERA closes in Grace's face.</p>
            <p>BISBING (V.O.)<br>
              Grace was every bit as terrified, every bit as haunted. But she 
              felt her brother Tim and her five girlfriends were counting on her.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. COURTROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>COURT SKETCH - CLOSEUP of Grace staring intently.</p>
            <p>CAMERA widens to include Bisbing standing before the bench as Mickey 
              sits with Mallory at the defence table. Judge Steinsma looks down 
              at Grace. The distinct sounds of a court in session can be heard 
              in the background.</p>
            <p>The color of the scene FADES to Black &amp; White as the CAMERA 
              cranes up to reveal the COURT ARTIST drawing while court is in session.</p>
            <p><br>
              OFF SCREEN:</p>
            <p>Bisbing is wrapping up her examination of Grace who is at the witness 
              stand. Judge Steinsma resides at his bench.</p>
            <p>CAMERA dollies into a MED. OVERHEAD TWO-SHOT of Mickey and Mallory 
              who are sketching on a pad of paper. CAMERA reveals the drawing 
              of a man stabbing a woman. Mickey is doing the actual drawing, but 
              every once and a while Mallory takes to pencil and adds some touches, 
              as Grace finishes her tearful testimony.</p>
            <p>BISBING (O.S.)<br>
              No further questions, your honor.</p>
            <p>Emotional pause, the silence.</p>
            <p>JUDGE STEINSMA (O.S.)<br>
              Would you care to cross examine the witness, Mr. Knox?</p>
            <p>Mickey scratches out the drawing. Still holding the pencil he stands 
              and leaves frame.</p>
            <p>MICKEY (O.S)<br>
              As a matter of fact, your honor, I would.</p>
            <p>NOTE: The following scene is to be played with EXTREME CLOSEUPS. 
              Not once is the courtroom seen in detail. However courtroom sound 
              can be heard vividly in the BACKGROUND.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Mallory, who grins at Mickey like a Cheshire cat.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Grace's eyes as they look downward.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Judge Steinsma as he shuffles paper on his bench.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Mickey's feet crossing the court floor.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Bisbing as her eyes follow Mickey across the court. 
              Mickey enters the frame, with a pencil pressed to his lips in though. 
              Mickey is looking straight into the CAMERA.</p>
            <p>MICKEY'S POV of Grace sitting on the witness stand, staring into 
              her lap.</p>
            <p>EXTREME CLOSEUP of Grace's finger rolling a large, male-style, 
              High School class ring around her palm.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Mickey glancing to the ring. Mickey smiles.</p>
            <p>MICKEY'S POV of Grace as she pulls from a reserve of strength. 
              Clenching the ring tight in her fist, her eyes come up and lock 
              hatefully on Mickey.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Mickey as he walks forward towards Grace.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              That's one helluva story, Miss Mulberry.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Grace.</p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              Yes it is.</p>
            <p>At this point Mickey begins to pace from right to left, but always 
              remaining in CLOSEUP.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Grace... I hope you don't mind if I call you Grace... </p>
            <p>BACK TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              GRACE</p>
            <p>As we DOLLY from a MEDIUM CLOSEUP into a EXTREME CLOSEUP.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your late brother Tim, if you 
              feel up to it.</p>
            <p><br>
              CONTINUE DOLLY:</p>
            <p>Once locked onto her eyes, her head drops forward and we... </p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. GRACE'S HOME - NIGHT</p>
            <p>EXTREME CLOSEUP of Grace's eyes as her head is pulled back into 
              frame.</p>
            <p>Her eyes are wide with fear. The CAMERA pulls back to reveal a 
              gag in her moth and a knife pressed against her throat.</p>
            <p>She's back at the night of the murder.</p>
            <p>Mickey's wearing a black leather jacket over a white T-shirt, which 
              is covered with blood. Blood is smeared on his face, and he's holding 
              a knife pressed to his lips, also covered with blood. But he's walking 
              and talking with the same manner and poise as in the courtroom.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Grace... I hope you don't mind if I call you Grace... </p>
            <p>TWO SHOT revealing that Grace is bound and gagged with Mallory 
              right behind her, holding the knife and cracking gum.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Naw, she don't mind.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, 
              if you feel up to it.</p>

              INT. COURTROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Grace in a daze.</p>
            <p>MICKEY (O.S.)<br>
              Did you get along?</p>
            <p>Mickey waits for an answer that doesn't come.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Miss Mulberry?</p>
            <p>BACK TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              GRACE</p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              More or less.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              More or less... </p>
            <p>BACK TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              MICKEY</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              What do you mean by that?</p>
            <p>BACK TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              GRACE</p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              Well, he's my older brother. When we were growing up, there were 
              times we could of very well done without each other. But when it 
              counted, we were close.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Bisbing listening. Grace is doing better than she thought.</p>
            <p>CAMERA PANS from shadows to find Mickey, the pan continues through 
              his line.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              I'd like to talk about Tim's martial arts abilities. How long had 
              he been studying?</p>
            <p>PAN CONTINUES back into the shadows, then 180 degrees to find Grace.</p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              He started when he was in the seventh grade, so that would make 
              it nine years.</p>
            <p>PAN CONTINUES back into shadows, then... </p>
            <p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL - DAY</p>
            <p>CAMERA PANS from darkness into a well lit martial arts class room 
              in full session. TIM MULBERRY and expert martial artist is competing 
              against a lesser opponent while their master looks on.</p>
            <p>CAMERA PANS back into shadows, then... </p>
            <p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. COURTROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>CAMERA PANS from darkness and locks on a CLOSEUP of Mickey.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              When you study the martial art, they give out belts that come in 
              different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. 
              Am I correct on that point?</p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              Yes you are.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              What was the color of Tim's belt?</p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of 
              martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?</p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Jeet Kune Do... Now I did some research on that form of fighting, 
              and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce 
              Lee. Did you know that?</p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's 
              fighting style.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of COURT CLERK'S HANDS typing in SLOW MOTION.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have 
              heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee 
              was one of the, it not the greatest fighter in the history of martial 
              arts.</p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              That's what Tim said.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the 
              fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguable the greatest martial artist 
              of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who 
              could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?</p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              Yes, I would.</p>
            <p>Mickey points at Grace with the pencil in his hand.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?</p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              Yes, they were.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Mickey's hand holding the pencil.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. 
              Am I correct on that point?</p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              Yes, you are.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Mallory cracking a slight smile.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Yet, in your testimony just now, you described that Tim... </p>
            <p>CAMERA moves into a tight CLOSEUP of Grace. Her eyes widen.</p>
            <p>MICKEY (O.S.)<br>
              ... kicked me four times in the head.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. GRACE'S HOME - NIGHT</p>

              INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY</p>
            <p>We're back to COLOR 35mm.</p>
            <p>WHITE LEADER FADES to reveal the wall of the holding cell. CAMERA 
              pans onto Mallory on the floor, splashing water on her face from 
              the holding cell toilet. The pain has started to subside.</p>
            <p>All wet, she lies down on the ground and sings:</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              (singing)<br>
              Love is a hurtin' thang, and it leaves a fiery sting.</p>
            <p>SCOTT (V.O.)<br>
              Okay. Okay, we're up again.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (V.O.)<br>
              Roll it. Save the slate.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. SUPPY ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>16mm - BLACK &amp; WHITE</p>
            <p>We're looking through Scott's CAMERA again on a new roll of film.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              You just said an instant of purity was preferable to a lifetime 
              lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies? 
            </p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same 
              species. I used to be you... then I evolved. From where you're standing, 
              you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here... 
              I'm right here... and you... you're somewhere else, man. You say 
              why? I say why not?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Tell me about the purity.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (laughing)<br>
              It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. 
              You're gonna have to do your job.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (laughs)<br>
              Okay... okay... I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              I'm sure we will.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Describe Mallory.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two 
              eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers... </p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe 
              Mallory.<br>
              (points at his head)<br>
              What's up here?<br>
              (points at his heart)<br>
              What's in here?</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              That's indescribable.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that 
              you're never gonna see Mallory again?</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (smiles)<br>
              Says who?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Says the United States of America.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (laughs)<br>
              When have they ever been right?</p>
            <p>The crew laughs off screen.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Hey, just like Soupy Sales.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY</p>
            <p>Scagnetti walks down the hallway leading to the supply room. His 
              face is a patchwork of medical tape, to set his broken nose. Bloody 
              cotton protrudes from each nostril.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>Scagnetti walks into the supply room. Mickey is explaining to Wayne 
              &quot;Why he's killed all those people.&quot; Scagnetti can't believe 
              what he's seeing. The entire room is in rapture.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              ... one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 
              'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into 
              the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to 
              be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              (whispers)<br>
              How's it goin'?</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              (whispers)<br>
              Shhhh! I wanna hear this.</p>
            <p>Wurlitzer sees Scagnetti's bandaged face.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              What the hell happened to you?</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              You should see the other bitch. What time you got?</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Two-thirty. Shhh... </p>
            <p>CAMERA leaves them and travels the room, studying the faces of 
              the deputies, Unruly Julie, Roger , and Wayne as they listen to 
              Mickey's story.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              But I came to the direction I need a gun. Do, the next day I started 
              off early for work, and I'm gonna stop by a gun shop and pick up 
              a little home protection. I walked into the place and had never 
              seen so many guns in all my life. So, I'm lookin' around, the this 
              really nice sales guy comes up to me. His name was Warren. I'll 
              never forget his name. He was really nice. Anyway, Warren showed 
              me all these different models of guns. Magnums, automatics, pistols, 
              Walters. And I ask to see a shotgun. He brings me a Mossberg pump 
              action shotgun. As soon as I held that baby in my hands, I knew 
              what I was gonna do. It felt so good. It felt like it was a part 
              of me. They had a mirror in the store. I looked at myself holding 
              it, and looked so fuckin' good, I immediately bought it. Bought 
              a bunch of boxes of ammo. Turned my car around, drove to Mallory's 
              house, we took care of Mallory's parents, packed up the car, and 
              we were off.</p>
            <p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              SAME SCENE: SHOT THROUGH SCOTT'S CAMERA:</p>
            <p>MEDIUM CLOSEUP on Mickey.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But 
              you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. 
              But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized 
              for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born 
              killer.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Okay, let's cut it.</p>
            <p><br>
              BACK TO: COLOR 35MM</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (to Scott)<br>
              Did ya get that?</p>
            <p>Unruly Julie hands Wayne a notebook. He starts flipping pages.</p>
            <p>SCOTT<br>
              It's gonna be beautiful.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Super cool.<br>
              (to Mickey)<br>
              This is great stuff. How ya doin'?</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              I could go for a Coke.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (yelling)<br>
              Could I get a Coke for Mickey?</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Fine.<br>
              (to Unruly Julie)<br>
              Julie, why don't you make a food run?<br>
              (to the room)<br>
              What's around here?</p>
            <p>DEPUTY SHERIFF<br>
              There's an In and Out Burgers about a block away on Olive. It's 
              walking distance.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Okay, Julie, take everybody's order. I'll have a double double with 
              cheese, french fries, and a large Coke.</p>
            <p>Unruly Julie writes down Wayne's order in her notebook, the goes 
              from person to person collecting their orders.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti and Wurlitzer talk to each other.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Are you all set?</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along.</p>
            <p>In background, Unruly Julie takes Scott's and Roger's orders.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Yeah, we me. They're good men.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. 
              Where are they?</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Waitin' in the lounge.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              How 'bout Mallory?</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.</p>
            <p>Unruly Julie walks up to the two men to take their order. In the 
              BACKGROUND, we hear the wall phone BUZZ.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Me, neither. I don't eat meat.</p>
            <p>Unruly Julie walks away. A deputy yells for Wurlitzer.</p>
            <p>DEPUTY SHERIFF<br>
              Capt'n!</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Yeah?</p>
            <p>The deputy holds the receiver of the wall phone in his hand.</p>
            <p>DEPUTY SHERIFF<br>
              They need you. Emergency!</p>
            <p>Wurlitzer rushes to the phone, grabs the receiver.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Talk to me<br>
              (pause)<br>
              Where?<br>
              (pause)<br>
              For the love of Pete... okay... okay... okay. Mobilize the men. 
              I'm on my way.</p>
            <p>CAMERA PANS away from Wurlitzer to the extremely curious eavesdroppers.</p>
            <p>CAMERA GLIDES by all of them: Scagnetti, Wayne, Scott, Roger, Unruly 
              Julie, and finally ends up on Mickey.</p>
            <p>CAMERA holds on Mickey as he contemplates Wurlitzer's conversation.</p>
            <p>OFF SCREEN the phone receiver being SLAMMED down.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER (O.S.)<br>
              I'll be a son-of-a-bitch. There's a riot going on in the laundry 
              room.</p>
            <p>DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)<br>
              Is it serious?</p>
            <p>WURLITZER (O.S.)<br>
              It sure as hell is. They got guns, hostages, and explosives.</p>
            <p>The room reacts.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER (O.S.)<br>
              Jack, could you stay up here for a while?</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI (O.S.)<br>
              Yeah, sure.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER (O.S.)<br>
              I'm taking one of these men. Yate, come with me.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (O.S.)<br>
              Could we go with you and film it?</p>
            <p>WURLITZER (O.S.)<br>
              Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the 
              hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for 
              you to film there.</p>
            <p>We hear Wurlitzer and Deputy Yates walk out.</p>
            <p>Unruly Julie walks into FRAME next to Mickey. She has her notebook.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              I'll have a four by four. That's four patty burgers. Now they don't 
              have that on the menu, but if you order a four by four, they'll 
              know what you're talking about. A large Coke and two orders of fries.</p>
            <p>When she finishes writing down Mickey's order, Julie walks off 
              silently.</p>
            <p>CAMERA follows Julie out the door and into... </p>
            <p><br>
              INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY</p>
            <p>CAMERA DOLLIES with Julie as she walks down the corridor.</p>
            <p>As DEPUTIES with shotguns and riot gear speed down the hall, the 
              CAMERA passes Julie and speeds down the corridor, following the 
              DEPUTIES into BLACKNESS.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>CAMERA PANS from blackness to WIDE ANGLE of a dark jail wall masques 
              with shadows of prison bars. The surreal echoing sounds of a riot 
              swell until... </p>
            <p>A SHADOW of a PRISON GUARD stumbles into frame, followed by a MOB 
              of other SHADOWS carrying NIGHTSTICKS and BARS.</p>
            <p>The Mob catches the Prison Guard and beat him mercilessly before 
              moving on.</p>
            <p>CAMERA TILTS down to a CLOSEUP of a thin stream of BLOOD crawling 
              across the floor.</p>

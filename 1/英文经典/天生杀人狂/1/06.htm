              EXT. ALLEY - DAY</p>
            <p>In a back alley, the conclusion of &quot;Thrill Killers&quot; plays 
              out. The sound of SIRENS and CHOPPERS are nearing. Movie Mickey, 
              shotgun in hand, runs down the alley stopping at a dumpster, where 
              the wounded and bloody Movie Mallory sits propped up against a brick 
              wall. On the bottom of the SCREEN, the subtitle appears: SCENE FROM 
              &quot;THRILL KILLERS&quot; (1990).</p>
            <p>MOVIE MALLORY<br>
              Mickey, honey, listen to me.</p>
            <p>Movie Mallory holds out her hand for him to take it. He does.</p>
            <p>MOVIE MALLORY<br>
              I can't go. I'm too fucked up.</p>
            <p>MOVIE MICKEY<br>
              I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but -</p>
            <p>MOVIE MALLORY<br>
              I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, 
              but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get our of here.</p>
            <p>MOVIE MICKEY<br>
              No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!</p>
            <p>MOVIE MALLORY<br>
              If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you 
              -</p>
            <p>MOVIE MICKEY<br>
              No fuckin' way!</p>
            <p>MOVIE MALLORY<br>
              Mickey, you're wasting time!</p>
            <p>MOVIE MICKEY<br>
              I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling 
              the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come archin' down this alley any 
              second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And 
              that's that!</p>
            <p>Movie Mallory grabs his hand with both of hers. She's crying.</p>
            <p>The SIREN and CHOPPER sounds are getting closer.</p>
            <p>MOVIE MALLORY<br>
              Mickey, my love, if you leave me, they'll catch me and take me to 
              the hospital. If you stay, you'll make 'em kill you. Then it'd be 
              like I killed you. I could bear anything, but I couldn't bear that. 
              So please, please, for me, my handsome husband, run for your life.</p>
            <p>The SIRENS and CHOPPERS draw closer.</p>
            <p>MOVIE MICKEY<br>
              I can't do it. You're my wife, you're my partner. A fella doesn't 
              run when his partner can't run with him. Mallory, my angel, if I 
              could of left ya, I'd of left ya a long time ago.</p>
            <p>They kiss.</p>
            <p>MOVIE MALLORY<br>
              Well, hell, if you won't leave, give me a gun so I can go out shooting.</p>
            <p>Movie Mickey hands her his .44 Magnum from his belt.</p>
            <p>MOVIE MICKEY<br>
              Sit tight. I'm gonna make it a little tougher for 'em.</p>
            <p>Movie Mickey runs to the end of the alley, peers around the corner 
              at the arriving COPS.<br>
              <br>
              MOVIE MIICKEY<br>
              Time to get naked and boogie.</p>
            <p>Movie Mallory is out of movie Mickey's view. She cocks the .44, 
              then places the barrel under her chin.</p>
            <p>MOVIE MALLORY<br>
              Mickey!</p>
            <p>Movie Mickey's busy. He doesn't turn around.</p>
            <p>MOVIE MICKEY<br>
              Yeah baby.</p>
            <p>MOVIE MALLORY<br>
              You made every day like kindergarten.</p>
            <p>Movie Mallory pulls the trigger. BANG!</p>
            <p>DOLLY down the alley to a CLOSEUP on Mickey as he spins around.</p>
            <p>Movie Mallory literally blew her head clean off. Her headless body, 
              gun in hand, remains upright in her sitting position.</p>
            <p>Movie Mickey runs toward her, screaming her name in SLOW MOTION.</p>
            <p>MOVIE MICKEY<br>
              Mallory!</p>
            <p>CUT BACK TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              THE POPE INTERVIEW</p>
            <p>WAYNE (O.S.)<br>
              Why did you kill Mallory? Both of them are still alive.</p>
            <p>NEIL POPE<br>
              It was dramatic license, no doubt. But I felt an operatic love story 
              needed an operatic ending. The two of them kill for each other. 
              They offer the death of their victims to each other like other lovers 
              offer flowers of bonbons. So what more natural, what more organic, 
              what more poetic than Mallory offering her death to Mickey? It's 
              where it's been leading since day one. We worked it in the movie 
              by using a what if they escaped situation. I think it works beautifully. 
              You'd be surprised. People come up to me at the end of the movie 
              in tears.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY</p>
            <p>Actor JESSIE ALEXANDER WARWICK sits on his motorcycle and talks 
              to the CAMERA. He's dressed in a Levi's jacket, jeans, a bandanna 
              is wrapped around his head, and as he talks he bogarts a smoke. 
              His name appears at the bottom of the SCREEN.</p>
            <p>JESSIE<br>
              One thing about Mickey for sure, he's definitely a man who has his 
              moments. It was wild playin' him. It was one of those get-it-out-of-your-system 
              performances.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. BUFFY ST. MCQUEEN'S HOME - DAY</p>
            <p>This interview is SHOT in Buffy's house ив la Barbara Walters. BUFFY 
              sits on the couch in her living room with a cat in her lap. From 
              time to time, she sips from a coffee cup. Her name appears at the 
              bottom of the SCREEN.</p>
            <p>BUFFY<br>
              I didn't play Mallory, the murderer. I didn't play her as a butcher. 
              I played her as a woman in love, who also happens to murder people. 
              I didn't want her to be at arm's length from the audience or myself. 
              If you play her as this wild maniac, the audience never has to deal 
              with her. If you see a decapitation in a movie, you just say 'Oh 
              wow, a neat special effect.' Because you can't relate to a decapitation. 
              It doesn't mean anything to anybody because it's not personal. Decapitations 
              don't fall into most people's realm of life experiences. But if 
              you show somebody in a movie getting a paper cut, the whole audience 
              squirms. Because everybody can relate to a paper cut.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (O.S.)<br>
              Did you meet the real Mallory Knox?</p>
            <p>BUFFY<br>
              I tried to, but she wouldn't see me. But I read some letters she 
              wrote to Mickey before the murder spree. They helped me out a lot.</p>
            <p><br>

            <p>Jessie talks to CAMERA.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (O.S.)<br>
              You met Mickey Knox, didn't you?</p>
            <p>JESSIE<br>
              Yeah, I visited him when he was up in Susanville. He's a little 
              cerebral for my taste, but all in all, we got along.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. OFFICE - DAY</p>
            <p>Wayne, sitting in a chair in front of a desk, interviews DR. REINGHOLD, 
              who sits behind the desk.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (V.O.)<br>
              To get a psychiatric view on the strange attraction Mickey and Mallory 
              seems to have, we talked with Doctor Emil Reinghold, noted psychologist 
              and author.</p>
            <p>Wayne begins his interview.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Can you shed some light, Doctor Reinghold, on why the public has 
              taken a pair of sociopaths so close to their bosom?</p>
            <p>DR. REINGHOLD<br>
              Well, for one, the media has done a tremendous job of turning the 
              husband and wife mass murderers into celebrities. But it's the country's 
              youth who have turned the couple into the ultimate anti-heroes. 
              Basically, the very thing that makes them most lethal is the exact 
              same thing that captures the public's hearts and minds - Mickey 
              and Mallory's operatic devotion to each other. In a world where 
              people can't seem to make the simplest relationships work and the 
              slightest emotional commitment is considered devastating, Mick and 
              Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a Shakespearean magnitude. To 
              the country's youth, 75 percent of which are coming from broken 
              homes, that's appealing. They have an `us against the world' posture 
              which always appeals to youth. And they've taken that posture seventeen 
              steps beyond. It's not &quot;us against the world,&quot; it's &quot;we're 
              gonna kill the world.&quot; They're exciting. I read their file 
              and I find myself turning the page like it was a paperback. Why 
              do disillusioned youths get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do disillusioned 
              housewives read romance novels? Why are you filming this special? 
              Because you know as well as I do, you say `tonight at nine Charles 
              Manson speaks,' everybody's going to tune in to hear what her says. 
              Mickey and Mallory have shocked a country numb with violence. They've 
              created a world where only two exist and anybody who inadvertently 
              enters that world is murdered.</p>

              Of the six teens murdered that night, seventeen year old Grace Mulberry 
              was the lucky one left to tell the tale. And this haunted young 
              lady summoned up the courage to take the stand, tell what she saw 
              that horrible night, and then allow herself to be cross-examined

            <p><br>
              INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY</p>
            <p>A coffee shop somewhere in New Mexico. MICKEY KNOX, his back turned 
              to us, is sitting at the counter finishing his meal. We hear the 
              PING... BANG... of a pinball machine being played OFF SCREEN.</p>
            <p>MABEL, a waitress, comes over and fills Mickey's coffee cup.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              What kind of pies do you have?</p>
            <p>MABEL<br>
              Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Which do you recommend?</p>
            <p>MABEL<br>
              The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.</p>
            <p>MABEL<br>
              When ya had it, did ya like it?</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person 
              ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass 
              of milk.</p>
            <p>Mabel turns to her right.</p>
            <p>MABEL<br>
              (to someone off screen)<br>
              Should I make that two pieces?</p>
            <p>CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see for the first time MALLORY KNOX, Mickey's 
              wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him. Her back is to the 
              camera as well.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Nada, Rosey.</p>
            <p>MABEL<br>
              (annoyed)<br>
              My name's not Rosey.<br>
              (points at name tag)<br>
              It's Mabel.</p>
            <p>Mabel exits FRAME.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Whatever.</p>
            <p>Mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the JAR next 
              to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter, 
              she selects a quarter.</p>
            <p>MABEL<br>
              Hey, what the hell do you think you're doin'?</p>
            <p>Mallory saunter past the COWBOY playing pinball. As his eyes follow 
              Mallory, he loses his ball.</p>
            <p>She walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter, selects 
              a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record, and a good 
              God almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee shop.</p>
            <p>Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk.</p>
            <p>MABEL<br>
              (to Mickey)<br>
              She ought not be doing that. That's for Jerry's kids, not rock 'n 
              roll.</p>
            <p>CAMERA moves around to a CLOSEUP of Mickey. This is the first time 
              we see him. As he takes a bite of green pie:</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              I can't take her anywhere.</p>
            <p>Mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee 
              shop. She's really cooking and smoking.</p>
            <p>Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the hell 
              these people are.</p>
            <p>Mickey isn't paying much attention. He's too busy enjoying his 
              pie and milk.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY</p>
            <p>A dirty pickup truck, sporting a Confederate flag decal, pulls 
              up to the coffee shop. SONNY, OTIS, and EARL, three tough-looking 
              rednecks, pile out. Steam rises from beneath the pickup's hood.</p>
            <p>EARL<br>
              Goddamn this sumbitch is runnin' hot. Y'all go inside. I'm gonna 
              check 'er out.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY</p>
            <p>The LOUDNESS of the Rockabilly song slaps Sonny and Otis in their 
              faces as they walk inside the door. The sexy sight of Mallory doing 
              the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks.</p>
            <p>SONNY<br>
              Good God almighty. What the hell is that?</p>
            <p>OTIS<br>
              That's a bitch outta hell, son.</p>
            <p>Otis and Sonny exchange looks</p>
            <p>SONNY<br>
              Take a run at 'er, kiddo.</p>
            <p>Otis heads toward Mallory. Sonny moves over to the counter next 
              to Mickey.</p>
            <p>SONNY<br>
              Miller, Mabel.</p>
            <p>MABEL<br>
              Comin' up.</p>
            <p>Otis stands in front of Mallory, trying to copy what she's doing. 
              Her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see him.</p>
            <p>Mabel sets the Miller down in front of Sonny. Sonny takes a swig, 
              enjoying the floor show.</p>
            <p>SONNY<br>
              (to Mickey)<br>
              That's some sweet piece of meat, ain't it?</p>
            <p>Mickey turns from his pie and looks at Sonny. His expression betrays 
              nothing.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Her name's Mallory.</p>
            <p>The needle lifts off the record. The song ends.</p>
            <p>Mallory opens her eyes and sees Otis.</p>
            <p>OTIS<br>
              Hells Bells! Don't stop now sugar. I'm just getting warmed up</p>
            <p>Otis gives her his best shit-eating grin before turning to Sonny.</p>
            <p>Sonny gurgles out a laugh.</p>
            <p>SONNY<br>
              Hey, I think she's sweet on you.</p>
            <p>Otis turns to Mallory as she PUNCHES him hard in the face spinning 
              him around.</p>
            <p>Sonny spews his mouthful of Highlife.</p>
            <p>Mallory grabs the back of Otis' head and SMASHES it down on the 
              table, cracking the linoleum.</p>
            <p>Otis buckles, dropping to his knees.</p>
            <p>Sonny jumps off the counts stool, but Mickey's hand clutches hold 
              of his shoulder.</p>
            <p>Sonny spins around toward Mickey, loaded for bear, and points his 
              finger at him, threateningly.</p>
            <p>Before any threat can be made, Mickey whips a large buck knife 
              out from its sheath, and in a flash, SLICES off Sonny's finger.</p>
            <p>Sonny's finger drops on his boot. He grabs his aching hand. Blood 
              flows from the wound.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Just because my woman's mopping up the floor with your buddy is 
              no reason for you to join in.</p>
            <p>Mickey makes five lightning quick SLASHING SWINGS. The buck knife 
              slips back into its sheath. At first, there seems to be no difference 
              with Sonny. Finally, blood flows from the slices made in his face 
              and chest. Sonny collapses.</p>
            <p>The SHORT-ORDER COOK charges out of the kitchen at Mickey, wielding 
              a meat cleaver and screaming.</p>
            <p>Mickey whips out a .45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside 
              his jacket and FIRES.</p>
            <p><br>
              BULLET'S POV</p>
            <p>Heading fast toward Short-Order Cook's face. It HITS. Short-Order 
              Cook puts his hands to his face and falls to the ground, screaming.</p>
            <p>Mickey spots Earl, who's standing outside the plate glass window. 
              Earl's watched the whole shebang.</p>
            <p>Earl mouths &quot;Fuck!&quot; He turns and runs for it.</p>
            <p>Mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which SHATTERS. 
              The knife PLUNGES deep into Earls back. He hits the ground dead.</p>
            <p>Mickey turns to Mallory. She's sitting on op of Otis, SLAMMING 
              his head repeatedly on the floor.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Honey.</p>
            <p>Mallory looks up at Mickey. She gets off Otis and moves to Mickey's 
              side.</p>
            <p>Mickey trains his .45 on Pinball Cowboy, who's shaking in his cowboy 
              boots. Mickey aims at Mabel, who's clutching he coffee pot, crying.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (to Mallory)<br>
              Pick one.</p>
            <p>Mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth 
              from Mabel to Pinball Cowboy.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a nigger by the tow. If he hollers, 
              let him go. Eanie. meanie. minie, moe. My mom told me to pick the 
              best one and you are it.</p>
            <p>She ends, pointing at Mabel. Mabel's crying. She screams.</p>
            <p>MABEL<br>
              NO!</p>
            <p>Mickey FIRES the .45. The bullet CHINKS through the coffee pot 
              Mabel's holding and explodes, THUNKING her in the chest. She hits 
              the floor dead.</p>
            <p>Mickey and Mallory join hands and walk over to the Pinball Cowboy 
              who stands in a pool of his own urine.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              When you tell people what went on here, tell 'em Mickey and Mallory 
              Knox did this. Understand?</p>
            <p>Pinball Cowboy nods yes.</p>
            <p>The two killers plant a big wet kiss on each other's mouths. Then, 
              holding hands, Mickey and Mallory walk out of the cafe. </p>

              CREDIT SEQUENCE</p>
            <p>INT. COUPE DE VILLE - MOVING - DAY</p>
            <p>Mickey and Mallory in a flashy '68 Cadillac Coupe De Ville. Duane 
              Eddy's &quot;Rebel Rouser&quot; blares on the soundtrack. The background 
              is an outrageous PROCESS SHOT. The titles splash over this image 
              50's style.</p>
            <p>When this sequence is over, we...</p>
            <p>CUT TO BLACK</p>
            <p>END CREDIT SEQUENCE</p>
            <p><br>
              Over black screen, we hear:</p>
            <p>CAPTAIN SQUERI<br>
              Send Scagnetti in here.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. POLICE STATION (SQUERI'S OFFICE) - DAY</p>
            <p>CAMERA is position in the middle of the office. The door is in 
              the middle of the frame.</p>
            <p>JACK SCAGNETTI flings the door open and steps inside Squeri's office. 
              Squeri's never seen.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              You wanted to see me, Capt'n?</p>
            <p>CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)<br>
              Scagnetti, go up to interrogation room C. Dwight McClusky, chairman 
              of the prison board, is waiting to meet you. You're gonna deliver 
              two prisoners from the county jail to Nystrom Insane Asylum in Bakersfield.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              This is bullshit. I'm a detective. You want an errand boy, call 
              Jerry Lewis.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti spins around and leaves the room, SLAMMING the door shut 
              behind him. Captain Squeri shouts after him.</p>
            <p>CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)<br>
              Jack!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - DAY</p>
            <p>Police Detective Scagnetti walks rapidly down the hallway, wearing 
              an old, wrinkly, black suit jacket.</p>
            <p>PEOPLE walk by in the foreground and background Scagnetti slips 
              an already tied tie over his head.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. INTERROGATION ROOM C - DAY</p>
            <p>DWIGHT MCCLUSKY, a man in his fifties, wearing a business suit, 
              stands in the foreground reading a book with his back to the door. 
              In the background, Scagnetti enters the room.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Jack Scagnetti. You wanted to see me?</p>
            <p>McClusky turns toward Scagnetti.</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end 
              to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, 
              and they have you to thank.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Thank you, sir.</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              Dwight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti lowers into a chair in front of the interrogation table.</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              (referring to book)<br>
              This is damn good reading. I'm surprised Hollywood hasn't found 
              you. This would make a better movie than that 'Serpico' shit.</p>
            <p>McClusky puts the book down, we see the title: &quot;CURTIS FOX: 
              The Capture and Death of a Serial Killer&quot; Author Jack Scagnetti. 
              McClusky sits on the edge of the table, facing Scagnetti. He lifts 
              a file off the table, then tosses it in Scagnetti's lap.</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              I think you'll find that good reading as well. Mickey and Mallory's 
              file. You familiar with them?</p>
            <p>Scagnetti opens it. It's the files, reports, and photographs of 
              Mickey and Mallory Knox. Scagnetti's face lights up.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Who isn't?</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              You been followin' the news coverage?</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              They've been separated since their incarnation in a couple of penitentiaries 
              -</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              Susanville, Soledale.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards -</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's 
              time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti nods</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison 
              will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as 
              hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind 
              their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              I can appreciate that.</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              So can we. So the solution to out little problem is we had them 
              deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally 
              insane.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Lobotomy bay?</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              You've heard of it?</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              So, how do I fit into this scheme?</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              The public loves you Jack... You don't mind if I call you Jack, 
              do you?</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              By all means.</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six years on the force, a best-seller 
              out on paperback... </p>
            <p>McClusky grabs Scagnetti's book and reads from the back cover.</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              A modern day Pat Garret. A hell bent lawman with a deadly axe to 
              grind with maniacs.</p>
            <p>McClusky lowers the book.</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen 
              to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that 
              once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape 
              attempt, an accident, fire, anything... Jack &quot;Supercop&quot; 
              Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              I see.</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              You write the script Jack, call it, &quot;Showdown in Mojave: The 
              extermination of Mickey and Mallory&quot;, whatever... Have we found 
              our man?</p>
            <p>Hold on Scagnetti.</p>

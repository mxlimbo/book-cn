              INT. COUNTY JAIL - CELL BLOCK CORRIDOR - DAY</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI'S POV</p>
            <p>McClusky stands next to a big iron door. He BANGS on it with is 
              fist. We stay on Scagnetti's POV through this scene.</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              Pete, open it up! I'm comin' through with a visitor!</p>
            <p>A Buzzer sounds.</p>
            <p>McClusky opens the door and we follow him down the corridor. As 
              soon as the door opens, we can hear a female voice singing the song 
              &quot;Long Time Woman&quot;.</p>
            <p>McClusky turns to Scagnetti as they walk.</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              Well, Jack, I'll tell ya, in all my years with the penal institution, 
              and I'll tell ya that's no small number, Mickey and Mallory Knox 
              are without a doubt the most twisted, depraved group of fucks it's 
              ever been my displeasure to lay my eyes on. I mean, those two rat 
              shits are a walkin' reminder of just how fucked up our system really 
              is.</p>
            <p>The song &quot;Long Time Woman&quot; is getting louder as they 
              proceed.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI (O.S.)<br>
              Who's the song bird?</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned 
              her father in a fish tank.</p>
            <p><br>
              INSERT: INT. A LIVING ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of a home aquarium with fish swimming around. Suddenly 
              Mallory's FATHER'S head is shoved into the tank.</p>

              PRISON CORRIDOR</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              While the two together burned her mother alive in her bed.</p>
            <p><br>
              INSERT: INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p>MEDIUM CLOSEUP of Mallory's MOTHER lying asleep in bed, mouth open. 
              What looks like a gas nozzle appears at the top of the FRAME, pouring 
              gasoline all over her face. She coughs and gags. CAMERA PANS up 
              and we see Mickey holding a gas can.</p>
            <p><br>
              CLOSEUP of Mallory with a lit match by her face. She tosses it in 
              front of her. We hear the SOUNDS of Mallory's mother igniting.</p>
            <p>BACK TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              PRISON CORRIDOR</p>
            <p>STILL SCAGNETTI'S POV:</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI (O.S.)<br>
              Why?</p>
            <p>McClusky's still walking ahead of us.</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI (O.S.)<br>
              Ain't love grand.</p>
            <p>McClusky laughs.</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              Ain't love grand. That's a good one.</p>
            <p>STILL SCAGNETTI'S POV: We look down from McClusky to Mallory's 
              file in our hands. It contains her picture and lists her color of 
              hair, color of eyes, height, weight, race, etc. Beneath that is 
              a column which reads: &quot;PSYCHIATRIC REMARKS&quot;</p>
            <p>As we read the remarks, we hear a DOCTOR'S VOICE read aloud.</p>
            <p>FEMALE PSYCHIATRIST (V.O.)<br>
              When pressed about the reason for the murders... patient became 
              hostile... </p>
            <p><br>
              INSERT: INT. A PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY</p>
            <p>Looking trashy, wild, and animalistic, Mallory's a sex machine 
              dressed in a prison gown. She sits in a chair, looking directly 
              at the CAMERA.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              I don't owe you an explanation! I don't owe you shit! I'm not here 
              for you entertainment. If I don't tell you what you wanna hear, 
              what are you gonna do? Throw me in jail? I'm already there, you 
              stupid pig-fucker. You gonna give me some more time? I've already 
              got life. What else you got to threaten me with? Death? I'd like 
              to see you fuckin' try. I haven't met one motherfucker here who's 
              shown me shit!</p>

              DEATH ROW CORRIDOR:</p>
            <p>STILL ON SCAGNETTI'S POV:</p>
            <p>Wee look up from the fill and see McClusky's leaning against a 
              cell door.</p>
            <p>We hear somebody signing &quot;Long Time Woman&quot; inside the 
              cell.</p>
            <p>We move to McClusky, who looking into the CAMERA, gestures toward 
              the cell.</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              Here she is... you know her, you love her, you can't live without 
              her... Mallory Knox.</p>
            <p>We PAN from McClusky to the inside of the cell where we see Mallory, 
              her back to us, singing and dancing.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. PRISON (MALLORY KNOX'S CELL) - DAY</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Mallory's face singing &quot;Long Time Woman&quot;.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              (singing)<br>
              99 years is a long, long time. Look at me, I will never be free, 
              I'm a long time woman...</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY (O.S.)<br>
              Hey, Knox! Somebody out here wants to meet you.</p>
            <p>Mallory just keeps on truckin'.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              (singing)<br>
              Been workin' on the road now.<br>
              Been workin' by the sea.<br>
              Been workin' in the cane fields.<br>
              and I wanna be free...</p>
            <p><br>
              MALLORY'S POV</p>
            <p>We stare a McClusky and Scagnetti for a second. Then, like a bull, 
              we CHARGE/DOLLY straight at them. Mallory screams off screen. We 
              SMASH headfirst into the bars. Mallory's POV flings up, looking 
              at the ceiling, then falls backward.</p>
            <p><br>
              MEDIUM TIGHT SHOT OF FLOOR</p>
            <p>Mallory falls into FRAME, out cold.</p>

            <p>CAMERA PANS over to CLOSEUP on McClusky.</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              Don't worry about it. She does that all the time.</p>
            <p>BACK TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              MALLORY ON THE FLOOR</p>
            <p>Still unconscious with blood trickling down her scalp.</p>

              Follow me.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. PRISON (LONG CORRIDOR) - DAY</p>
            <p>CAMERA is at the end of a long corridor. McClusky and Scagnetti 
              approach from the other end. Scagnetti's studying the files.</p>
            <p>PHIL WURLITZER comes up behind the two men.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              You duckin' me Dwight?</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              Hey, Phil, how the hell are ya?</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              (to Scagnetti)<br>
              This son-of-a-bitch is chairman of the prison board, but it's like 
              pullin' teeth to get him down to a prison.</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              The only reason I'm here now is to set him straight, and I'm on 
              the next flight out.<br>
              (to Scagnetti)<br>
              Jack, this is the superintendent of the jail. Phil Wurlitzer. He's 
              the man who's got the power of the pen here.</p>
            <p>Wurlitzer shakes hands with Scagnetti.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good 
              work on Curtis Fox.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Thanks.</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              From now on, you'll be dealin' with Phil. He can answer all the 
              questions you got about the arrangements. I'm gonna be bidding you 
              good luck and adieu in about twenty minutes. My flight back to Sacramento 
              leaves LAX in a hour.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              And I want you to know, we'll all cry a river when you're gone.</p>
            <p>They all laugh.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              What's the travelling arrangements?</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on 
              one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll 
              come back for Mickey.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              And where do you keep Mickey?</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole 
              place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special 
              visitor.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Who?</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Wayne Gayle.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              (surprised)<br>
              Wayne Gayle!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. JAIL - VISITING AREA - DAY</p>
            <p>WAYNE GAYLE, a young, energetic, commando journalist ив la Geraldo 
              Rivera is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail visiting 
              area. Wayne is alone and the visiting area is empty. Apparently 
              some arrangement was made for the visit. Wayne has a miniature tape 
              recorder in his hand and is testing it.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (into recorder)<br>
              Testing one... two... three... testing... one... three... over, 
              over, over, Mickey Knox meeting.</p>
            <p>Wayne shuts off the recorder, rewinds and plays it back. It works 
              beautifully. He hits the record button and conceals the recorder 
              in his sport coat jacket.</p>
            <p>The door opens on the prisoner side and Mickey Knox is lead into 
              the room by two SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Mickey's wearing the country 
              jail blue jump-suit. He has a thick and wide leather belt around 
              his waist with a metal ring built into each side. Long sturdy chains 
              with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body and through 
              the rings, binding his arms to his sides. His hands and feet are 
              double cuffed.</p>
            <p>The Deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in 
              half at the slightest provocation. For a man wrapped and bound in 
              chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment. Even 
              restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains, jail, 
              guards, guns, jump-suit), he remains a dangerous, intimidating, 
              and fascinating figure.</p>
            <p>Wayne takes in the image of Mickey.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (to himself)<br>
              Showtime.</p>
            <p>Mickey's roughly shoved into his seat on the prisoner's side of 
              the glass. The Deputies move to their place, off to the side by 
              the wall</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. 
              I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one 
              of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial -</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.</p>
            <p>Wayne pauses and retorts.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              I could say the same thing about you.<br>
              (smiles)<br>
              I want to thank you very much for seeing me... </p>
            <p>Mickey is silent.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              I have a television show. It's very popular. Every week we do a 
              profile on a different serial killer. You don't mind if I call you 
              a serial killer, do you?</p>
            <p>Mickey shakes his head no.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular 
              ones</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Whose ratings were higher?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Yours.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Good... yuppie piece of shit.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              What I'd like to do -</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              How 'bout Manson?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Manson beat you.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. 
              And that time has definitely come.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that 
              the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' 
              window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You 
              belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly 
              railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning 
              you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am 
              not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this 
              to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see 
              fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions 
              are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel 
              what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?</p>
            <p>No response from Mickey</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm 
              all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board 
              is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews 
              with chairman of the prison board Dwight McClusky about this issue. 
              And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists 
              they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, 
              which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge 
              of your trail, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil 
              Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. 
              You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. 
              But the network isn't satisfied. They fell the show needs another 
              element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need 
              to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since 
              your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, 
              you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' 
              a media event here. Every son-of-a-bitch out the with a TV set's 
              gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, 
              we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little 
              while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory 
              lobotomies.<br>
              Well, whatta ya say?</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Have you talked to Mallory about this?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything 
              about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. 
              Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word. 
            </p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              She doesn't talk?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Not to anybody. She sings.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              She sings? What does she sing?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', 
              that Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's 
              what I hear anyway. Her behavior was the main thing the doctors' 
              report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she 
              won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, 
              are you insane?' And she starts singing 'Dead Skunk In The Middle 
              Of The Road', that blows out whole case.</p>
            <p>Mickey cracks a smile.</p>
            <p>The guards come over to take him away.</p>
            <p>DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)<br>
              Time, motherfucker!</p>
            <p>They grab Mickey, and jerk him from the chair. Wayne stands.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Wait a minute, Mickey, I need an answer.</p>
            <p>Mickey doesn't respond. He just leaves with the guards.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (yells after him)<br>
              Just think about it. But don't think too long.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY</p>
            <p>MEDIUM CLOSEUP of Mickey curled up by his bed, writing Mallory 
              a letter.</p>
            <p>MICKEY (V.O.)<br>
              Dearest Mallory. My cell is so cold. At night I get the chills. 
              I pretend you're lying next to me, holding me from behind with your 
              leg draped over mine and your arms wrapped tightly around me. I 
              lie in my cell... </p>

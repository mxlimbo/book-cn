            <p>Dewight McClusky.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (V.O.)<br>
              We talked with Dewight McClusky, chairman of the California State 
              Prison Board, about this curious turn of events in the Mickey and 
              Mallory case.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MCCLUSKY'S OFFICE - DAY</p>
            <p>Wayne's interviewing McClusky.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made 
              the decision?</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're 
              the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill 
              and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive 
              the help they need.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination 
              before their trial. I'm confused, What's changed?</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. 
              And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along 
              with several guards and inmates.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty 
              people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which 
              frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this 
              situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, 
              Mr. McClusky, what's changed?</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent 
              a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under 
              close observation, day in and day out, and their behavior has led 
              us to believe we were wrong.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Who is we?</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              The prison board and the doctors who examined them.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Were and of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs 
              mental state asked to re-examine them?</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              Using the same doctors is not common practice.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?</p>
            <p>MCCLUSKY<br>
              Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't 
              really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions 
              are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you 
              think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist 
              that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The 
              state doesn't work like that.</p>

            <p>WAYNE (V.O.)<br>
              ... and Dr. Felix Vargus. Both of the good doctors, for whatever 
              reason, refused to be interviewed.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. DR. REINGHOLD'S OFFICE - DAY</p>
            <p>Back with Dr. Reinghold. He's laughing.</p>
            <p>DR. REINGHOLD<br>
              It's a funny situation actually. If anyone besides Mickey and Mallory 
              give a damn, what the prison board is doing would be considered 
              an outrage. The prison board is basically saying, `We can't handle 
              these guys.' They've moved 'em around twice since their sentence 
              started. They were a handful everywhere they went. Now the prisons 
              they're at now want them outta there. But no other prison's gonna 
              be stupid enough to take 'em. So the prison board is left scratching 
              their heads wondering what they're gonna do. Well, what they decided 
              to do was to set up a kangaroo medical court that found them crazy. 
              Then they get them transferred to Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy 
              Bay as its' referred to in the psychiatric circle. Put 'em on a 
              strict dope and electro shock diet, and Mickey and Mallory cease 
              to be a problem to anybody except the orderlies who clean out the 
              bedpans, which if you want to see them get theirs, that's all well 
              and good. But there's something being said here. Forget the immorality 
              for a second. Forget the corruption and the skulduggery involved. 
              What the board is saying is &quot;we give up.&quot; Mickey and Mallory 
              ran amuck in polite society. They were put in an alternative society 
              and they ran amuck there, too. All the powers that be, can't deal 
              with these two kids. And whatever can't be assimilated has to be 
              terminated.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory are not insane?</p>
            <p>DR. REINGHOLD<br>
              Insane... no. Psychotic, yes. A menace to living creatures, yes. 
              But to suggest that they're insane gives the impression that they 
              don't know right from wrong. Mickey and Mallory know the difference 
              between right and wrong. They just don't give a damn.</p>
            <p>FREEZE FRAME on Dr. Reinghold.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. EDITING BAY - DAY</p>
            <p>Wayne's just finished viewing the show. He puts his hands on Scott 
              and Roger's shoulders.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'-tastic! I think that interview 
              stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep 
              the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep 
              them movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. 
              And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. 
              Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new 
              team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking 
              about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold 
              laughing.</p>
            <p>SCOTT<br>
              Okay.</p>
            <p>Wayne puts his arm around Unruly Julie.</p>

              There's this Italian guy, a French guy, and a Polish guy. And they're

              INT. NEWS VAN - MOVING - DAY</p>
            <p>Through Scott's CAMERA, we're filming this in BLACK AND WHITE - 
              16mm.</p>
            <p>NOTE: Everytime we're viewing through Scott's CAMERA, we are filming 
              handheld in 16mm BLACK AND WHITE. Until otherwise specified, the 
              SHOTS stay in Scott's CAMERA.</p>
            <p>Scott's filming the back of the newsvan. Roger's sitting in the 
              back eating donuts as is Wayne. Unruly Julie's up front driving.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (with mouthful of donut)<br>
              How's it working, Scotty?</p>
            <p>SCOTT (O.S.)<br>
              Perfecto!</p>
            <p>Roger's picking through a box of donuts. Scott PANS over to him, 
              then slowly ZOOMS in on him.</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              Where the fuck's the chocolate cream filled? Did anyone get my chocolate 
              cream filled? If you did, it's mine.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Roger, looking into CAMERA.</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              I pointed at a chocolate cream filled. You saw me do it, didn't 
              you?</p>
            <p>Wayne starts talking. We PAN from Roger to a CLOSEUP of Wayne.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              You were there. Did you see him put it in a box?</p>
            <p>WE PAN back to a CLOSEUP of Roger.</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              At the time, I was too busy explaining to Scott the finer points 
              of film.</p>
            <p>WE ZOOM back to a WIDE SHOT.</p>
            <p>SCOTT (O.S.)<br>
              Yeah, right. You know what he said? He said, &quot;Indiana Jones 
              and the Temple of Doom&quot; is Spielberg's best film.</p>
            <p>Wayne starts laughing. We hear Scott laugh too.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (to Roger)<br>
              You can't be serious?</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              (preoccupied)<br>
              I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut 
              store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for 
              forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by 
              mistake.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Roger, no.</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one 
              of these roasted coconut -</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important 
              we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can 
              mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies 
              included, my chocolate cream filled?</p>
            <p>Unruly Julie HONKS the horn. Wayne gets up and looks out the windshield.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the 
              front.</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              Wayne -</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut 
              shit, and gather your gear.</p>
            <p>The van stops. Wayne slides open the panel door, and steps out.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - DAY</p>
            <p>BACK TO: COLOR 35MM.</p>
            <p>Wayne hops out of the van and is approached by Superintendent Phil 
              Wurlitzer who's followed by two DEPUTY SHERIFFS.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (aside to Scott)<br>
              Here's the welcome wagon.</p>
            <p>Wurlitzer reaches them and shakes Wayne's hand.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's 
              a pleasure to meet you.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott... Roger... and Unruly 
              Julie... this is... I'm sorry. What's your title again?</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies 
              are who you'll be working with while you're<br>
              here.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              That sounds great. Look, I don't want and of this to intimidate 
              you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very 
              easy.<br>
              (to his crew)<br>
              I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, 
              power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. 
              Julie come with me.</p>
            <p>Julie tosses the keys to Roger and shadows Wayne as he speaks confidentially 
              to Wurlitzer.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              The main thing I need is a big room, shut off from the population, 
              so we can get some privacy... with a few electrical outlets.</p>

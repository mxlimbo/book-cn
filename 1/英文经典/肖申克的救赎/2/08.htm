                89 INT -- MAIN BUILDING -- STORAGE ROOMS -- DAY (1949) 89</p>
              <p>A series of bleak rooms stacked high with unused filing<br>
                cabinets, desks, paint supplies, etc. Andy enters. He hears a<br>
                FLUTTER OF WINGS. An adult crow lands on a filing cabinet and<br>
                struts back and forth, checking him out. Andy smiles.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?</p>
              <p>Brooks Hatlen pokes his head out of the back room.</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                Andy! Thought I heard you out here!</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I've been reassigned to you.</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                I know, they told me. Ain't that a kick in the ass? Come on in, 
                I'll give you the dime tour.</p>
              <p>90 INT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1949) 90</p>
              <p>Brooks leads Andy into the bleakest back room of all. Rough plank 
                shelves are lined with books. Brooks' private domain.</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                Here she is, the Shawshank Prison Library. Along this side, we 
                got the National Geographics. That side, the Reader's Digest Condensed 
                books. Bottom shelf there, some Louis L'Amours and Erle Stanley 
                Gardners. Every night I pile the cart and make my rounds. I write 
                down the names on this clipboard here. Well, that's it. Easy, 
                peasy, Japanesey. Any questions?</p>
              <p>Andy pauses. Something about this doesn't make any sense.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Brooks? How long have you been librarian?</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                Since 1912. Yuh, over 37 years.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                In all that time, have you ever had an assistant?</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                Never needed one. Not much to it, is there?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                So why now? Why me?</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                I dunno. Be nice to have some comp'ny down here for a change.</p>
              <p>HADLEY (O.S.)<br>
                Dufresne!</p>
              <p>91 Andy steps back into the outer rooms and finds Hadley with 
                91<br>
                another GUARD, a huge fellow named DEKINS.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                That's him. That's the one.</p>
              <p>Hadley exits. Dekins approaches Andy ominously. Andy stands his 
                ground, waiting for whatever comes next. Finally:</p>
              <p>DEKINS<br>
                I'm Dekins. I been, uh, thinkin' 'bout maybe settin' up some kinda 
                trust fund for my kids' educations.</p>
              <p>Andy covers his surprise. Glances at Brooks. Brooks smiles.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I see. Well. Why don't we have a seat and talk it over?</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                Pull down one'a them desks there.</p>
              <p>Andy and Dekins grab a desk standing on end and tilt it to the 
                floor. They find chairs and settle in. Brooks returns with a tablet 
                of paper and a pen, slides them before Andy.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                What did you have in mind? A weekly draw on your pay?</p>
              <p>DEKINS<br>
                Yuh. I figured just stick it in the bank, but Captain Hadley said 
                check with you first.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                He was right. You don't want your money in a bank.</p>
              <p>DEKINS<br>
                I don't?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                What's that gonna earn you? Two and a half, three percent a year? 
                We<br>
                can do a lot better than that.<br>
                (wets his pen)<br>
                So tell me, Mr. Dekins. Where do you want to send your kids?<br>
                Harvard? Yale?</p>
              <p>92 INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1949) 92</p>
              <p>FLOYD<br>
                He didn't say that!</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                God is my witness. And Dekins, he just blinks for a second, then 
                laughs his ass off. Afterward, he actually shook Andy's hand.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                My ass!</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                Shook his fuckin' hand. Just about shit myself. All Andy needed 
                was a<br>
                suit and tie, a jiggly little hula girl on his desk, he would'a 
                been Mister Dufresne, if you please.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Makin' yourself some friends, Andy.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I wouldn't say &quot;friends.&quot; I'm a convicted murderer who 
                provides sound financial planning. That's a wonderful pet to have.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Got you out of the laundry, didn't it?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Maybe it can do more than that.<br>
                (off their looks)<br>
                How about expanding the library? Get some new books in there.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                How you 'spect to do that, &quot;Mr. Dufresne-if-you-please?&quot;</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Ask the warden for funds.</p>
              <p>LAUGHTER all around. Andy blinks at them.</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                Son, I've had six wardens through here during my tenure, and I 
                have<br>
                learned one great immutable truth of the universe: ain't one of 
                'em been born whose asshole don't pucker up tight as a snare drum 
                when you ask for funds.</p>
              <p>93 INT -- MAIN BUILDING HALLWAY -- DAY (1949) 93</p>
              <p>DOLLYING Norton and Andy up the hall:</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Not a dime. My budget's stretched thin as it is.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I see. Perhaps I could write to the State Senate and request funds 
                directly from them.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Far as them Republican boys in Augusta are concerned, there's 
                only<br>
                three ways to spend the taxpayer's hard-earned when it come to 
                prisons.<br>
                More walls. More bars. More guards.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Still, I'd like to try, with your permission. I'll send a letter 
                a week. They can't ignore me forever.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                They sure can, but you write your letters if it makes you happy. 
                I'll even mail 'em for you, how's that?</p>
              <p>94 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 94</p>
              <p>Andy is on his bunk, writing a letter.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                So Andy started writing a letter a week, just like he said.</p>
              <p>95 INT -- GUARD DESK/NORTON'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1949) 95</p>
              <p>Andy pops his head in. The GUARD shakes his head.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                And just like Norton said, Andy got no answers. But still he kept 
                on.</p>
              <p>96 INT -- PRISON LIBRARY/ANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY (1950) 96</p>
              <p>Andy is doing taxes. Mert Entwhistle is seated across from him. 
                Other off-duty guards are waiting their turn.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                The following April, Andy did tax returns for half the guards 
                at<br>
                Shawshank.</p>
              <p>97 INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- ONE YEAR LATER (1951) 97</p>
              <p>Tax time again. Even more guards are waiting.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Year after that, he did them all... including the warden's.</p>
              <p>98 EXT -- BASEBALL DIAMOND -- DAY (1952) 98</p>
              <p>A BATTER in a &quot;Noresby Marauders&quot; baseball uniform 
                WHACKS the<br>
                ball high into left field and races for first.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Year after that, they rescheduled the start of the intramural 
                season to coincide with tax season...</p>
              <p>99 INT -- PRISON LIBRARY/ANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY (1952) 99</p>
              <p>The Batter sits across from Andy. The line winds out the door.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their 
                W-2's.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Moresby Prison issued you that gun, but you actually had to pay 
                for it?</p>
              <p>THE BATTER<br>
                Damn right, and the holster too.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                See, that's all deductible. You get to write that off.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Yes sir, Andy was a regular H&amp;R Block. In fact, he got so 
                busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff.</p>
              <p>ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal Red and Brooks doing filing chores.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Say Red, could you hand me a stack of those 1040s?</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that 
                was fine<br>
                by me.</p>
              <p>100 INT -- GUARD DESK/NORTON'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1953) 100</p>
              <p>Andy enters and drops a letter on the outgoing stack.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                And still he kept sending those letters...</p>
              <p>101 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1953) 101</p>
              <p>Dark. Andy's in his bunk, polishing a four-inch length of quartz. 
                It's a beautifully-crafted chess piece in the shape of a horse's 
                head, poise and nobility captured in gleaming stone.</p>
              <p>He puts the knight on a chess board by his bed, adding it to 
                four pieces already there: a king, a queen, and two bishops. He 
                turns to Rita. Moonlight casts bars across her face.</p>
              <p>102 EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1954) 102</p>
              <p>Floyd runs into the yard, scared and winded. He finds Andy and 
                Red on the bleachers.</p>
              <p>FLOYD<br>
                Red? Andy? It's Brooks.</p>
              <p>103 INT -- PRISON LIBRARY/ANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY (1954) 103</p>
              <p>Floyd rushes in with Andy and Red at his heels. They find Jigger 
                and Snooze trying to calm Brooks, who has Heywood in a chokehold 
                and a knife to his throat. Heywood is terrified.</p>
              <p>JIGGER<br>
                C'mon, Brooksie, why don't you just calm the fuck down, okay?</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                Goddamn miserable puke-eatin' sons of whores!</p>
              <p>He kicks a table over. Tax files explode through the air.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                What the hell's going on?</p>
              <p>SNOOZE<br>
                You tell me, man. One second he was fine, then out came the knife. 
                I<br>
                better get the guards.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                No. We'll handle this. Ain't that right, Brooks? Just settle down 
                and we'll talk about it, okay?</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                Nothing left to talk about! It's all talked out! Nothing left 
                now but to cut his fuckin' throat!</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Why? What's Heywood done to you?</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                That's what they want! It's the price I gotta pay!</p>
              <p>Andy steps forward, rivets Brooks with a gaze. Softly:</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Brooks, you're not going to hurt Heywood, we all know that. Even 
                Heywood knows it, right Heywood?</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                (nods, terrified) Sure. I know that. Sure.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Why? Ask anyone, they'll tell you. Brooks Hatlen is a reasonable 
                man.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                (cuing nods all around)<br>
                Yeah, that's right. That's what everybody says.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                You're not fooling anybody, so just put the damn knife down and 
                stop<br>
                scaring the shit out of people.</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                But it's the only way they'll let me stay.</p>
              <p>Brooks bursts into tears. The storm is over. Heywood staggers 
                free, gasping for air. Andy takes the knife, passes it to Red. 
                Brooks dissolves into Andy's arms with great heaving sobs.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Take it easy. You'll be all right.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Him? What about me? Crazy old fool! Goddamn near slit my throat!</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                You've had worse from shaving. What'd you do to set him off?</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Nothin'! Just came in to say fare-thee-well.<br>
                (off their looks)<br>
                Ain't you heard? His parole came through!</p>
              <p>Red and Andy exchange a surprised look. Andy wants to understand. 
                Red just motions to let it be for now. He puts his arm around 
                Brooks, who sobs inconsolably. Softly:</p>
              <p>RED</p>
              <p>Ain't that bad, old hoss. Won't be long till you're squiring 
                pretty young girls on your arm and telling 'em lies.</p>
              <p>104 EXT -- PRISON YARD BLEACHERS -- DUSK (1954) 104</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I just don't understand what happened in there, that's all.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse, is what.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Heywood, enough. Ain't nothing wrong with Brooksie. He's just<br>
                institutionalized, that's all.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Institutionalized, my ass.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Man's been here fifty years. This place is all he knows. In here, 
                he's an important man, an educated man. A librarian. Out there, 
                he's nothing but a used-up old con with arthritis in both hands. 
                Couldn't even get a library card if he applied. You see what I'm 
                saying?</p>
              <p>FLOYD<br>
                Red, I do believe you're talking out of your ass.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Believe what you want. These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, 
                then<br>
                you get used to 'em. After long enough, you get so you depend 
                on 'em. That's &quot;institutionalized.&quot;</p>
              <p>JIGGER<br>
                Shit. I could never get that way.</p>
              <p>ERNIE<br>
                (softly)<br>
                Say that when you been inside as long as Brooks has.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Goddamn right. They send you here for life, and that's just what 
                they<br>
                take. Part that counts, anyway.</p>

              <p>235 EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1953) 235</p>
              <p>Andy strolls along, whistling softly, hands in both pockets. 
                TILT DOWN to his pantleg. Concrete grit trickles out.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                It turns out Andy's favorite hobby was totin' his wall out into 
                the<br>
                exercise yard a handful at a time...</p>
              <p>236 INT -- 2ND TIER -- NIGHT (1962) 236</p>
              <p>A GUARD strolls the tier, shining his flashlight into the cells. 
                He pauses at Andy's bars, playing the beam over the sleeping form 
                huddled under the blankets.</p>
              <p>p37 REVERSE ANGLE (FROM INS1DE ANDY'S CELL) 237</p>
              <p>We see what the guard doesn't: instead of Andy's head under the 
                blanket, it's a wadded-up pillow. The flashlight plays across 
                the cell, pinning Marilyn Monroe in a circle of light.</p>
              <p>238 ANGLE FROM BEHIND POSTER 238</p>
              <p>The light illuminates her face through the paper. WIDEN to reveal 
                Andy lying in his tunnel, holding his breath. The light clicks 
                off. The FOOTSTEPS move on. He gets back to work.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                While the rest of us slept, Andy spent years workin' the nightshift...</p>
              <p>239 INT -- SHAFT -- NIGHT (1965) 239</p>
              <p>BOOMING SLOWLY UP the shaft. Rats scurry the pipes. Suddenly, 
                a piece of concrete the size of a quarter jumps free and plummets 
                down the shaft as the rock-hammer pushes through. The pick withdraws, 
                replaced by Andy's peering eye.</p>
              <p>240 A SERIES OF DISSOLVES (1965 through 1966) 240</p>
              <p>takes us through the widening of the hole. First as big as a 
                tea cup. Then a saucer. Then a dinner plate.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Probably took him most of a year just to get his head through.</p>
              <p>Andy finally gets his head through, scraping his ears. He's got 
                a penlight clenched in his teeth. He peers down into the shaft. 
                At the very bottom, maybe 20 feet down, a big ceramic pipe runs 
                the length of the cellblock. Beneath its coat of grime and dust, 
                the word &quot;SEWER&quot; is stenciled.</p>
              <p>241 EXT -- LOADING DOCK ACCESS -- NIGHT (1966) 241</p>
              <p>ANGLE LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN. Below us, Tommy Williams lies facedown 
                at Norton's feet. Blood is spreading, fanning out of the pavement. 
                Norton turns, strolls out of frame.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                I guess after Tommy was killed, Andy decided he'd been here just<br>
                about long enough.</p>
              <p>Again we see: Andy working. Norton pokes his head in.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Lickety-split. I wanna get home.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Just about done, sir.</p>
              <p>Norton crosses to the wall safe and works the dial, his back 
                turned. This time, though, we stay on Andy:</p>
              <p>He pulls up his sweater, yanks out a large black book and a stack 
                of files, lays them on the desk. He then grabs the real ledger 
                and files, jams them down his pants and smoothes his sweater down. 
                He picks up the bogus stack, crosses to Norton, and shoves everything 
                in.</p>
              <p>243 INT -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT (1966) 243</p>
              <p>Norton exits his office and strolls off whistling. PUSH IN on 
                the open door. We see Andy at the guard's desk, pulling Norton's 
                dress shoes from their box.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Andy did like he was told. Buffed those shoes to a high mirror 
                shine.</p>
              <p>244 INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- MINUTES LATER (1966) 244</p>
              <p>Andy sorts through Norton's three suits. He pauses, checking 
                the gray pinstripe. Nice.</p>
              <p>245 INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1966) 245</p>
              <p>The guard BUZZES Andy through. Andy walks toward us.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                The guard simply didn't notice. Neither did I. I mean, seriously, 
                how often do you really look at a man's shoes?</p>
              <p>TILT DOWN as he passes by. Yep, he's wearing Norton's shoes.</p>
              <p>246 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 246</p>
              <p>The lights go out. Andy places the last chess piece. Gazes up 
                at Racquel. Smiles. Pulls the rope from under his pillow. He stands 
                and unbuttons his prison shirt, revealing Norton's gray pinstripe 
                suit underneath. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the cell, throwing 
                wild shadows.</p>
              <p>247 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 247</p>
              <p>The storm rages. Andy, naked, carefully slips Norton's folded 
                suit into a large industrial Zip-Lock bag. Next to go in are the 
                shoes, chess pieces (already in a smaller bag), black ledger en 
                files. Last but not least, a bar of soap wrapped in a towel.</p>
              <p>248 INT -- TUNNEL -- NIGHT (1966) 248</p>
              <p>Andy, again wearing prison clothes, inches down the tunnel.</p>
              <p>249 INT -- SHAFT -- NIGHT (1966) 249</p>
              <p>Andy squeezes through the hole head-first, emerges to the waist, 
                He reaches for the opposite wall, manages to snag a steel conduit 
                with his fingers.</p>
              <p>Suddenly, a huge rat darts for his hand. Andy yanks away and 
                almost plummets head-first down the shaft. He dangles wildly upside-down 
                for a moment, arms windmilling, then gets his hands pressed firmly 
                against the opposite wall. The rat scurries off, pissed.</p>
              <p>Andy snags the conduit again. He contorts out of the hole and 
                dangles into the shaft. We now see the purpose for the rope: the 
                plastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack,</p>
              <p>He kicks his legs across the shaft, gets his feet braced. Wit3 
                his back against one wall and feet against the other, he starts 
                down the shaft. Sliding dangerously. Using pipes for handholds. 
                Flinching as rats dart this way and that, scurrying in the shadows. 
                He drops the last few feet to the bottom.</p>
              <p>He approaches the ceramic sewer pipe and kneels before it. Pulls 
                out the rock-hammer and says a quick silent prayer. Raises the 
                rock-hammer high and swings it down with all his might. Once, 
                twice -- third time lucky. An enormous eruption of sewage cascades 
                into the air as if rocket-propelled, the Mount St. Helens of shit. 
                Andy is instantly coated black. He turns away and heaves his guts 
                out. The shit keeps coming.</p>
              <p>250 INT -- SEWER PIPE -- NIGHT (1966) 250</p>
              <p>Andy peers down through the hole, playing his penlight aroun5, 
                The inside diameter is no more than two feet. Tight squeeze. Coated 
                with crud. It seems to go on for miles.</p>
              <p>No turning back. He wriggles into the pipe and starts crawling, 
                plastic bag dragging behind.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Andy crawled to freedom through five hundred yards of shit-smelling<br>
                foulness I can't even imagine. Or maybe I just don't want to.</p>
              <p>251 EXT -- FIELD -- NIGHT (1966) 251</p>
              <p>Rain is falling in solid sheets. Shawshank is half a mile distant. 
                BOOM DOWN to reveal the creek...and PUSH IN toward the mouth of 
                the sewer pipe that feeds into it.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Five hundred yards. The length of five football fields. Just shy 
                of half a mile.</p>
              <p>Fingers appear, thrusting through the heavy-gauge wire mesh covering 
                the mouth of the pipe. Andy's face looms from the darkness, peering 
                out at freedom. He wrenches the mesh loose, pushes himself out, 
                and plunges head-first into the creek. He comes up sputtering 
                for breath. The water is waist-deep.</p>
              <p>He wades upstream, ripping his clothes from his body. He gets 
                his shirt off, spins it through the air over his head, flings 
                the shirt away. He raises his arms to the sky, turning slowly, 
                feeling the rain washing him clean. Exultant. Triumphant. A FLASH 
                OF LIGHTNING arcs from horizon to horizon.</p>
              <p>252 INT -- ANDY'S TUNNEL -- DAY (1966) 252</p>
              <p>Once again, we see stunned faces as CAMERA PULLS BACK.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                The next morning, right about the time Racquel was spilling her<br>
                little secret...</p>
              <p>253 INT -- CASCO BANK OF PORTLAND -- MORNING (1966) 253</p>
              <p>The door opens. Spit-shined shoes enter. DOLLY the shoes to the 
                counter.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                ...a man nobody ever laid eyes on before strolled into the Casco 
                Bank<br>
                of Portland. Until that moment, he didn't exist -- except on paper.</p>
              <p>FEMALE TELLER (O.S.)<br>
                May I help you?</p>
              <p>TILT UP to Andy. Smiling in Norton's gray pinstripe suit.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                My name is Peter Stevens. I've come to close out some accounts.</p>
              <p>254 INT -- BANK -- SHORTLY LATER (1966) 254</p>
              <p>The teller is cutting a cashier's check while the MANAGER carefully 
                examines Mr. Stevens' various I.D.s.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                He had all the proper I.D. Driver's license, birth certificate, 
                social<br>
                security card. The signature was a spot-on match.</p>
              <p>MANAGER</p>
              <p>I must say I'm sorry to be losing your business. I hope you'll 
                enjoy<br>
                living abroad.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Thank you. I'm sure I will.</p>
              <p>TELLER<br>
                Here's your cashier's check, sir. Will there be anything else?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Please. Would you add this to your outgoing mail?</p>
              <p>He hands her a package, stamped and addressed. Gives them a<br>
                pleasant smile. Turns and strolls from the bank.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area 
                that<br>
                morning. All told, he blew town with better than 370 thousand 
                dollars of Warden Norton's money. Severance pay for nineteen years.</p>
              <p>255 INT -- OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 255</p>
              <p>A MAN in shirtsleeves is going through the mail on his desk. 
                He finds Andy's package, rips it open. Pulls out the black ledger 
                and files. Scans a cover letter. Holy shit. He dashes to his door 
                and yanks it open, revealing the words on the glass: &quot;PORTLAND 
                DAILY BUGLE -- Editor In Chief.&quot;</p>
              <p>MAN<br>
                Hal! Dave! Get your butts in here!</p>
              <p>256 INT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DAY (1966) 256</p>
              <p>Norton walks slowly toward his office. Dazed. The morning paper 
                in his hand. He goes wordlessly past the DUTY GUARD into his office. 
                Shuts the door. Lays the paper on his desk.</p>
              <p>The headline reads: &quot;CORRUPTION AND MURDER AT SHAWSHANK.&quot;<br>
                Below that, the sub-headline: &quot;D.A. Has Ledger. Indictments<br>
                Expected.&quot; Norton looks up as SIRENS SWELL in the distance.</p>
              <p>257 EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- WIDE SHOT -- DAY (1966) 257</p>
              <p>For the second time, State Police cruisers go rocketing up the 
                road with SIRENS AND LIGHTS.</p>
              <p>258 INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 258</p>
              <p>Norton opens his safe and pulls out the &quot;ledger&quot; -- 
                it's Andy's Bible. The title page is inscribed by hand: &quot;Dear 
                Warden. You were right. Salvation lay within.&quot; Norton flips 
                to the center of the book -- and finds the pages hollowed out 
                in the shape of a rock-hammer.</p>
              <p>259 EXT -- PRISON -- DAY (1966) 259</p>
              <p>Police cruisers everywhere. A media circus. REPORTERS jostle<br>
                for position. A colorless DISTRICT ATTORNEY steps forward into<br>
                CLOSEUP, flanked by a contingent of S.ATE TROOPERS.</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                Byron Hadley?</p>
              <p>ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal Captain Hadley. Staring. Waiting.</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right, 
                anything you say will be used against you in court...</p>
              <p>TROOPERS move in, cuffing Hadley's hands behind his back. The<br>
                D.A. drones on. FLASHBULBS POP. Hadley says nothing. His face<br>
                scrunches up. He begins to cry.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                I wasn't there to see it, but I hear Byron Hadley was sobbing 
                like a little girl when they took him away.</p>
              <p>Hadley sobs all the way to the car. The D.A. snaps a gaze up 
                toward Norton's window, motions his men to follow.</p>

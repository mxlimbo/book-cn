              <p>reveals the cell is empty. Everything neat and tidy. Even the 
                bunk is stowed. They wrench the door open and rush in, tossing 
                the cell in a panic as if Andy might be lurking under the Kleenex 
                or the toothpaste. CAMERA ROCKETS IN on Haig as he spins toward 
                us, bellowing at the top of his lungs:</p>
              <p>HAIG<br>
                WHAT THE FUCK!</p>
              <p>217 INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- MORNING (1966) 217</p>
              <p>Norton is kicking back with the morning paper. He notices how 
                dingy his shoes are. He glances at the shoebox on the desk. kicks 
                his shoes off, opens the box -- and gulls out Andy's o grimy work 
                shoes. He stares blankly. What the fuck indeed.</p>
              <p>An ALARM STARTS BLARING throughout the prison. He looks up.</p>
              <p>218 EXT -- PRISON -- DAY (1966) 218</p>
              <p>Norton and Hadley stride across the grounds, ALARM BLARING.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                I want every man on that cellblock questioned! Start with that 
                friend<br>
                of his!</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                who?</p>
              <p>219 INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- RED'S CELL -- DAY (1966) 219</p>
              <p>Red watches as Norton storms up with an entourage of guards.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Him.</p>
              <p>Red's eyes widen. Guards yank him from his cell.</p>
              <p>220 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- DAY (1966) 220</p>
              <p>Norton steps to the center of the room, working himself up into 
                a fine rage:</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                What do you mean &quot;he just wasn't here?&quot; Don't say that 
                to me, Haig!<br>
                Don't say that to me again!</p>
              <p>HAIG<br>
                But sir! He wasn't! He isn't!</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                I can see that, Haig! You think I'm blind? Is that what you're 
                saying?<br>
                Am I blind, Haig?</p>
              <p>HAIG<br>
                No sir!</p>
              <p>Norton grabs the clipboard and thrusts it at Hadley.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                What about you? You blind? Tell me what this is!</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                Last night's count.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                You see Dufresne's name? I sure do! Right there, see? &quot;Dufresne.&quot; 
                He was in his cell at lights out! Stands to reason he'd still 
                be here this morning! I want him found! Not tomorrow, not after 
                breakfast! Now!</p>
              <p>Haig scurries out, gathering men. Norton spins to Red.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Well?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Well what?</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                I see you two all the time, you're thick as thieves, you are! 
                He must'a said something!</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                No sir, he didn't!</p>
              <p>Norton spreads his arms evangelist-style, spins slowly around.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Lord! It's a miracle! Man up and vanished like a fart in the wind!<br>
                Nothin' left but some damn rocks on the windowsill and that cupcake 
                on the wall! Let's ask her! Maybe she knows! What say there, Fuzzy-<br>
                Britches? Feel like talking? Guess not. Why should you be different?</p>
              <p>Red exchanges looks with the guards. Even they're nervous. Norton 
                scoops a handful rocks off the sill. He hurls them at the wall 
                one at a time, shattering them, punctuating his words:</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                It's a conspiracy! (SMASH) That's what this is! (SMASH) It's one 
                big damn conspiracy! (SMASH) And everyone's in on it! (SMASH)<br>
                Including her!</p>
              <p>He sends the last rock whizzing right at Racquel. No smash.</p>
              <p>It takes a moment for this to sink in. All eyes go to her. The 
                rock went through her. There's a small hole in the poster where 
                her navel used to be.</p>
              <p>You could hear a pin drop. Norton reaches up, sinks his finger 
                into the hole. He keeps pushing...and his entire hand disappears 
                into the wall.</p>
              <p>221 ANGLE FROM BEHIND POSTER 221</p>
              <p>as Norton rips the poster from before our eyes. Stunned faces 
                peer in. CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK...to reveal the long crumbling 
                tunnel in the wall.</p>
              <p>222 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- MINUTES LATER (1966) 222</p>
              <p>RORY TREMONT, a guard barely out of his teens, tries not to look 
                nervous as they lash a rope around his chest. He's getting instructions 
                from six different people at once.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                They got this skinny kid named Rory Tremont to go in the hole. 
                He wasn't much in the brains department, but he possessed the 
                one most important qualification for the job...<br>
                (they slap a flashlight in his hands)<br>
                ...he was willing to go.</p>
              <p>223 INT -- TUNNEL -- DAY (1966) 223</p>
              <p>Rory squeezes down the tunnel on his belly.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Probably thought he'd win a Bronze Star or something.</p>
              <p>224 INT -- VERTICAL SHAFT -- DAY (1966) 224</p>
              <p>Dark as midnight. Concrete walls rise on both sides. If you imagine 
                them as two huge slices of bread, the meat of this particular 
                sandwich is about three feet of airspace and a dark tangle of 
                pipes between the cellblocks. Rory's appears, shining his flashlight 
                down the shaft. Somewhere, a rat SQUEAKS.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                It was his third day on the job.</p>
              <p>RORY<br>
                Warden? There's a space here between the walls 'bout three feet 
                across! Smells pretty damn bad!</p>
              <p>NORTON (O.S.)<br>
                I don't care what it smells like!</p>
              <p>HADLEY (O.S.)<br>
                Go on, boy! We got a hold of you!</p>
              <p>Looking none too happy about it, Rory squeezes from the tunnel 
                and dangles into the shaft. He gets lowered, shining his light, 
                smothered by darkness. Not having a good time.</p>
              <p>RORY<br>
                Hoo-whee! Smell's gettin' worse!</p>
              <p>NORTON (O.S.)<br>
                Never mind, I said! Just keep going!</p>
              <p>RORY<br>
                Smells pretty damn bad, Warden! In fact, it smells just like shit.</p>
              <p>His feet touch the ground -- or what he assumed was the ground. 
                It's not. In fact, it's just what it smells like. He sinks in 
                past his ankles. He slips and sits heavily in it.</p>
              <p>RORY<br>
                Oh God, that's what it is, it's shit. oh my God it's shit. pull 
                me out 'fore I blow my groceries, oh shit it's shit, oh my Gawwwwwwd!</p>
              <p>225 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- DAY (1966) 225</p>
              <p>Red and others listen to violent barfing from below.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                And then came the unmistakable sound of Rory Tremont losing his<br>
                last few meals. The whole cellblock heard it. I mean, it echoed.</p>
              <p>That's it for Red. He starts laughing. Laughing, hell, he's bellowing 
                laughter, laughing so hard he has to hold himself, laughing so 
                hard tears are pouring down his cheeks. The look of rage on Norton's 
                face makes him laugh all the harder.</p>
              <p>226 INT -- SOLITARY WING -- NIGHT (1966) 226</p>
              <p>Abrupt silence. LOW ANGLE on steel door.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                I laughed myself right into solitary. Two week stretch.</p>
              <p>227 INT -- SOLITARY -- NIGHT (1966) 227</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                It's shit, it's shit, oh my God it's shit...</p>
              <p>He starts laughing all over again, fit to split.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Andy once talked about doing easy time in the hole. Now I knew 
                what he meant.</p>
              <p>228 EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- WIDE SHOT -- DAY (1966) 228</p>
              <p>Virgin landscape. Charming rural road. Suddenly, State Police 
                cruisers rocket up the road with SIRENS AND LIGHTS.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                In 1966, Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank Prison.</p>
              <p>229 EXT -- FIELD -- DAY (1966) 229</p>
              <p>Shawshank is half a mile distant. WE TRACK ALONG a muddy creel 
                as STATE TROOPERS and PRISON GUARDS scour the brush. A TROOPEE 
                fishes a prison uniform out of the creek with a long stick.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                All they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes, a bar 
                of<br>
                soap, and an old rock-hammer damn near worn down to the nub.</p>
              <p>TROOPER g2 pulls the rock-hammer from the weeds. SWISH PAN<br>
                to a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER. His FLASHBULB GLARE produces:</p>
              <p>230 A BLACK AND WHITE STILL PHOTO 230</p>
              <p>of the hapless cops posing with Andy's reeking uniform and the<br>
                worn rock-hammer. PUSH IN on the hammer.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                I remember thinking it would take a man six hundred years to tunnel<br>
                through the wall with it. Andy did it in less than twenty.</p>
              <p>231 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 231</p>
              <p>Once again, we see Andy using the rock-hammer to scratch his 
                name into the cement. Suddenly, a palm-sized chunk of cement pops 
                free and hits the floor. He stares down at it.</p>
              <p>232 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 232</p>
              <p>Andy lies in the dark, studying the chunk of concrete in his 
                hands. Considering the possibilities. Wrestling with hope.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Andy loved geology. I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.<br>
                An ice age here, a million years of mountain-building there, plates 
                of<br>
                bedrock grinding against each other over a span of millennia...</p>
              <p>233 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 233</p>
              <p>Andy stands peering at the small hole left by the fallen chunk. 
                Carefully runs his fingertip over it.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Geology is the study of pressure and time. That's all it takes, 
                really. Pressure and time.</p>
              <p>234 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1951) 234</p>
              <p>Rita is now on the wall, hanging down over Andy's back.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                That and a big damn poster.</p>
              <p>TRACK IN to reveal Andy scraping patiently at the concrete.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Like I said. In prison, a man'll do most anything to keep his 
                mind<br>
                occupied.</p>
              <p>He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. He smoothes the poster down and 
                dives into bed. A GUARD strolls by a moment later, shining his<br>
                flashlight into the cell.</p>

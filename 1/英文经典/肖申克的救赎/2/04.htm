              <p>33 INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 33</p>
              <p>A DEAFENING NOISE of industrial washers and presses. Andy works 
                the laundry line. A nightmarish job. He's new at it. BOB, the<br>
                con foreman, elbows him aside and shows him how it's done.</p>
              <p>34 INT -- SHOWERS -- DAY (1947) 34</p>
              <p>Shower heads mounted in bare concrete. Andy showers with a<br>
                dozen or more men. No modesty here. At least the water is good<br>
                and hot, soothing his tortured muscles.</p>
              <p>Bogs looms from the billowing steam, smiling, checking Andy up<br>
                and down. Rooster and PETE appear from the sides. The Sisters.</p>
              <p>BOGS</p>
              <p>You're some sweet punk. You been broke in yet?</p>
              <p>Andy tries to step past them. He gets shoved around, nothing 
                serious, just some slap and tickle. Jackals sizing up prey.</p>
              <p>BOGS<br>
                Hard to get. I like that.</p>
              <p>Andy breaks free, flushed and shaking. He hurries off, leaving 
                the three Sisters laughing.</p>
              <p>35 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 35</p>
              <p>Andy lies staring at the darkness, unable to sleep.</p>
              <p>36 EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1947) 36</p>
              <p>Exercise period. Red plays catch with Heywood and Jigger, lazily 
                tossing a baseball around. Red notices Andy off to the side. Nods 
                hello. Andy takes this as a cue to amble over. Heywood and Jigger 
                pause, watching.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                (offers his hand)<br>
                Hello. I'm Andy Dufresne.</p>
              <p>Red glances at the hand, ignores it. The game continues.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                The wife-killin' banker.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                How do you know that?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                I keep my ear to the ground. Why'd you do it?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I didn't, since you ask.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Hell, you'll fit right in, then.<br>
                (off Andy's look)<br>
                Everyone's innocent in here, don't you know that? Heywood! What 
                are you in for, boy?</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Didn't do it! Lawyer fucked me!</p>
              <p>Red gives Andy a look. See?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                What else have you heard?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                People say you're a cold fish. They say you think your shit smells 
                sweeter than ordinary. That true?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                What do you think?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Ain't made up my mind yet.</p>
              <p>Heywood nudges Jigger. Watch this. He winds up and throws the<br>
                ball hard -- right at Andy's head. Andy sees it coming out of 
                the corner of his eye, whirls and catches it. Beat. He sends the 
                ball right back, zinging it into Heywood's hands. Heywood drops 
                the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I understand you're a man who knows how to get things.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. They seem 
                to<br>
                fall into my hands. Maybe it's 'cause I'm Irish.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I wonder if you could get me a rock-hammer?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                What is it and why?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                You make your customers' motives a part of your business?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                If you wanted a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask questions. I'd just 
                quote a price. A toothbrush, see, is a non-lethal sort of object.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about eight or nine inches long. 
                Looks like a miniature pickaxe, with a small sharp pick on one 
                end, and a blunt hammerhead on the other. It's for rocks.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Rocks.</p>
              <p>Andy squats, motions Red to join him. Andy grabs a handful of 
                dirt and sifts it through his hands. He finds a pebble and rubs 
                it clean. It has a nice milky glow. He tosses it to Red.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Quartz?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. Silted granite. There's some 
                graded limestone, from when they cut this place out of the hill.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                So?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I'm a rockhound. At least I was, in my old life. I'd like to be 
                again,<br>
                on a limited scale.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Yeah, that or maybe plant your toy in somebody's skull?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I have no enemies here.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                No? Just wait.</p>
              <p>Red flicks his gaze past Andy. Bogs is watching them.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Word gets around. The Sisters have taken a real shine to you, 
                yes they have. Especially Bogs.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Tell me something. Would it help if I explained to them I'm not<br>
                homosexual?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Neither are they. You have to be human first. They don't qualify.<br>
                (off Andy's look)<br>
                Bull queers take by force, that's all they want or understand. 
                I'd<br>
                grow eyes in the back of my head if I were you.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Thanks for the advice.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                That comes free. But you understand my concern.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                If there's trouble, I doubt a rock- hammer will do me any good.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Then I guess you wanna escape. Tunnel under the wall maybe?<br>
                (Andy laughs politely)<br>
                I miss the joke. What's so funny?</p>
              <p>ANDY</p>
              <p>You'll know when you see the rock- hammer.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                What's this item usually go for?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                My standard mark-up's twenty percent, but we're talkin' about 
                a<br>
                special object. Risk goes up, price goes up. Call it ten bucks 
                even.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Ten it is.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                I'll see what I can do.<br>
                (rises, slapping dust)<br>
                But it's a waste of money.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Oh?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Folks who run this place love surprise inspections. They turn 
                a blind eye to some things, but not a gadget like that. They'll 
                find it, and you'll lose it. Mention my name, we'll never do business 
                again. Not for a pair of shoelaces or a stick of gum.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I understand. Thank you, Mr...?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Red. The name's Red.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Red. I'm Andy. Pleasure doing business with you.</p>
              <p>They shake. Andy strolls off. Red watches him go.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a 
                quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal 
                around<br>
                here. He strolled. like a man in a park without a care or worry. 
                Like<br>
                he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.<br>
                (resumes playing catch)<br>
                Yes, I think it would be fair to say I liked Andy from the start.</p>
              <p>37 INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1947) 37</p>
              <p>Red gets his breakfast and heads for a table. Andy falls in step, 
                slips him a tightly-folded square of paper.</p>
              <p>38 INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 38</p>
              <p>Lying on his bunk, Red unfolds the square. A ten dollar bill.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                He was a man who adapted fast.</p>
              <p>39 EXT -- LOADING DOCK -- DAY (1947) 39</p>
              <p>Under watchful supervision, CONS are off-loading bags of dirty<br>
                laundry from an &quot;Eliot Nursing Home&quot; truck.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Years later, I found out he'd brought in quite a bit more than 
                just ten dollars...</p>
              <p>A certain bag hits the ground. The TRUCK DRIVER shoots a look<br>
                at a black con, LEONARD, then ambles over to a GUARD to shoot<br>
                the shit. Leonard loads the bag onto a cart...</p>
              <p>40 INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 40</p>
              <p>Bags are being unloaded. We find Leonard working the line.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                When they check you into this hotel, one of the bellhops bends 
                you over and looks up your works, just to make sure you're not 
                carrying anything. But a truly determined man can get an object 
                quite a ways up there.</p>
              <p>Leonard slips a small paper-wrapped package out of the laundry 
                bag, hides it under his apron, and keeps sorting...</p>
              <p>4l INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY EXCHANGE -- DAY (1947) 41</p>
              <p>Red deposits his dirty bundle and moves down the line to where 
                the clean sheets are being handed out.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                That's how Andy joined our happy little Shawshank family with 
                more<br>
                than five hundred dollars on his person. Determination.</p>
              <p>Leonard catches Red's eye, turns and grabs a specific stack of 
                clean sheets. He hands it across to Red --</p>
              <p>TIGHT ANGLE</p>
              <p>-- and more than clean laundry changes hands. Two packs of cigarettes 
                slide out of Red's hand into Leonard's.</p>
              <p>42 INT -- RED'S CELL -- DAY (1947) 42</p>
              <p>Red slips the package out of his sheets, carefully checks to 
                make sure nobody's coming, then rips it open. He pulls out the 
                rock-hammer. It's just as Andy described. Red laughs softly.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Andy was right. I finally got the joke. It would take a man about 
                six<br>
                hundred years to tunnel under the wall with one of these.</p>

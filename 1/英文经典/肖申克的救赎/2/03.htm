              <p>17 INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1947) 17</p>
              <p>Three tiers to a side, concrete and steel, gray and imposing.<br>
                Andy and the others are marched in, still naked, carrying their 
                clothes and Bibles. The CONS in their cells greet them with TAUNTS, 
                JEERS, and LAUGHTER. One by one, the new men are shown to their 
                cells and locked in with a CLANG OF STEEL.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it. They march 
                you in<br>
                naked as the day you're born, fresh from a Bible reading, skin 
                burning<br>
                and half-blind from that delousing shit they throw on you...</p>
              <p>Red watches from his cell, arms slung over the crossbars, cigarette 
                dangling from his fingers.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                ...and when they put you in that cell, when those bars slam home,<br>
                that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the 
                blink of<br>
                an eye...a long cold season in hell stretching out ahead...nothing 
                left but all the time in the world to think about it.</p>
              <p>Red listens to the CLANGING below. He watches Andy and a few<br>
                others being brought up to the 2nd tier.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Most new fish come close to madness the first night. Somebody 
                always breaks down crying. Happens every time. The only question 
                is, who's it gonna be?</p>
              <p>Andy is led past and given a cell at the end of the tier.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess. I had my money 
                on<br>
                Andy Dufresne...</p>
              <p>18 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 18</p>
              <p>The bars slam home. Andy is alone in his cell, clutching his 
                clothes. He gazes around at his new surroundings, taking it in. 
                He slowly begins to dress himself...</p>
              <p>19 EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- NIGHT (1947) 19</p>
              <p>A malignant stone growth on the Maine landscape. The moon<br>
                hangs low and baleful in a dead sky. The headlight of a PASSING 
                TRAIN cuts through the night.</p>
              <p>20 INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 20</p>
              <p>Red lies on his bunk below us, tossing his baseball toward the<br>
                ceiling and catching it again. He pauses, listening. FOOTSTEPS<br>
                approach below, unhurried, echoing hollowly on stone.</p>
              <p>21 INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1947) 21</p>
              <p>LOW ANGLE. A CELLBLOCK GUARD strolls into frame.</p>
              <p>GUARD<br>
                That's lights out! Good night, ladies.</p>
              <p>The lights bump off in sequence. The guard exits, footsteps<br>
                echoing away. Darkness now. Silence. CAMERA CRANES UP the<br>
                tiers toward Red's cell.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                I remember my first night. Seems a long time ago now.</p>
              <p>Red looms from the darkness, leans on the bars. Listens. Waits. 
                From somewhere below comes faint, ghastly tittering. VOICES drift 
                through the cellblock, taunting:</p>
              <p>VARIOUS VOICES (O.S.)<br>
                Fishee fishee fisheeee...You're gonna like it here, new fish. 
                A<br>
                whooole lot...Make you wish your daddies never dicked your mommies...You 
                takin' this down, new fish? Gonna be a quiz later.<br>
                (somebody LAUGHS)<br>
                Sshhh. Keep it down. The screws'll hear...Fishee fishee fisheeee...</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                The boys always go fishin' with first-timers...and they don't 
                quit till they reel someone in.</p>
              <p>The VOICES keep on, sly and creepy in the dark...</p>
              <p>22 INT -- VARIOUS CELLS -- NIGHT (1947) 22<br>
                thru thru 25<br>
                2g ...while the new cons go quietly crazy in their cells. One 
                man paces like a caged animal...another sits gnawing his cuticles 
                bloody...a third is weeping silently...a fourth is dry-heaving 
                into the toilet...</p>
              <p>26 INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 26</p>
              <p>Red waits at the bars. Smoking. Listening. He cranes his head, 
                peers down toward Andy's cell. Nothing. Not a peep.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD (O.S.)<br>
                Fat-Ass...oh, Faaaat-Ass. Talk to me, boy. I know you're in there. 
                I<br>
                can hear you breathin'. Now don't you listen to these nitwits, 
                hear?</p>
              <p>27 INT -- FAT-ASS' CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 27</p>
              <p>Fat-Ass is crying, trying not to hyperventilate.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD (O.S.)<br>
                This ain't such a bad place. I'll introduce you around, make you 
                feel<br>
                right at home. I know some big ol' bull queers who'd love to make 
                your acquaintance...especially that big white mushy butt of yours...</p>
              <p>And that's it. Fat-Ass lets out a LOUD WAIL of despair:</p>
              <p>FAT-ASS<br>
                OH GOD! I DON'T BELONG HERE! I<br>
                WANNA GO HOME!</p>
              <p>28 INT -- HEYWOOD'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 28</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                AND IT'S FAT-ASS BY A NOSE.'</p>
              <p>29 INT -- CELLBLOCK -- NIGHT (1947) 29</p>
              <p>The place goes nuts. Fat-Ass throws himself screaming against<br>
                the bars. The entire block starts CHANTING:</p>
              <p>VOICES<br>
                Fresh fish...fresh fish...fresh fish...fresh fish...</p>
              <p>FAT-ASS<br>
                I WANNA GO HOME! I WANT MY MOTHER.'</p>
              <p>VOICE (O.S.)<br>
                I had your mother! She wasn't that great!</p>
              <p>The lights bump on. GUARDS pour in, led by Hadley himself.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                What the Christ is this happy shit?</p>
              <p>VOICE (O.S.)<br>
                He took the Lord's name in vain! I'm tellin' the warden!</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                (to the unseen wit)<br>
                You'll be tellin' him with my baton up your ass!</p>
              <p>Hadley arrives at Fat-Ass' cell, bellowing through the bars:</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                What's your malfunction you fat fuckin' barrel of monkey-spunk?</p>
              <p>FAT-ASS<br>
                PLEASE! THIS AIN'T RIGHT! I AIN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE! NOT ME!</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                I ain't gonna count to three! Not even to one! Now shut the fuck 
                up<br>
                'fore I sing you a lullabye!</p>
              <p>Fat-Ass keeps blubbering and wailing. Total freak-out. Hadley 
                draws his baton, gestures to his men. Open it.</p>
              <p>A GUARD unlocks the cell. Hadley pulls Fat-Ass out and starts 
                beating him with the baton, brutally raining blows. Fat-Ass falls, 
                tries to crawl.</p>
              <p>The place goes dead silent. All we hear now is the dull<br>
                THWACK-THWACK-THWACK of the baton. Fat-ass passes out. Hadley 
                gets in a few more licks and finally stops.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                Get this tub of shit down to the infirmary.<br>
                (peers around)<br>
                If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here the rest of the night, 
                by God and Sonny Jesus, you'll all visit the infirmary. Every 
                last motherfucker here.</p>
              <p>The guards wrestle Fat-Ass onto a stretcher and carry him off. 
                FOOTSTEPS echo away. Lights off. Darkness again. Silence.</p>
              <p>30 INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 30</p>
              <p>Red stares through the bars at the main floor below, eyes riveted 
                to the small puddle of blood where Fat-Ass went down.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                His first night in the joint, Andy Dufresne cost me two packs 
                of<br>
                cigarettes. He never made a sound...</p>
              <p>31 INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- MORNING (1947) 31</p>
              <p>LOUD BUZZER. The master locks are thrown -- KA-THUMP! The cons 
                step from their cells, lining the tiers. The GUARDS holler their 
                head-counts to the HEAD BULL, who jots on a clipboard. Red peers 
                at Andy, checking him out. Andy stands in line, collar buttoned, 
                hair combed.</p>
              <p>32 INT -- MESS HALL -- MORNING (1947) 32</p>
              <p>Andy goes through the breakfast line, gets a scoop of glop on 
                his tray. WE PAN ANDY through the noise and confusion...and discover 
                BOGS DIAMOND and ROOSTER MacBRIDE watching Andy go by. Bogs sizes 
                Andy up with a salacious gleam in his eye,<br>
                mutters something to Rooster. Rooster laughs.</p>
              <p>Andy finds a table occupied by Red and his regulars, chooses 
                a spot at the end where nobody is sitting. Ignoring their stares, 
                he picks up his spoon -- and pauses, seeing something in his food. 
                He carefully fishes it out with his fingers.</p>
              <p>It's a squirming maggot. Andy grimaces, unsure what to do with 
                it. BROOKS HATLEN is sitting closest to Andy. At age 65, he's 
                a senior citizen, a long-standing resident.</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                You gonna eat that?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Hadn't planned on it.</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                You mind?</p>
              <p>Andy passes the maggot to Brooks. Brooks examines it, rolling 
                it between his fingertips like a man checking out a fine cigar. 
                Andy is riveted with apprehension.</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                Mmm. Nice and ripe.</p>
              <p>Andy can't bear to watch. Brooks opens up his sweater and feeds 
                the maggot to a baby crow nestled in an inside pocket. Andy breathes 
                a sigh of relief.</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                Jake says thanks. Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop. 
                I'm<br>
                lookin' after him till he's old enough to fly.</p>
              <p>Andy nods, proceeds to eat. Carefully. Heywood approaches.</p>
              <p>JIGGER<br>
                Oh, Christ, here he comes.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Mornin', boys. It's a fine mornin'. You know why it's fine?</p>
              <p>Heywood plops his tray down, sits. The men start pulling out 
                cigarettes and handing them down.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                That's right, send 'em all down. I wanna see 'em lined up in a 
                row,<br>
                pretty as a chorus line.</p>
              <p>An impressive pile forms. Heywood bends down and inhales deeply, 
                smelling the aroma. Rapture.</p>
              <p>FLOYD<br>
                Smell my ass...</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Gee, Red. Terrible shame, your horse comin' in last and all. Hell, 
                I sure do love that horse of mine. I believe I owe that boy a 
                big sloppy kiss when I see him.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Give him some'a your cigarettes instead, cheap bastard.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Say Tyrell, you pull infirmary duty this week? How's that winnin' 
                horse of mine, anyway?</p>
              <p>TYRELL<br>
                Dead.<br>
                (the men fall silent)<br>
                Hadley busted his head pretty good. Doc already went home for 
                the<br>
                night. Poor bastard lay there till this morning. By then...</p>
              <p>He shakes his head, turns back to his food. The silence mounts. 
                Heywood glances around. Men resume eating. Softly:</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                What was his name?</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                What? What'd you say?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I was wondering if anyone knew his name.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                What the fuck you care, new fish?<br>
                (resumes eating)<br>
                Doesn't matter what his fuckin' name was. He's dead.</p>

              <p>Poker game in progress. Tommy, Andy, Red and the boys.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                You did a stretch in Cashman too?</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                Yeah. That was an easy ride, let me tell you. Work programs, eekend<br>
                furloughs. Not like here.</p>
              <p>SNOOZE<br>
                Sounds like you done time all over New England.</p>
              <p>TOMNY<br>
                Been in and out since I was 13. Name the place, chances are I 
                been there.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Perhaps it's time you considered a new profession.<br>
                (the game stalls)<br>
                What I mean is, you don't seem to be a very good thief. Maybe 
                you<br>
                should try something else.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                What the hell you know about it, Capone? What are you in for?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                (wry glance to Red)<br>
                Everyone's innocent in here. Don't you know that?</p>
              <p>The tension breaks. Everyone laughs.</p>
              <p>177 INT -- VISITOR'S ROOM -- DAY (1965) 177</p>
              <p>CAMERA TRAVELS the room. Chaotic. CONS are waiting their turn 
                or talking to visitors through a thick plexi shield.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                As it turns out, Tommy had himself a young wife and new baby girl...</p>
              <p>Tommy's at the end of the row, phone to his ear. Other side of 
                the glass is BETH, near tears, fussing with a BABY on her lap.</p>
              <p>BETH<br>
                ...said we can stay with them, but Joey's gettin' out of the service 
                next month, and they barely got enough room as it is. Plus they 
                got Poppa workin' double shifts and the baby cries half the night. 
                I just don't know where we're gonna go...</p>
              <p>PUSH IN on Tommy's face as he listens.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Maybe it was the thought of them on the streets...or his child 
                growing<br>
                up not knowing her daddy...</p>
              <p>178 INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 178</p>
              <p>Tommy enters, the strut gone from his step. A little scared. 
                He finds Andy filing library cards.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Whatever it was, something lit a fire under that boy's ass.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                I'm thinkin' maybe I should try for high school equivalency. Hear 
                you<br>
                helped some fellas with that.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.</p>
              <p>TOMNY<br>
                (tight)<br>
                I ain't no goddamn loser.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                That's a good start. If we do this, we do it all the way. One 
                hundred<br>
                percent. Nothing half-assed.</p>
              <p>Tommy thinks about it, nods.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                Thing is, see...<br>
                (leans in, mutters)<br>
                ...I don't read all that good.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                Well. You've come to the right place then.</p>
              <p>179 INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 179</p>
              <p>We find Andy giving an impassioned reading:</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                &quot;...and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow 
                on the<br>
                floor...and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on 
                the<br>
                floor, shall be lifted nevermore!&quot;</p>
              <p>Andy slaps the book shut, immensely pleased with himself.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                So this raven just sits there and won't go away?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                That's right.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                (beat)<br>
                Why don't that fella get hisself a 12-gauge and dust the fucker?</p>
              <p>180 INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 180</p>
              <p>Tommy tries to read as Andy looks on:</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                &quot;The cat sh--The cat shh...&quot;<br>
                (glances up)<br>
                The cat shat on the welcome mat?</p>
              <p>Andy shakes his head. Not exactly.</p>
              <p>181 INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 181</p>
              <p>Andy chalks the alphabet on a blackboard.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                So Andy took Tommy under his wing. Started walking him through 
                his ABCs...</p>
              <p>182 INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1965) 182</p>
              <p>TRACK the table to Tommy and Andy. Discussing a book.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Tommy took to it pretty well, too. Boy found brains he never knew 
                he<br>
                had.</p>
              <p>183 EXT -- EXERCISE YARD BLEACHERS -- DAY (1965) 183</p>
              <p>TOMNY<br>
                The cat sh--shh--shimmied up the tree and crept st--stel--stealthily<br>
                out on the limb...</p>
              <p>184 INT -- WOOD SHOP -- DAY (1965) 184</p>
              <p>Tommy intent on a paperback, mouthing the words. Behind him,<br>
                wood is piling up on the conveyor belt.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                After a while, you couldn't pry those books out of hands.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Ass in gear, son! You're putting us behind!</p>
              <p>Tommy shoves the book in his back pocket and hurries over.</p>
              <p>185 INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 185</p>
              <p>Tommy writes a sentence on the blackboard. Andy steps in, shows 
                him how to reconstruct it.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Before long, Andy started him on his course requirements. He really<br>
                liked the kid, that was part of it. Gave him a thrill to help 
                a youngster crawl off the shitheap. But that wasn't the only reason...</p>
              <p>186 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 186</p>
              <p>TIGHT ANGLE on chessboard. Most of the pieces complete. PAN TO 
                Andy lying in his bunk, carefully polishing...</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Prison time is slow time. Sometimes it feels like stop-time. So 
                you do<br>
                what you can to keep going...</p>
              <p>...and we keep going past Andy in a SLOW PAN of the cell. Sink. 
                Toilet. Books. Outside the window bars, we hear another TRAIN 
                passing in the night...</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Some fellas collect stamps. Others build matchstick houses. Andy 
                built a library. Now he needed a new project. Tommy was it. It 
                was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those 
                rocks. The same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall...</p>
              <p>...STILL PANNING, past a chair, a sweater on a hook...and finally 
                to the place of honor on the wall...</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                In prison, a man'll do most anything to keep his mind occupied.</p>
              <p>...where the latest poster turns out to be Racquel Welch ins 
                fur bikini. Gorgeous. &quot;One Million Years, B. C. &quot; SLOW 
                PUSH IN,</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                By 1966...right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take 
                his<br>
                exams...it was lovely Racquel.</p>
              <p>187 INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1966) 187</p>
              <p>Tommy's taking the big test. Andy's monitoring the time. Deep<br>
                silence, save for Tommy's pencil-scribbling. A few old-timers 
                are browsing the shelves, sneaking looks their way. Tommy tries 
                to ignore them. Concentrate.</p>
              <p>Andy clears his throat. Time's up. Tommy puts his pencil down,</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Well?</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                Well. It's for shit.<br>
                (gets up in disgust)<br>
                Wasted a whole fuckin' year of my time with this bullshit!</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                May not be as bad as you think.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                It's worse! I didn't get a fuckin' thing right! Might as well 
                be in Chinese!</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                We'll see how the score comes out.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out...</p>
              <p>Tommy grabs the test, wads it, slam-dunks it into the trash.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                Two points! Right there! There's your goddamn score!<br>
                (storms out)<br>
                Goddamn cats crawlin' up trees, 5 times 5 is 25, fuck this place, 
                fuck it!</p>
              <p>Tommy is gone. Red and others stare. Andy gets up, pulls the 
                test from the trash, smoothes it out on the desk.</p>
              <p>188 INT -- WOOD SHOP -- DAY (1966) 188</p>
              <p>Rest break. Tommy and Red sipping Cokes.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                I feel bad. I let him down.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                That's crap, son. He's proud of you. Proud as a hen.<br>
                (off Tommy's look)<br>
                We been friends a long time. I know him as good as anybody.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                Smart fella, ain't he?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Smart as they come. Used to be a banker on the outside.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                What's he in for anyway?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Murder.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                The hell you say.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                You wouldn't think, lookin' at him. Caught his wife in bed with 
                some<br>
                golf pro. Greased 'em both. C'mon, boy, back to work...</p>
              <p>SMASH! Red turns back. Tommy's Coke has slipped from his hand<br>
                and shattered on the floor. The kid's gone white as a sheet.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                (bare whisper)<br>
                Oh my God...</p>
              <p>189 INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1966) 189</p>
              <p>Tommy sits before Andy and Red:</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                'Bout four years ago, I was in Thomaston on a 2 to 3 stretch. 
                Stole a car. Dumbfuck thing to do.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                Few months left to go, I get a new cellmate in. Elmo Blatch. Big<br>
                twitchy fucker. Crazy eyes. Kind of roomie you pray you don't 
                get, know what I'm sayin'? 6 to 12 for armed burglary. Said he 
                done hundreds of jobs. Hard to believe, high-strung as he was. 
                Cut a loud fart, he'd go three feet in the air. Talked all the 
                time, too, that's the other thing. Never shut up. Places he'd 
                been, jobs he pulled, women he fucked. Even people he killed. 
                People that gave him shit, that's<br>
                how he put it. One night, like a joke, I say: &quot;Yeah? Who'd 
                you kill?&quot; So he says...</p>
              <p>BLATCH<br>
                ...I got me this job one time bussin' tables at a country club. 
                So I could case all the big rich pricks that come in. I pick out 
                this guy, go in one night and do his place. He wakes up and gives 
                me shit. So I killed him. Him and the tasty bitch he was with.<br>
                (starts laughing)<br>
                That's the best part! She's fuckin' this prick, see, this golf 
                pro, but she's married to some other guy! Some hotshot banker. 
                He's the one<br>
                they pinned it on! They got him down-Maine somewhere doin' time 
                for the crime! Ain't that choice?</p>
              <p>He throws his head back and ROARS with laughter.</p>

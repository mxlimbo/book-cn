              <p>Silence. Tommy has finished his story. Red is stunned...but Andy 
                looks like he's been smacked with a two by four.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Andy?</p>
              <p>Andy says nothing. Walks stiffly away. Doesn't look back.</p>
              <p>192 INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 192</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Well. I have to say, that's the most amazing story I ever heard. 
                What amazes me most is you were taken in by it.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Sir?</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                It's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you. He hears 
                your tale of woe and quite naturally wants to cheer you up. He's 
                young, not terribly bright. Not surprising he didn't know what 
                a state he'd put you in.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I think he's telling the truth.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Let's say for a moment Blatch does exist. You think he'd just 
                fall to<br>
                his knees and cry, &quot;Yes, I did it! I confess! By all means, 
                please add<br>
                a life term to my sentence!&quot;</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                It wouldn't matter. With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                That's assuming Blatch is even still there. Chances are excellent 
                he'd be released by now. Excellent.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                They'd have his last known address. Names of relatives...<br>
                (Norton shakes his head)<br>
                Well it's a chance. isn't it? How can you be so obtuse?</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                What? What did you call me?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Obtuse! Is it deliberate? The country club will have his old time 
                cards! W-2s with his name on them!</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                (rises)<br>
                Dufresne, if you want to indulge this fantasy, that's your business.<br>
                Don't make it mine. This meeting's over.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Look, if it's the squeeze, don't worry. I'd never say what goes 
                on in here. I'd be just as indictable as you for laundering the 
                money!</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Don't you ever mention money to me again, you sorry son of a bitch!<br>
                Not in this office, not anywhere!<br>
                (slaps intercom)<br>
                Get in here! Now!</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I was just trying to rest your mind at ease, that's all.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                (as GUARDS enter)<br>
                Solitary! A month!</p>
              <p>Andy gets dragged away, kicking and screaming:</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                What's the matter with you? It's my chance to get out, don't you 
                see<br>
                that? It's my life! Don't you understand it's my life?</p>
              <p>193 EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1966) 193</p>
              <p>Mail call. Men crowd around as names are called out. Red and 
                the boys are parked on the bleachers.</p>
              <p>FLOYD<br>
                A month in the hole. Longest damn stretch I ever heard of.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                It's my fault.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Like hell. You didn't pull the trigger, and you didn't convict 
                him.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Red? You saying Andy's innocent? I mean for real innocent?<br>
                (Red nods)<br>
                Sweet Jesus. How long's he been in here?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Since '47. Going on nineteen years.</p>
              <p>MAIL CALLER<br>
                Thomas Williams!</p>
              <p>Tommy raises his hand. The envelope gets tossed to him. He stares 
                at it. Red peers over his shoulder.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Board of Education.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                The son of a bitch mailed it.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Looks that way. You gonna open it or stick your thumb up your 
                butt?</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                Thumb up my butt sounds better.</p>
              <p>He gets hemmed in by the older men. Red snatches the letter.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                C'mon, just throw it away. Will you please? Just throw it away?</p>
              <p>Red rips it open, scans the letter. Expressionless.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Well, shit.</p>
              <p>194 INT -- VISITOR'S ROOM -- DAY (1966) 194</p>
              <p>Tommy makes his way through the chaos, finds Beth and the baby<br>
                waiting behind the thick plexi shield. He sits, doesn't pick up 
                the phone. Just stares at Beth. She doesn't know what to make 
                of it.</p>
              <p>He presses a piece of paper against the glass. A high school 
                diploma. Her face lights up, blinking back tears.</p>
              <p>195 INT -- SOLITARY WING -- NIGHT (1966) 195</p>
              <p>LOW ANGLE on steel door. Somewhere behind it, unseen, is Andy,<br>
                A rat scurries along the wall. FOOTSTEPS approach slowly.</p>
              <p>196 INT -- SOLITARY -- NIGHT (1966) 196</p>
              <p>Andy listens in darkness. The FOOTSTEPS pause outside his door. 
                The slot opens. An ELDERLY GUARD peers in.</p>
              <p>ELDERLY GUARD<br>
                Kid passed. C-plus average. Thought you'd like to know.</p>
              <p>The slot closes. The FOOTSTEPS recede. Andy smiles.</p>
              <p>197 INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1966) 197</p>
              <p>We find Tommy on evening work detail, mopping the floors with<br>
                bucket and pail. Mert Entwhistle comes into view.</p>
              <p>MERT<br>
                Warden wants to talk.</p>
              <p>198 EXT -- PRISON -- NIGHT (1966) 198</p>
              <p>A steel door rattles open. Mert leads Tommy outside to a gate,<br>
                unlocks it. Tommy looks around.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                Out here?</p>
              <p>MERT<br>
                That's what the man said.</p>
              <p>Mert swings the gate open, sends Tommy through, turns and heads 
                back inside. Tommy proceeds out across a loading-dock access for 
                the shops and mills. Some vehicles parked. The place is deserted. 
                He stops, sensing a presence.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                Warden?</p>
              <p>Norton steps into the light.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Tommy, we've got a situation here. I think you can appreciate 
                that.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                Yes sir, I sure can.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                I tell you, son, this really came along and knocked my wind out. 
                It's<br>
                got me up nights, that's the truth.</p>
              <p>Norton pulls a pack of cigarettes, offers Tommy a smoke. Tommy<br>
                takes one. Norton lights both cigarettes, pockets his lighter.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                The right decision. Sometimes it's hard to figure out what that 
                is.<br>
                You understand?<br>
                (Tommy nods)<br>
                Think hard, Tommy. If I'm gonna move on this, there can't be the<br>
                least little shred of doubt. I have to know if you what you told<br>
                Dufresne was the truth.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                Yes sir. Absolutely.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury...having 
                placed<br>
                your hand on the Good Book and taken an oath before Almighty God 
                Himself?</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                Just gimme that chance.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                That's what I thought.</p>
              <p>Norton drops his cigarette. Crushes it out with the toe of his 
                shoe. Glances up toward the plate shop roof as --</p>
              <p>199 HIGH ANGLE FROM PLATE SHOP ROOF (SNIPER POV) 199</p>
              <p>-- a rifle scope pops up into frame, jumping Tommy's image into 
                startling magnification, framed in the crosshairs.</p>
              <p>200 THE SNIPER 200</p>
              <p>rapid-fires a carbine -- BLAM!BLAM!BLAM!BLAM! -- his face lit<br>
                up by the muzzle flashes. Captain Hadley.</p>
              <p>201 TOMMY 201</p>
              <p>gets chewed to pieces by the gunfire. He smacks the ground in 
                a twitching, thrashing heap. Eyes wide and staring. Dead. Surprise 
                still stamped on his face. Silence now. Norton turns, strolls 
                into darkness.</p>
              <p>202 INT -- SOLITARY WING -- DAY (1966) 202</p>
              <p>GUARDS approach Andy's cell. The door is unlocked. Andy<br>
                emerges slowly, blinking painfully at the light.</p>
              <p>203 INT/EXT -- PRISON -- DAY (1966) 203</p>
              <p>Andy is marched along. Convicts stop to stare.</p>
              <p>204 INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 204</p>
              <p>Andy is led in. The door is closed. Alone with Norton. Softly,</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Terrible thing. Man that young, less than a year to go, trying 
                to escape. Broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him, truly it 
                did.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I'm done. It stops right now. Get H&amp;R Block to declare your 
                income.</p>
              <p>Norton lunges to his feet, eyes sparkling with rage.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Nothing stops! NOTHING!<br>
                (tight)<br>
                Or you will do the hardest time there is. No more protection from<br>
                the guards. I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton and put 
                you in<br>
                (MORE)</p>
              <p>-<br>
                NORTON (cont.)<br>
                with the biggest bull queer I can find. You'll think you got fucked 
                by a train! And the library? Gone! Sealed off brick by brick! 
                We'll have us a little book-barbecue in the yard! They'll see 
                the flames for miles! We'll dance around it like wild Indians! 
                Do you understand me? Are you catching my drift?</p>
              <p>SLOW PUSH IN on Andy's face. Eyes hollow. His beaten expression 
                says it all...</p>

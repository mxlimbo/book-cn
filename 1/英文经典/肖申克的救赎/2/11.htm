              <p>Red is making a sign, carefully routing letters into a long plank 
                of wood. It turns out to be --</p>
              <p>160 INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1963) 160</p>
              <p>-- the varnished wood sign over the archway: &quot;Brooks Hatlen 
                Memorial Library.&quot; TILT DOWN to reveal the library in all 
                its completed glory: shelves lined with books, tables and chairs, 
                even a few potted plants. Heywood is wearing headphones, listening 
                to Hank Williams on the record player.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                By the year Kennedy was shot, Andy had transformed a broom closet 
                smelling of turpentine into the best prison library in New England.</p>

              <p>FLASHBULBS POP as Norton addresses MEMBERS OF THE PRESS:</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                That was also the year Warden Norton instituted his famous &quot;Inside-Out&quot; 
                program. You may remember reading about it. It made all the papers 
                and got his picture in LIFE magazine.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                ...a genuine, progressive advance in corrections and rehabilitation.<br>
                Our inmates, properly supervised, will be put to work outside 
                these<br>
                walls performing all manner of public service. Cutting pulpwood,<br>
                repairing bridges and causeways, digging storm drains...</p>
              <p>ANGLE TO Red and the boys listening from behind the fence.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                These men can learn the value of an honest day's labor while providing 
                a valuable service to the community -- and at a bare minimum of 
                expense to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer!</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Sounds like road-gangin', you ask me.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Nobody asked you.</p>
              <p>162 EXT -- HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY (1963) 162</p>
              <p>A ROAD-GANG is grading a culvert with picks. There's dust and<br>
                the smell of sweat in the air. GUARDS patrol with sniper rifles, 
                A pushy WOMAN REPORTER in an ugly hat bustles up the grade,<br>
                trailed by a PHOTOGRAPHER.</p>
              <p>WOMAN REPORTER<br>
                You there! You men! We're gonna take your picture now!</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Give us a break, lady.</p>
              <p>WOMAN REPORTER<br>
                Don't you know who I am? I'm from LIFE magazine! I was told I'd 
                get some co-operation out here! You want me to report you to your<br>
                warden? Is that what you want?</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                (sighs)<br>
                No, ma'am.</p>
              <p>WOMAN REPORTER<br>
                That's more like it! Now I want you all in a row with big bright 
                smiles<br>
                on your faces! Grab hold of your tools and show 'em to me!</p>
              <p>She turns, motioning her photographer up the grade. Heywood glances 
                around at the other men.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                You heard the lady.</p>
              <p>Heywood unzips his pants, reaches inside. The others do likewise. 
                The woman turns back and is greeted by the sight of a dozen men 
                displaying their penises and smiling brightly. Her legs go wobbly 
                and she sits heavily down on the dirt grade.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                C'mon! We're showin' our tools and grinnin' like fools! Take the 
                damn<br>
                picture!</p>

              <p>Heywood sits alone in the dark. He sighs.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                None of the inmates were invited to express their views...</p>
              <p>164 EXT -- WOODED FIELDS -- DAY (1965) 164</p>
              <p>A ROAD-GANG is pulling stumps, bogged down in mud.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                'Course, Norton failed to mention to the press that &quot;bare 
                minimum of<br>
                expense&quot; is a fairly loose term. There are a hundred different 
                ways to skim off the top. Men, materials, you name it. And, oh 
                my Lord, how the money rolled in...</p>
              <p>Norton strolls into view with NED GRIMES at his heels.</p>
              <p>NED<br>
                This keeps up, you're gonna put me out of business! With this 
                pool of slave labor you got, you can underbid any contractor in 
                town.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Ned, we're providing a valuable community service.</p>
              <p>NED<br>
                That's fine for the papers, but I got a family to feed. The State 
                don't pay my salary. Sam, we go back a long way. I need this new 
                highway contract. I don't get it, I go under. That's a fact.<br>
                (hands him a box)<br>
                Now you just have some'a this fine pie my missus baked specially 
                for<br>
                you, and you think about that.</p>
              <p>Norton opens the box. Alongside the pie is an envelope. He runs 
                his thumb across the thick stack of cash it contains.</p>
              <p>IN THE BACKGROUND, a winch cable SNAPS and whips through the 
                air, damn near severing a man's leg. He goes down, screaming in 
                mud and blood, pinned by a fallen tree stump. Men rush over to 
                help him. Norton barely takes notice.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Ned, I wouldn't worry too much over this contract. Seems to me 
                I've<br>
                already got my boys committed elsewhere. You be sure and thank<br>
                Maisie for this fine pie.</p>
              <p>165 INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- NIGHT (1965) 165</p>
              <p>ANGLE on Maisie's pie. Several pieces gone.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                And behind every shady deal, behind every dollar earned...</p>
              <p>TILT UP to Andy at the desk, munching thoughtfully as he totals 
                up figures on an adding machine.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                ...there was Andy, keeping the books.</p>
              <p>Andy finishes preparing two bank deposits. Norton hovers near 
                the desk, keeping a watchful eye.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Two deposits, Casco Bank and New England First. Night drop, like<br>
                always.</p>
              <p>Norton pockets the envelopes. Andy crosses to the wall safe and 
                shoves the ledger and sundry files inside. Norton locks the safe, 
                swings his wife's framed sampler back into place. He cocks his 
                thumb at some laundry and two suits in the corner.NORTON<br>
                Get my stuff down t'laundry. Two suits for dry-clean and a bag 
                of<br>
                whatnot. Tell 'em if they over- starch my shirts again, they're 
                gonna hear about it from me.<br>
                (adjusts his tie)<br>
                How do I look?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Very nice.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Big charity to-do up Portland way. Governor's gonna be there.<br>
                (indicates pie)<br>
                Want the rest of that? Woman can't bake worth shit.</p>
              <p>166 INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1965) 166</p>
              <p>Andy trudges down the corridor with Norton's laundry, the pie 
                box under his arm.</p>
              <p>167 INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 167</p>
              <p>TILT UP FROM PIE to find Red munching away as he helps Andy<br>
                sort books on the shelves.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                What you hear isn't half of it. He's got scams you haven't dreamed 
                of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks. There's a river of dirty money 
                flowing through this place.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Money like that can be a problem. Sooner or later you gotta explain<br>
                where it came from.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                That's where I come in. I channel it, funnel it, filter it...stocks, 
                securities, tax free municipals... I send that money out into 
                the big<br>
                world. And when it comes back...</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                It's clean as a virgin's whistle?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Cleaner. By the time Norton retires, I will have made him a millionaire.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Jesus. They ever catch on, he's gonna wind up wearing a number 
                himself.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                I thought you had more faith in me than that.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                I'm sure you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail. Anybody 
                gets<br>
                too curious -- FBI, IRS, whatever -- that trail's gonna lead to 
                somebody.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Sure it will. But not to me, and certainly not to the warden.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Who then?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Peter Stevens.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Who?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                The silent, silent partner. He's the guilty one, your Honor. The 
                man<br>
                with the bank accounts. That's where the filtering process starts. 
                They trace it back, all they're gonna find is him.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Yeah, okay, but who the hell is he?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                A phantom. An apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.<br>
                (off Red's look)<br>
                I conjured him out of thin air. He doesn't exist...except on paper.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                You can't just make a person up.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Sure you can, if you know how the system works, and where the 
                cracks are. It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail. Mr. 
                Stevens has a birth certificate, social security card, driver's 
                license.<br>
                They ever track those accounts, they'll wind up chasing a figment<br>
                of my imagination.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Jesus. Did I say you were good? You're Rembrandt.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                It's funny. On the outside, I was an honest man. Straight as an 
                arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook.</p>
              <p>168 EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DUSK (1965)</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Does it ever bother you?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I don't run the scams, Red, I just process the profits. That's 
                a fine<br>
                line, maybe. But I've also built that library, and used it to 
                help a dozen guys get their high school diplomas. Why do you think 
                the warden lets me do all that?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                To keep you happy and doing the laundry. Money instead of sheets.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I work cheap. That's the trade-off.</p>
              <p>TWO SIREN BLASTS draw their attention to the main gate. It swings 
                open, revealing a prison bus waiting outside.</p>
              <p>169 INT -- PRISON BUS -- DUSK (1965) 169</p>
              <p>Among those on board is TOMMY WILLIAMS, a damn good-looking kid 
                in his mid-20's. The bus RUMBLES through the gate.</p>
              <p>170 EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DUSK (1965) 170</p>
              <p>The new fish disembark, chained together single-file. The old-timers 
                holler and shake the fence. A deafening gauntlet.</p>
              <p>171 INT -- CELLBLOCK EIGHT -- NIGHT (1965) 171</p>
              <p>Tommy and the others are marched in naked and shivering, covered 
                with delousing powder, greeted by TAUNTS and JEERS.</p>
              <p>172 INT -- TOMMY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1965) 172</p>
              <p>The bars slam with a STEEL CLANG. Tommy and his new CELLMATE 
                take in their new surroundings.</p>
              <p>TOMMY<br>
                Well. Ain't this for shit?</p>

              <p>DOLLYING Tommy as he struts along, combing his ducktail,<br>
                cigarette behind his ear. (We definitely need The Coasters or 
                Del Vikings on the soundtrack here. Maybe Jerry Lee Lewis.)</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965 on a two year stretch 
                for B&amp;E. Cops caught him sneakin' TV sets out the back door 
                of a JC Penney.</p>
              <p>174 INT -- WOOD SHOP -- DAY (1965) 174</p>
              <p>A SHRIEKING BUZZSAW slices ten-foot lengths of wood. Red runs 
                the machine while some other OLD-TIMERS feed the wood.</p>

                Young punk, Mr. Rock n' Roll, cocky as hell...</p>
              <p>Tommy is hauling the cut wood off the conveyor and stacking it,<br>
                It's a ball-busting job, but the kid's a blur.</p>

                C'mon there, old boys! Movin' like molasses! Makin' me look bad!</p>
              <p>The old guys just grin and shake their heads.</p>

                ...so I'm backin' out the door, right? Had the TV like this...<br>
                (mimes his grip)<br>
                Big ol' thing. Couldn't see shit. Suddenly, here's this voice:<br>
                &quot;Freeze kid! Hands in the air!&quot;<br>
                Well I just stand there holdin' on to that TV, so the voice says: 
                &quot;You<br>
                hear what I said, boy?&quot; And I say, &quot;Yes sir, I sure 
                did! But if I drop<br>
                this fuckin' thing, you got me on destruction of property too!&quot;</p>
              <p>The whole table falls about laughing.</p>

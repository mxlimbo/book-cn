            <p></p>
            <p>INT. - The Egan house --- </p>
            <p><br>
              Missy - <br>
              Phone's over there. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Oh thanks. Jody, will you call triple A? </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              You got it, Angela. </p>
            <p>Helen turns to go to the telephone and her face walks into a black 
              fishing slicker and she screams. Julie just laughs to not look suspicious. 
              Helen composses herself and goes to the phone. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              My name's Missy Egan. Are you girls from Mirable? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              No, Southport. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Oh I went to Southport High. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah I knew you looked fimiliar, what year? </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Ah class of '88. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Your name, Egan, it sounds very fimiliar, do you have a brother 
              or something? </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              I did but he was younger than me, David, younger. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              What class was he? </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Ah '92 but he's dead, he died last july. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I'm so sorry. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Thanks. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Do you ah, do you live alone? </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Yeah, ah well my daddy died a long time ago and my mama she's in 
              a home you know in Aurora because she didn't take, take too well 
              to what happened with David. Things just haven't been the same since 
              he died. </p>
            <p>A long pause and then Helen walks over after her phone call. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              They're on their way. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              I could make you guys a cup of tea while you're waiting. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Thanks. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah thanks, that's nice of you. </p>
            <p>Missy smiles and walks into the kitchen. Helen and Julie are looking 
              at pictures of David and Missy in happier times. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              You know I think I remember David, he had a friend right? what was 
              his name? </p>
            <p>Missy (from the kitchen) - <br>
              Who? </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Didn't he hang out with this guy, I mean they were really close, 
              god what was his name. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Oh, I don't know, I didn't know too many of Davids friends </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Oh </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              But there, there was one guy, one guy, he stopped by not too long 
              after Davids death and and he came to pay his respects. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Really?? </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Oh, yeah he was a really nice guy, he was cute and smart. And well 
              we were sweet on each other for about two minutes, but it didn't 
              work out you know. He never really said it but I think it hurt him 
              to be around me. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Where is this old friend now? </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Oh I don't know. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Do you remember his name? </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Billy. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Did he have a last name? </p>
            <p>Missy is looking up remembering her time with Billy Blue. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Blue...Billy Blue </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Well you know what? We should probably wait back at the car. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              No don't be ridiculous, why don't... ah stay. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              No, I don't want to miss triple A. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              We apreciate the phone. </p>
            <p>The begin to leave, Missy yells as they are leaving... </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Anytime you know, I don't get too many knocks on my door nowadays. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT.- Julies Car --- They have just left Missys house and Julie 
              is upset. </p>
            <p><br>
              Helen - <br>
              You okay? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I wigged out I'm sorry. But being in his house and seeing his sister. 
              God do you see what we've done? </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              It was an accident. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Helen we killed a man and then ruined the lives of everyone he knew. 
            </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              I don't think we're that powerful Julie, You're giving us way too 
              much credit. </p>
            <p>Missy runs up along side of the car and pounds on the window making 
              Julie and Helen jump. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Hey! You forgot your cigarettes. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Thank you. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Well I see you got this car started didn't ya? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah damndest thing, it started right up. </p>
            <p>Missy - <br>
              Funny how that happens. </p>
            <p>Julie drives away as Missy is still talking leaving Missy with 
              a sinister look on her face. </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - Helens house --- Julie and Helen are in the car still, Julie 
              is dropping Helen off. </p>
            <p><br>
              Helen - <br>
              So what now? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Now we try and locate this Billy Blue. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Maybe he wanted to die. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              What? </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              David Egan. His girlfriend was killed on that same road july 4th 
              one year earlier,. Maybe he blammed himself, maybe he was sitting 
              in the road waiting for us to hit him. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah if that'll help you sleep at night. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              What happened between us? We used to be best friends. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              We used to be a lot of things. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              I miss you. </p>
            <p>No response from Julie. Helen sees that the feeling isn't mutual. 
            </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Yeah. Well. </p>
            <p>She gets out of the car and Julie drives away without saying a 
              word. </p>
            <p>INT. - Helens house - Helen walks into the living room and sees 
              her father sitting watching TV. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Hey Dad. </p>
            <p>Her father is too wrapped up in the ball game to notice his daughter. 
              She walks into the kitchen and pours a glass of diet coke while 
              the killer is sneaking in the front door and working his way up 
              the stairs. Helen finishes her drink and goes up to her bedrooom 
              just in time to miss seeing who just went up before her. <br>
              She gets to her room but no one is there. She changes into her night 
              clothes and looks at the crown that she will have to give back the 
              next day. Suddenly a hand is moving towards her and touches her 
              on the arm, she jumps and turns around, it's Elsa. </p>
            <p>Elsa - <br>
              Hey is the washed up, dried out, has-been having a moment? </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              What do you want? </p>
            <p>Elsa - <br>
              We're doing inventory at the store tomorrow and I need you there 
              by ten. </p>
            <p>Helen sits on her bed brushing her hair. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              I can't, I'm in the parade tomorrow. </p>
            <p>Elsa - <br>
              Well dad put me in charge of the store and I want you there by ten. 
            </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              The outgoing queen has to ride in the parade prior to the padgent, 
              it's <br>
              tradition, there's nothing I can do about it. </p>
            <p>Elsa - <br>
              You and your hair, it's so pathetic. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              You can leave now. </p>
            <p>Elsa - <br>
              So very pathetic... </p>
            <p>she says while shutting the door. Helen gets in bed and shuts the 
              lights out. </p>
            <p><br>
              INT. - Helens bedroom --- Helen is just waking up. She feels her 
              crown on her head and begins to take it off, bunches of her hair 
              come off with it. She starts to freak out and runs to the mirror 
              and sees the word &quot;SOON&quot; written in bold letters on it 
              and she screams loudly and smashes the mirror. </p>
            <p><br>
              INT. - Julies house --- Julie picks up a ringing telephone. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Hello? </p>
            <p>short pause. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Oh my god. </p>
            <p>She runs out of the house and jumops in her car and takes off. 
              In the car she hears a noise coming from the back seat, there is 
              nothing there, she stops the car and opens the trunk and sees the 
              rotting corpse of Max being eaten by crabs, he is wearing Barrys 
              jacket. She screams and slams the trunk thinking what to do and 
              then takes off running. </p>
            <p><br>
              INT. - Helens bedroom --- Barry is comforting Helen after her hellish 
              ordeal. <br>
              Julie runs in the room. </p>

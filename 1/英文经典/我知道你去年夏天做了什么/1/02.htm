            <p>INT. Barry's car. --- Ray is driving, Julie is in the passanger 
              seat and Barry and Helen are in the back seat making out. The car 
              shifts and Barry sits up. </p>
            <p><br>
              Barry - You can't drive for shit you know that? </p>
            <p>Julie (to Barry) - <br>
              Can you say Al-co-hol-ic??? </p>
            <p>Sappy music is playing on the radio. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              What the hell is this crap? </p>
            <p>Barry then puts on some thrash music and climbs out the sunroof 
              while swilling back the booze and screaming. Barry then drops his 
              bottle on Ray and the car starts to slide. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              You asshole. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              What's wrong with you? </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              WATCH OUT!!!!!!! </p>
            <p>The car hits something hard and skids off the road. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              What was that? </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              I don't know. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Is everybody okay? </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Yeah </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Maybe it was an animal </p>
            <p>Barry comes down through the sunroof. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Oh my god you're bleeding. </p>
            <p>Barry wipes the blood of his face. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              It's not mine. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              It must have been a dog or something. </p>
            <p>Barry (screaming) - <br>
              Jesus Christ, my fuckin' car. </p>
            <p>They all hop out and look at the smashed up car. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Fuck! Can't you see where you're going?? </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Look, it came out of nowhere, I didn't see it. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              A dog couldn't have done that. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Yeah well a fucking deer could. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              You dropped your bottle, I was just... </p>
            <p>Barry (interupting) - <br>
              My dad is gonna freak on my ass. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              It was an accident leave him alone. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Where is it? If it was a deer then where is it?? </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Maybe it ran off. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              I hope so, I hope we didn't kill it. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Fuck that. Lets go. </p>
            <p>Julie sees a mans boot on the side on the road with blood on it. 
            </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Oh my god. </p>
            <p>She runs and picks it up. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              No way. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Oh my god. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              But I thought... </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              I didn't see it. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              No there's no way. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Oh my god this isn't happening. </p>
            <p>Barry runs and gets some flashlights out of the trunk of the car. 
              They begin looking. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              You check that side. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Yeah. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Come on Helen. </p>
            <p>Julie screams in horror, there is a body laying on the side of 
              the road. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              I couldn't see him, I swear. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Is he dead.? </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              I don't know </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Check his pulse. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              No way </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              You're the one who rammed him. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Just do it. </p>
            <p>Ray goes towards the body and checks his pulse. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>

            <p>Barry - <br>

            <p>Ray - I can't tell, his face is all messed up. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              What the hell was he doing out here? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              We've got to call the police and get an ambulance out here. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Hey hey what's your hurry? The guys dead. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              You're not a doctor you don't make that descison. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Use your brain Julie, we call the police and were fucked. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              It was an accident. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Look, lets think about this a minute. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Think about what? Think about what? He was crossing the road in 
              the middle of the night okay it was an accident, you weren't drinking 
              or speeding. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              There's liquor all over the car. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              But you're sober. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              They will never believe I was driving. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              It's my car, they'll nail my ass. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              That's not true. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Are you kidding? Look at me, I'm drunk as shit, I'm fucked. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              So we'll call the police, just tell them the truth, they'll believe 
              us. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              It's manslaughter. We're gonna fry no matter who takes the fall. 
            </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Then we leave right now. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              No way are you crazy? </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              The grills busted, there's blood everywhere. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              We can clean it up, come on. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Listen to yourselves, NO we are going to the police. </p>
            <p>Barry (still screaming) - <br>
              We don't have time for your shit, you understand? we've got to move 
              fast. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Hey, now lets try to stay calm. Focus. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Don't you get it? If there's some of him on the car, there's some 
              of the car on him, their gonna trace it back to you, you're looking 
              at a hit and run. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Then we dump the body. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              You've lost it. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Like just pretend we were never here. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              We could drag him into the water and dump him in, they wouldn't 
              find the fucker for weeks by that time all the evidence would be 
              washed away. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              If they found him at all... The currents are strong, the undertow 
              could carry him out to sea. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I won't be any part of it. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Look I'm scared Julie, I'm not like the rest of you, I don't have 
              the family or the money to get me out of this. Please. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              This is your future Julie, think about it, college, your schloarship. 
              The guy's already dead, if we go to the police we're dead too. </p>
            <p>A truck starts coming down the road towards them. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Fuck. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              What do we do? </p>
            <p>Barry (to Ray) - <br>
              Help me. </p>
            <p>Barry and Ray pick up the body and carry him over to the other 
              side of the guardrail. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Shit, they're slowing down. Who is it? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              It's Max. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Get rid of him. </p>
            <p>Max stops the truck. </p>
            <p>Max - <br>
              Julie? What you got car trouble? </p>
            <p>Max and Julie look over to the guardrail where Barry is pretedning 
              he is vomiting. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Actually, it's barry, he's had way too much to drink and were trying 
              to keep the up-chuck out of the new car. </p>
            <p>Max looks back at the smashed up car. </p>
            <p>Max - <br>
              Doesn't look so new anymore </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah, don't drink and drive. </p>
            <p>Max - <br>
              Daddy's gonna be mad. </p>
            <p>Ray comes over to the truck. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              What can I do for you Max? </p>
            <p>Max - <br>
              You can wipe that &quot;my shit don't stink grin off your face&quot;. 
            </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Okay Max, will do. Have a goodnight. </p>
            <p>Max - <br>
              You almost got that rich boy act down Ray. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              We'll be seeing you Max. </p>
            <p>Max - <br>
              Yup. Take care Julie. </p>
            <p>Max drives away. </p>

            <p></p>
            <p>EXT. Down at the docks. --- Barrys car is arriving, they get out 
              and open the <br>
              trunk and Barry and Ray start dragging the body down to the water. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              Barry - <br>
              Even if his body washes ashore in the next couple of weeks, he'll 
              be eaten by <br>
              crabs and small fish. Maybe we'll get lucky with a shark. Take him 
              to the side. </p>
            <p>they start to lower him on to the side of the wharf. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Put him down. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Easy, that's it. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Lets do it. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Wait. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              What? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Should we check his wallet and see who he is? </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Why? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I don't know okay, just to know. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              I don't want to know. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Let's just pretend he's some escaped lunatic with a hook for a hand 
              and we're <br>
              doing everybody a favor. Ray help me. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              I don't think I can Barry. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Shit, we agreed </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              God, come on Barry it's not too late. </p>
            <p>Barry (screaming) - <br>
              You, shut up just shut up. </p>
            <p>Helen (wanting to get it over with) - <br>
              Christ already I'll do it. </p>
            <p>Helen and Barry start to move the body towards the water when all 
              of the sudden <br>
              the man wakes up and grabs Helens crown, they all scream and push 
              him in the <br>
              water. </p>
            <p>Helen (Hystrical) - <br>
              My crown, he's got my crown. </p>
            <p>Barry jumps in the water after the crown and swims to the bottom 
              where the man <br>
              has landed with the crown in his hand. Barry reaches for it and 
              as his hands <br>
              touches the crown the mans eyes pop open and Barry beats the crown 
              away from him <br>
              while screaming his head off and swims back to the top leaving the 
              man <br>
              underwater. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Over here. </p>
            <p>Barry slams the crown to Helen and walks towards the car. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Let's get out of here. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              We're going home now and never, ever, under any circumstances known 
              to God speak <br>
              about this again is that clear? It is now mearly a futural therapy 
              bill agreed? </p>
            <p>Barry (Screaming) - <br>
              Helen?? </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              I'll never mention it again. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              We make a pact, right here and now we take this to our grave. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Agreed. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Julie? </p>
            <p>Julie nods her head in agreement. </p>
            <p>Barry (livid) - <br>
              Don't you nod your head you fuckin say it. </p>
            <p>Julie (somber) - <br>
              Yeah okay. </p>
            <p>Barry runs and grabs Julie by the neck pushing her against the 
              car. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              We take this to our grave, let me hear it. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Let her go Barry. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              you fucking say it! </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Okay Barry, we take this to the grave. </p>
            <p>Barry gets in the car wet and furious. </p>
            <p>Ray (to Julie) - <br>
              It will be okay. </p>
            <p>Julie begins to cry. And they all get in the car and leave. Camera 
              pans in on <br>
              the ground where a silver medallion that says &quot;I love you&quot; 
              is laying. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>ONE YEAR LATER</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. Julies college. --- Students are running around on campus. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              INT. Julies dormroom. --- Julies roommate Deb walks in. </p>
            <p><br>
              Deb - <br>
              Yo, it's time to go. </p>
            <p>Julie turns around from her computer revealing that the last year 
              has sure taken <br>
              its toll on her. </p>
            <p>Deb - <br>
              Come on, move your tired ugly ass girl we're late. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I changed my mind, I'm not going. </p>
            <p>Deb - <br>
              Julie, get your white as death, chalky corpse in the car now. </p>
            <p>Pause. </p>
            <p>Deb - <br>
              I said come on. Julie you're going home for the summer and you're 
              going to get a <br>
              tan on that pasty pale tail of yours. </p>
            <p>They both giggle. </p>
            <p>Deb - <br>
              Let's go. </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - Julies house - Deb is pulling the car into the driveway. 
              Julie takes her <br>
              bag from the backseat. </p>
            <p><br>
              Deb - <br>
              Remember, sun and fun. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah. </p>
            <p>Deb drives off leaving Julie home, where she doesn't want to be. 
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. James - <br>
              Julie? Welcome home dear. </p>
            <p>Julie turns around to see her mother who she hasn't seen since 
              last summer. </p>
            <p>Mrs. James - <br>
              I missed you. </p>
            <p><br>
              INT. - Julies Kitchen - Julie and her mother are eating. </p>
            <p><br>
              Mrs. James - <br>
              How's the snapper? </p>
            <p>Julie just fakes a smile. </p>
            <p>Mrs. James - <br>
              I really wanted monkfish but it's been a bad season. </p>
            <p>Julie sits stonefaced. </p>
            <p>Mrs- James - <br>
              Are you on drugs? </p>
            <p>Julie is surprised by the question. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              What? </p>
            <p>Mrs. James - <br>
              I just wanted to surprise you, I want an honest reaction. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              No. No mom no drugs. </p>
            <p>Mrs. James - <br>
              Well than what is wrong? I mean you look like death. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah well I've had a rough year. </p>
            <p>Julies mom clears the table and Julie gets up and walks towards 
              the living room <br>
              looking at old awards and pictures of her father. Julies mother 
              walks in. </p>
            <p>Mrs. James - <br>
              You got some mail, a letter came today, not your report card though, 
              that came <br>
              last week. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Mom I know it looks bad but the summer session went really well. 
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. James - <br>
              Well it would have to because acording to the dean you only have 
              one more <br>
              chance. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              It's not that serious really. </p>
            <p>Mrs. James - <br>
              What happened to my daughter? I mean you went away and you don't 
              call and you <br>
              don't visit. </p>
            <p>Mrs. James begins to walk out of the room. </p>
            <p>Mrs. James - <br>
              Your father must be turning over in his grave. </p>
            <p>Julie begins to cry as she opens the plainly marked envelope so 
              see the words <br>
              written boldy in black marker &quot;I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER&quot; 
              she looks at it <br>
              terrified as she begins to cry harder. </p>
            <p>Julie (Holding back the tears) - <br>
              Who sent this? There's no postmark or return address. </p>
            <p>Mrs. James - <br>
              Your guess is as good as mine why what does it say? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Nothing. </p>
            <p>Julie runs up the stairs to her bedroom. She sits on a sofa looking 
              at the <br>
              letter all night long wondering who <br>
              could have sent it. She hears a noise outside and runs to shut her 
              window and <br>
              curtains. She is scared. </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - The streets of southport --- Julies car drives up to the 
              store named <br>
              Shivers. </p>
            <p><br>
              INT. - Shivers --- Back entrance Elsa is talking to some guys unloading 
              <br>
              merchandise. A man drops one of the boxes. </p>
            <p><br>
              Elsa - <br>
              Guys, easy. It's called glass, it breaks. </p>
            <p>She walks into the main part of the store greeting some shoppers 
              and begins to <br>
              arrange some things. Julie walks into the store. </p>
            <p>Elsa - <br>
              Well well look what the cat drug in. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Elsa, hi. You know what? I need to talk to Helen and I was wondering 
              if you <br>
              could give me her New York number? </p>
            <p>Elsa - <br>
              Her New York number? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah I need to talk to her. </p>
            <p>Elsa - <br>
              Fact check Julie, Helen doesn't have a New York number, if you need 
              to speak to <br>
              her I suggest you go to womens fragrances, 10 feet to your left. 
            </p>
            <p>Camera pans off to show Helen who is arranging some bottles of 
              perfume. </p>
            <p>Elsa - <br>
              Frightning isn't it? </p>
            <p>Helen looks up and sees the friend that she hasn't seen in a year 
              and smiles. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Julie? </p>
            <p>Julie walks over to her. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              When did you get home? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yesterday. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              It's good to see you. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              What happened to New York. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              I went for a while and it didn't really work out. </p>
            <p>Julie pulls the letter from her pocket. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Somebody sent this to me. </p>
            <p>A look of fear crosses Helens face. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Oh my God. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Somebody knows Helen. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              How? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I don't know. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Julie we were so carefull. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Were we? Were we? What if somebody saw us? What if somebody else 
              was there that <br>
              night? </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Who? It's been a year. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I don't know. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Has Barry seen this? </p>

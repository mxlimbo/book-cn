              getting ready for the event. Barry and Helen are backstage, she 
              is upset at having just seen the killer. Barry is trying to comfort 
              her. </p>
            <p><br>
              Barry - <br>
              Stay calm. I'll be up in the balcony. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              He had a hook Barry. I saw it, it was a big huge hook. </p>
            <p>Barry - <br>
              Everything's gonna be alright. I'm not gonna let anything happen 
              to you. </p>
            <p>Cut to --- A little while later --- The contest has started. Everyone 
              is on stage. </p>

              Very nicley done ladies. And now let's meet last years winner, Miss 
              Helen Shivers. </p>
            <p>Helen walks out to a cheering crowd, she looks up in the balcony 
              focusing on Barry. A girl is very horribly singing a very horrible 
              song. Helen laughs and looks up at Barry who is also laughing. She 
              looks back at the girl then back up at Barry to see the killer coming 
              up behind him and pulls him back. Helen goes crazy, she starts screaming 
              and running towards the balcony but the crowd is in <br>
              an uproar and she can't get through. A cop stops her. And the killer 
              is slashing Barry to death with his hook. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              HELP HIM. PLEASE. BARRY!!! </p>
            <p>Cop - <br>
              Excuse me. What's the problem?? </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Help him he's gonna kill him. </p>
            <p>Cop - <br>
              Who's killing who? </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Up in the balcony. </p>
            <p>Cop - <br>
              Okay everybody stay calm. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Get off of me! </p>
            <p>There is a lot of commotion going on and everyone is talking over 
              each other. <br>
              Helen follows the cop up into the balcony. </p>
            <p>Cop - <br>
              Mame stay behind me okay? </p>
            <p>They look around but find no one or no trace that anyone had ever 
              been there. </p>
            <p>Cop - <br>
              There's nobody up here. I gotta tell ya, this is really not my idea 
              of a funny joke. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              He was here. </p>
            <p>Cop - <br>
              Who? Who was here? </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              The fisherman, he killed Barry. </p>
            <p>Cop - <br>
              Barry who? Who are we talking about? There's nobody up here, come 
              on let's go back downstairs, come one, come on, there's nobody up 
              here. </p>
            <p>As they are walking dowstairs they don't see the blood dripping 
              from the edge of the balcony. </p>
            <p>After the Croaker queen contest Helen is still sitting there looking 
              at the floor. Almost everyone has left, the cop comes up to her. 
            </p>
            <p>Cop - <br>
              Mame, I'm gonna take you home, your parents are really worried about 
              you. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              You have to believe me. </p>
            <p>Cop - <br>
              Why don't you let me take you home okay? </p>
            <p>She gets up to leave with him and the MC grabs at her crown. </p>
            <p>MC - <br>
              Excuse me, we'll be needing this. </p>

            <p>Helen - <br>

            <p>Cop - <br>
              Did this fisherman guy use the same hook to cut all your hair off? 
            </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              No, he used scissors asshole. Look, okay I know I sound delusional 
              but it's true. </p>
            <p>Cop - <br>
              Yeah I've heard this story before except the way I heard it it wasn't 
              a <br>
              fisherman, it was an escaped mental patient and he had a hook for 
              a hand. We're gonna have to take the alley. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Look, you little shitstick mayberry ass regect, there's been a murder 
              and you're gonna fry in hell if you ignore it. </p>

              Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do, okay I'll contact Barry's parents 
              and put out a search for him alright? He was probably just playing 
              a prank on you. </p>
            <p>The cop sees a man standing under the hood of his car. </p>
            <p>Cop - <br>
              Oh jesus, listen I'm just gonna be a minute alright, I'm gonna see 
              if this guy needs help. </p>
            <p>He gets out of the car and walks over to the man. Helen can tell 
              who it is. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              That's him. </p>
            <p>Cop - <br>
              What's the trouble? </p>
            <p>Helen starts yelling to the cop. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              That's him, behind you, BEHIND YOU! </p>
            <p>The cops turns back to the man who then sticks his hook in the 
              cops stomach, bloods runs from the cops mouth. Helen screams, she 
              tries to get out but she is in the back which is locked from the 
              outside, the killer starts coming towards the car, she kicks the 
              glass out of the window and crawls out and starts running, he is 
              following her. </p>
            <p><br>
              INT. - Julies House --- Julie is still looking at articles about 
              Susie Willis on the internet. She is reading outloud. </p>

              Susie Willis killed, trapped in car, driver unharmed, survived by 
              her father, Benjamin, a local fisherman. </p>
            <p>With that, Julie runs out the door. </p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. - On the streets --- the killer is still chasing Helen, she 
              see the store that her family owns, Elsa is inside closing up for 
              the night. Helen runs towards the store screaming for Elsa. </p>
            <p><br>
              Helen - <br>
              ELSA, ELSA, OPEN THE DOOR, ELSA, OPEN THE DOOR, PLEASE, JESUS CHRIST 
              HURRY. </p>
            <p>Elsa is slow in getting to the door, she finishes putting plastic 
              over some items and then goes to get the keys. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              ELSA WHAT ARE YOU GOING? ELSA, PLEASE, OPEN THE DOOR, JESUS CHRIST 
              NOW! </p>
            <p>Elsa - <br>
              I'm coming </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              ELSA, ELSA, PLEASE. </p>
            <p>Elsa finally opens the door, Helen runs in and slams the door behind 
              her. </p>
            <p>Elsa - <br>
              You could have walked around the Arch Tree entrance it's open. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              I'm being attacked. </p>
            <p>Elsa - <br>
              You're what? </p>
            <p>They look outside and see no one. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Lock the other door, I'll call the police. </p>
            <p>Elsa - <br>
              What is going on? </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Just do what I say god dammit. </p>
            <p>Helen runs upstairs to use the phone, Elsa goes to the back entrance 
              to lock the door. The door is swinging shut just before she walks 
              in, she begins to lock it when she sees a reflection in the door, 
              she turns around to see the man in a slicker standing looking at 
              her with his face covered, she can't move or speak. His reflection 
              passes through her glasses and she screams as the large hook slashes 
              her throat. Helen hears the scream and hangs up the phone slowly 
              moving down the stairs. </p>
            <p>Helen - <br>
              Elsa? Elsa? Elsa where are you? </p>
            <p>No response, she gets paranoid and tunrs around looking closley 
              at a mannequin that is covered in plastic, it is very silent then 
              all of the sudden he jumps out from under the plastic and tackles 
              her to the ground, she escapes and runs up the stairs, she passes 
              by the bathroom and sees Elsa dead laying on the floor, she screams 
              and keeps running and hops onto an old hand operated elevator, the 
              killer is following her, she gets on the elevator and starts pulling 
              the rope, he can't get on it but he swings his hook at her legs, 
              she finally gets up to the attic and the killer has used the stairs 
              and is also up there, she runs over to the edge of a window, he 
              comes for her, she jumps out landing in a dumpster full of wood 
              and other garbage. In a daze she looks up to the window and sees 
              the killer is gone. She takes off running down the street, through 
              alleys to try and find someone who can help her, fireworks go off 
              and she sees that the parade is still going on, she runs towards 
              them and hears a noise, she turns around and there is nothing, she 
              turns back towards the parade, the killer is standing behind her, 
              he grabs her and throws her into a stack of <br>
              tires and he slashes her to death. </p>
            <p><br>

              the boat Ray works on, she runs towards the boat. </p>
            <p><br>
              Julie - <br>
              Ray? Ray ? Ray? </p>
            <p>Rays head pops up from below the boat. </p>
            <p>Ray- <br>
              Julie, what are you doing here? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              We didn't kill David Egan, it was someone else on the road that 
              night. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              What are you talking about? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              I think it was Susies father, Ben Willis, he's a fisherman. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              But they found Davids body in the water. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah I know but I think Ben Willis killed David Egan. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Wait a second. You think this Willis guy killed David then we killed 
              him? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Yeah but what if he didn't die Ray? What if he's still alive? </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              This is crazy. Come aboard. Come inside. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              No we've gotta find Helen and Barry. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              We will, we will. </p>
            <p>He holds out his hand and she reaches for it and sees the name 
              of his boat is &quot;Billy Blue&quot;. She pulls her hand back. 
            </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              You. Oh my god it's you. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              What are you talking about? </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Billy Blue. You went to Missys, your, your the friend, your the 
              fisherman. </p>
            <p>She runs faster than she has ever ran in her life, Ray yells behind 
              her. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              I can explain...Julie wait, Julie. </p>
            <p>He is running in back of her, she runs into a locked door. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Shit. </p>
            <p>Ray - <br>
              Wait. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Stop it. </p>
            <p>He keeps chasing her when all of the sudden an man sticks his arm 
              out sending Ray to the ground. Julie screams. </p>
            <p>Julie - <br>
              Oh, oh please help me please. </p>
            <p>Man - <br>

            <p>Ray starts to get up. </p>
            <p>Man - <br>
              On the boat, inside, hurry. </p>
            <p>She runs onto the boat, the man leaves Ray on the ground and walks 
              onto the boat too, he removes the anchor. Julie looks around and 
              sees pictures of herslef and her three friends all over the place.

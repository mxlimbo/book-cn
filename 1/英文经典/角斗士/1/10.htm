                NARCISSUS<br>
                I don't have a birth sign...</p>
              <p>Cos looks to Proximo who starts to speak but realizes the interview 
                is over...</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. NARCISSUS' CELL - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
              <p>Narcissus crouches in the corner slowly sipping his wine<br>
                staring at the 'faces' of his ancestors.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Janus, God of passages, I know you<br>
                exist...<br>
                (pause)<br>
                I beg you open the door for Selene, Manto, and my little Themis 
                to the land of our ancestors. I have no fit offering for the task 
                I ask, but<br>
                if you save my ladies one day I will find a sacrifice worthy of 
                you.</p>
              <p>Dala's face peers in from above.</p>
              <p> DALA<br>
                Don't let Proximo push you around.<br>
                Proximo must, by law, give you a third of everything he makes 
                off you outside the arena. Popular gladiators get rich!</p>
              <p>Narcissus grabs his wine jug and throws it at Dala who leaps 
                out of sight. Then Narcissus picks up a stone and stands over 
                the images of his ancestors.</p>
              <p>ON HIS ANCESTORS...</p>
              <p>One by one he SMASHES EACH FACE. SOUNDS OF THE COLOSSEUM<br>
                RISE OVER as if cheering him on...</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. COLOSSEUM - GLADIATOR AREA - MORNING</p>
              <p>A SWORD drops in the dirt. Narcissus looks up to find<br>
                Proximo with an Arena Slave who holds a sack of swords.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                We're calling you &quot;Narcissus The Good.&quot; It's in the 
                Daily Action.</p>
              <p>A CHEER from the crowd and Narcissus glances toward the<br>
                arena.</p>
              <p>HE SEES...</p>
              <p>Crassus has speared a panther which drops, clawing hopelessly 
                at the blade stuck in its throat. To resounding cheers, Crassus 
                holds up his arms, playing to his audience. Then with a huge show 
                he straddles the cat and kills it with a dagger -- the crowd erupts...</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>picks the sword up so fast the point almost catches Proximo in 
                the face. Proximo straightens, scowls and moves off. Bad Teeth 
                chuckles. But when he gets the cold stare from Narcissus he turns 
                away, chuckling to himself.</p>
              <p>ARENA</p>
              <p>Narcissus faces a Hoplomachi. The Hoplomachi looks completely 
                protected in lead grey armor. He carries a round shield and a 
                long sword. Narcissus walks slowly toward him and the audience 
                hushes.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Surrender or I'll kill you!</p>
              <p>People just crack-up...</p>
              <p> SPECTATOR<br>
                Narcissus The Good!</p>
              <p>As one the audience howls throwing trash down into the<br>
                arena.</p>
              <p>Narcissus drops his shield, grips his sword with both hands -- 
                feints -- the Hoplomachi misses left and Narcissus comes down 
                full force on the man's helmet.<br>
                Narcissus' sword SPLITS THE HELMET AND STAYS THERE. The Hoplomachi 
                takes two more steps and drops dead.</p>
              <p>Narcissus turns and strides back the way he came ignoring<br>
                the crowd as it GOES WILD.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. GLADIATOR WAGON - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
              <p>Narcissus sits rubbing his wrist where he's cuffed. The others 
                watching him. Crassus hands him a small jar and a rag. Narcissus 
                wipes his wrist -- and it stings. Bad Teeth chuckles. Now, heading 
                away from the Colosseum are Four Whores, today the Cute Whore 
                wears a BLUE WIG; they blow kisses...</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. FORUM - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
              <p>Outside the Senate Tribuus with ten Praetorian Guard face down 
                an angry demonstration.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. SENATE - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
              <p>Commodus faces the challenging, stoic wall of Senators in their 
                pure white togas. Falco sits prominently near the front. From 
                outside come the sounds of the mob.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Senators. There was no more fair man than my father. A man of<br>
                learning who dreamed the fondest of all Roman dreams: restoring 
                the<br>
                Republic. Still, my father ruled.<br>
                And though I seek only to fulfill his dream, I too must rule. 
                For<br>
                despite the gossip of philosophers men are not born free; they 
                must<br>
                have freedom given them by the state.</p>
              <p> GRACCHUS<br>
                Are you alleging, Caesar, that our citizens' desire for the Republic 
                is<br>
                infantile?</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Men who believe they can truly be free, like it or not, are necessarily 
                children.</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                And like children everywhere they scream &quot;freedom&quot; the 
                most when they<br>
                desire it least. I beg you, please continue, Caesar.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body 
                to<br>
                confirm my emperorship...</p>
              <p>Gracchus points out toward the street.</p>
              <p> GRACCHUS<br>
                We don't have to wait for the month of Janus, the people deny 
                you<br>
                already!</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                It is you, Gaius and you Gracchus who incite the people until 
                they are<br>
                out of control!</p>
              <p> GAIUS<br>
                It is not the Senate's duty to control the people, rather to allow<br>
                them the right to control us!</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                Gentlemen, gentlemen: our emperor has come here humbly to address 
                us about his confirmation...</p>
              <p> VOICE<br>
                If there is a confirmation!</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                ... and I insist we show him the respect and honor he is due.</p>
              <p> GRACCHUS<br>
                Caesar, what are you doing about this growing grain shortage? 
                If<br>
                there is unrest now, what happens when there is no bread at all?</p>
              <p> GAIUS<br>
                And that treaty! By giving the Germans money and letting them<br>
                remain on the Danube at arms do we not run the risk of essentially<br>
                financing their next invasion of Italy?</p>
              <p> GRACCHUS<br>
                Caesar, the Senate must answer to<br>
                the people...</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. SENATE - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
              <p>As Commodus comes out protected by a line of Praetorian Guard; 
                he's scared, but smiles like a politician.</p>
              <p> TRIBUUS<br>
                Make way! Make way for Caesar! Son of Marcus Aurelius!</p>
              <p> VOICE<br>
                To hell with the son! Give us back the father!</p>
              <p>The crowd breaks into a chant for Marcus Aurelius. As Commodus 
                and Tribuus move faster to get clear of the crowd people actually 
                begin THROWING TRASH.</p>

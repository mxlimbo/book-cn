                EXT. PALATINE HILL - PALACE - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Commodus looks out over Rome from the broad palace window.<br>
                Lucilla enters, dismisses her slaves. Commodus is fixed on the 
                only sound: voices of people WAILING.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Where have you been?</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Taking my pleasure. Do I need to clear my lovers with you?</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your 
                lovers.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother. The people have bread 
                and the city is quiet.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                What is that... wailing?</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                The fans of Narcissus. They were on vigil outside the school of 
                Proximo.<br>
                They believe he's dying.</p>
              <p>First time we've ever seen Commodus so pleased.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Now that is a happy sound!<br>
                Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena. 
                The<br>
                Gods know, I'm tired. Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                What are you talking about?</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                But I get what I want, always, don't I?</p>
              <p>He presses her against the wall and she shoves him back sinking 
                her nails into his face. But he pushes her down on her knees as 
                he twists her head back by her hair.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Thanks to you I've been studying up on all the great times of 
                my<br>
                predecessors in the Colosseum: Domitian had the daughters of<br>
                conquered kings raped to death by Chimpanzees -- Vespasian's<br>
                unfaithful mistress pulled apart by elephants; like they, I can 
                do<br>
                anything so long as the citizens -- that stinking mob -- approves.He 
                yanks her to her feet -- she struggles again but he<br>
                slams her against the marble wall, laughing.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Come now, surely I'm more handsome than a Rhinoceros or an elephant.</p>
              <p>Dazed, Lucilla allows Commodus to walk her toward his bedroom. 
                But he pauses by the window again to hear the cries. Then he yanks 
                her toward the bedroom.</p>
              <p> FADE TO:</p>
              <p>INT. FARM HOUSE - COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Manto and Themis on the rough floor by a blazing hearth as<br>
                Selene reads from the AENEID.</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                So clash their swords, and so their shields resound.<br>
                Jove sets the beam; in either scale he lays:<br>
                The champions' fate, and each exactly weighs.<br>
                On this side, life and lucky chance ascends;<br>
                Heavy with death, that other scale descends...</p>

                INT. COMMODUS BEDROOM - DAWN</p>
              <p>ON A PAINTING of leopards being captured for the circus.<br>
                It drifts like a dream over a bed where Commodus seems to<br>
                float in silk and linen. Lucilla lies asleep, face down<br>
                naked but partly buried in the silk. Distant CHEERS from<br>
                far below jar him AWAKE. Then Lucilla slowly wakes...</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. SCHOOL OF PROXIMO - DAWN</p>
              <p>On a terrace over-looking the streets Proximo and Cos flank and 
                support Narcissus.</p>
              <p>Clearly still in intense pain, he's determined to let the people 
                know he's alive. Proximo is a human grin.</p>
              <p>Narcissus surveys these faces, POOR PEOPLE mainly, common<br>
                WORKERS, probably UNEMPLOYED. Then he picks out the gang-<br>
                kids... all look to him as a hero. Beside them the Cute<br>
                Whore... wearing a purple wig. Narcissus raises his hand,<br>
                waves and they break into cheering.</p>
              <p>ON NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>Feeling something overwhelming as the breeze blows up from<br>
                the forum carrying the cheers of the crowd.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. GLADIATOR STORE HOUSE</p>
              <p>as Proximo and Cos watch Narcissus prowl through heaps of<br>
                armor looking for just the right 'effect'. He sets a gaudy silver 
                inlaid bronze helmet aside. </p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged 
                to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Lucky it didn't step on his head.</p>
              <p>Proximo and Cos swap looks. Narcissus comes up with a<br>
                battered but wildly designed lorica segmentata studded with cheap 
                gems and a SMILING SUN FACE of brass... he sets<br>
                it aside. Then from the junk and comes up with a PLUME...</p>
              <p> COS<br>
                So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor? What really<br>
                happened on the German front? You know the Senate's arguing your<br>
                case...</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                That's their job, isn't it? To argue. So, I think my case will 
                be<br>
                long on talk and short on action.</p>
              <p> COS<br>
                I am prepared to write anything you tell me.</p>
              <p>Narcissus goes back to sorting armor.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of<br>
                Janus.</p>
              <p> COS<br>
                The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!</p>
              <p>Narcissus allows himself a smirk; he knows what Cos really<br>
                wants to hear. Cos writes fast. Proximo looks from one<br>
                to the other a little confused.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates. He was 
                born on August thirty-first, you know.</p>
              <p> COS<br>
                That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little<br>
                girl! Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection 
                with Emperor Commodus?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting<br>
                booths will be doing good business. And, what was the name of 
                that olive oil company?</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Yes, of course, we'll go over everything -- but Cos has a wonderful 
                surprise! This is all over the city!</p>
              <p>Cos unrolls a copy of the Daily Action and proudly reads<br>
                his own words.</p>
              <p> COS (READING OVER)<br>
                &quot;Like Orpheus who ascends from death's clutches, Narcissus 
                The Good has thrown back hell's gate!&quot;</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. PALACE - PALATINE HILL - MORNING</p>
              <p>Commodus glares at a poster of Narcissus on the table as<br>
                Lucilla reads from the Daily Action. She takes enormous<br>
                pleasure in this.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                &quot;... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good<br>
                continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly<br>
                cast...&quot;</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Yes? Go on!</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                &quot;... by the emperor of Rome.<br>
                (pause)<br>
                This writer asks: between a Senate that debates truth until they 
                choke,<br>
                an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there 
                is<br>
                more virtue within the arena than without?&quot;</p>
              <p>Commodus looks like his head is going to explode...<br>
                SHOUTING VOICES RISE OVER...</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. COLOSSEUM ARENA - MORNING</p>
              <p>Narcissus messages his arm parading with the gladiators in<br>
                his gaudy armor shiny as the massive chrome bumpers of a<br>
                '59 Caddy, his wild plumed helmet under his arm. People<br>
                shout 'Narcissus!', and 'General!' He raises his arms<br>
                overhead like a super-hero -- accepting, encouraging and<br>
                getting the wild adulation of the crowd.</p>
              <p>Narcissus breaks away from the line of gladiators --<br>
                blowing kisses to the girls, absurdly striking muscle-man<br>
                poses -- and the crowd goes completely berserk --<br>
                Narcissus is their man and they chant his name over and<br>
                over.</p>
              <p>'TRENCHES'</p>
              <p>As Narcissus comes in from the arena Proximo gleefully<br>
                hands him a fresh poster.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                No more bad luck now! The people are anticipating you! I have<br>
                posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior<br>
                -- the true Roman! The man who fought side by side with the wolf 
                of<br>
                Rome!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. COLOSSEUM HALL</p>
              <p>Colosseum Slaves shove Narcissus and the other gladiators<br>
                against the walls as the double doors leading to the street swing 
                wide and a CHARIOT drawn by two WHITE HORSES THUNDER DOWN THE 
                HALL.</p>
              <p> DALA<br>
                It's Tiger! 'Tiger of Death!'</p>
              <p>THE ARENA</p>
              <p>The TIGER OF DEATH charges into the arena. At his side is<br>
                Commodus, hair and beard GLINTING WITH GOLD -- he wears a<br>
                loin-skin gladiator costume. Tiger races brutally forcing<br>
                the horses to 'skid' on their hind legs rodeo-style.</p>
              <p>Cos joins them, reads from the scroll handed him by the<br>
                Praetorian Guard.</p>
              <p> COS<br>
                &quot;Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the 
                Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence 
                before his beloved citizens.&quot; The Emperor's going to fight 
                in the arena. I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?</p>
              <p>To an eerie silence Commodus is escorted into the imperial box 
                by Guards. All eyes are on him in his invisible passage inside 
                the Colosseum -- catching up with him as he emerges into the imperial 
                box. Still that silence.</p>
              <p>Realizing the crowd is confused Commodus gestures toward<br>
                Tiger who immediately struts for the fans who now see<br>
                reason to CHEER.</p>
              <p>Dressed in gold and silver inlaid gladiator armor, Tiger<br>
                is fifty, but the guy looks terrific -- got muscles on<br>
                muscles. Maybe bald, he wears a gaudy flowing RED WIG.<br>
                His chariot is a tight-framed sport model, tough and<br>
                cutting-edge.</p>
              <p> DALA<br>
                This is the man! Tiger is the only living gladiator ever to win 
                the<br>
                Wooden Sword!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                What's the wooden sword?</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                A symbol of something no one ever gets to keep the gladiators 
                fighting hoping they'll get it anyway.<br>
                Freedom, is the wooden sword. If you perform extraordinary feats, 
                the Emperor can award you the wooden sword... and you're free.</p>
              <p>ARENA</p>
              <p>Tiger of Death waves the audience to silence. Then he turns and 
                bows deeply to Commodus.</p>
              <p> TIGER OF DEATH<br>
                My people! I have returned!<br>
                (deafening cheers)<br>
                How I have missed my glory days in this arena! And this is truly 
                the<br>
                most glorious day in the history of the Colosseum -- in the splendid<br>
                history of Rome! Caesar is to enter the arena as a gladiator! 
                At long<br>
                last an Emperor with enough guts to be one of us! Upon receiving 
                this news I raced here in my new chariot straight from Ostia -- 
                nonstop! It took me only four hours and these new wood and leather 
                wheel springs designed by my personal craftsmen smoothed out all 
                the ruts!</p>
              <p>A gush of 'OOOs' from the crowd. As Tiger shamelessly<br>
                flogs his vehicle, the retainer slowly walks it around the perimeter 
                of the Colosseum.(3)</p>
              <p> ADONIS<br>
                Caesar must have promised Tiger if he helped him he could flog 
                his<br>
                crappy chariots in the Colosseum</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>watches as the crowd reacts to the fabulous absolutely-<br>
                out-of-reach sport chariot. Some GASP. A WOMAN covers<br>
                her mouth and sobs...</p>

                of The<br>
                Lebanon with through-cut cream Manna Ash from Gaul -- The entirety 
                of this sublime structure is secured with Abyssinian Gilead Resins 
                and cold forged brazen pegs!</p>
              <p>A portly rich MAN in a toga the size of a tent -- and who couldn't 
                fit in the chariot if you used a twelve-foot shoehorn -- gestures 
                to Tiger.</p>
              <p> TOGA TENT<br>
                Tiger! Is it possible for mortals to acquire such a vehicle?</p>
              <p> TIGER OF DEATH<br>
                Mortals -- never! For like Phaethon, son of Helios, who could<br>
                not control his father's sun- chariot, the unskilled would<br>
                certainly crash! But I see you are a friend of Caesar you must 
                be no<br>
                mortal! I will take your order.</p>

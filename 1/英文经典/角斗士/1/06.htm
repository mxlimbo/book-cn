                PERSONAL GUARD<br>
                Sir, Caesar Commodus and Quintus Clarus to see you.\O</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Tell them to come in!</p>
              <p>Commodus and Quintus enter as the guard returns to his post. 
                Quintus sets his helmet down. He's wearing his lorica segmentata.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                Selene, girls.</p>
              <p>Commodus nods as Selene motions for the children to sit quietly.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                Marcus Aurelius has died.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                He left us at dawn.</p>
              <p>Everyone stunned. Selene embraces the children.<br>
                Narcissus slowly sits back at the table.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Please accept my deepest sympathy as you were one of his most 
                loyal officers.</p>
              <p>Narcissus takes out four scrolls, hands them to Commodus.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                These were my latest reports to Marcus.</p>
              <p>But Quintus takes them.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                I want to extend my hand in gratitude for what you have done for<br>
                my father and Rome, and to offer my friendship. The next few weeks 
                will be trying. As you know Marcus wisely or unwisely laid the<br>
                foundations for greater Senatorial control and there are those 
                likely<br>
                to take advantage of his good intentions. Will you join me in<br>
                strengthening my government? As you know your support, your friendship 
                at this critical moment would silence a dangerous faction.</p>
              <p>While they speak Quintus unrolls the documents. He's not happy 
                reading them.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                Serious stuff...</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans 
                will<br>
                try one last offensive. They've got nothing to lose and it's so 
                very<br>
                like them.</p>
              <p>Commodus and Quintus swap a fast look.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal 
                back<br>
                across the Danube.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                We have to stop the Germans now!</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                We must obey our emperor and the Senate.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce 
                with<br>
                the Germans.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the<br>
                whole Senate or the will of the Roman people? Besides, every truce<br>
                we make with the Germans they break!</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                They won't break this one.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                What deal?</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual<br>
                basis.</p>
              <p>Narcissus reacts as if he'd been stabbed.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging 
                for mercy?<br>
                Have you told your troops that?</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                My troops don't make policy.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Well, they die for it!</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                Narcissus -- it's over! Pack and come home with us...</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                You have a wise woman by your side.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here. 
                The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me. 
                I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                I can't let you do that.</p>
              <p>Narcissus turns and for the first time really looks<br>
                Quintus over.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                In you armor, Quintus? Is that how you come to visit a friend?</p>
              <p>They stare at each other. Narcissus goes for his sword just as 
                LEGIONNAIRES rush in. Commodus backs against the tent wall. Narcissus 
                heaves one soldier into the furniture, fells another with a chair 
                and grabs his sword...</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                Don't kill him!</p>
              <p>Three soldiers tackle Narcissus to the floor. Soldiers grab Selene 
                and the children -- Lindo reaches for a knife and he's immediately 
                killed. The children SCREAM...</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                Narcissus...!</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. CELL - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Narcissus sits in the dirt leaning against the log wall, his 
                hands chained in front of him. The door opens and four heavily 
                armed Praetorian Guard enter.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. CELL - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Narcissus stands in the pouring rain facing Falco, Gaius, Tribuus 
                and several tribunes. Four slaves hold a canvas over Commodus 
                and the others -- as they talk Narcissus continues to be drenched.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Where is my family?</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate. I could have<br>
                executed you.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.</p>
              <p>They glare at each other in the dark; Commodus' eyes seem<br>
                to burn in the lamp light.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                The army is a problem. They love you. You have led them from victory 
                to victory in the name of Rome and they love you. And after all, 
                you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty 
                -- who could fault you for that?<br>
                (nods to Falco)<br>
                Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate:<br>
                instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will<br>
                be tried...</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                On what charge?</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                Insubordination. To the Emperor... and the Senate.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to<br>
                celebrate your victory. They will hear that you are living in 
                luxury.<br>
                He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life.<br>
                And soon the army won't even remember your name.</p>
              <p>All turn and leave but Gaius. Two soldiers hold Narcissus while 
                a third goes through the process of chaining his wrists.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                The Senate too?</p>
              <p> GAIUS<br>
                The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear. 
                If<br>
                you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy 
                to<br>
                both. We needed to know what you believed.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I hope you live to see what I believe...</p>
              <p>At that the soldiers drag Narcissus toward a wagon with tiny 
                barred windows.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. PRISON WAGON - NIGHT</p>
              <p>In the dark Narcissus is chained to a bench and the door slams 
                shut.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. PRISON WAGON WHEEL - DAY</p>
              <p>The thick spoke wood wheel slams over rocks and ruts of a<br>
                primitive forest road.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. WAGON - DAY</p>
              <p>Narcissus jars awake and flies swarm off his face. A<br>
                GERMAN PRISONER is chained to the wall, a rag-wrapped<br>
                chain around his mouth as a gag. His head nods forward;<br>
                could be asleep, could be dead. Narcissus leans forward<br>
                and is stopped by his own chains. He glares at the rusted<br>
                iron links as if they were the most unbearable insult.</p>
              <p> JUBA<br>
                Narcissus!</p>
              <p>At the far end of the wagon is Juba. Looks like he's been worked 
                over pretty good. They stare at each other.</p>
              <p> JUBA<br>
                You on your way to trial, too,<br>
                general? Or do you think they've already had our trial?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Why you?</p>
              <p> JUBA<br>
                My loyalties... were in doubt.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at 
                our trial.</p>
              <p> JUBA<br>
                That's what worries me...</p>
              <p>Suddenly hands LURCH FOR HIS THROAT but are stopped by<br>
                chains. It's the gagged German. He drops his arms, but<br>
                keeps his eyes lowered staring at the Imperial Roman Eagle<br>
                around Narcissus' neck.</p>
              <p> FADE TO:</p>
              <p>EXT. ROME - DAY</p>
              <p>Wearing a flowing toga and golden laurel, Commodus rides<br>
                into Rome in a military chariot through the Arch of Titus<br>
                that leads down the 'Sacred Road' through the Forum. A<br>
                skeleton force of legionnaires parade just behind as DRUMMERS 
                beat a brisk tattoo. Tribuus walks ahead of the chariot as two 
                legionnaires hold military standards on high.</p>
              <p>First they pass the Senate on their left where the Senators stand 
                on the steps to greet him. Falco is out front and raises his arms 
                in welcome. As they pass the Senate they're surrounded by citizens.</p>
              <p> TRIBUUS<br>
                Marcus Aurelius Commodus Antoninus Augustus, Emperor of Rome, 
                conqueror of the German tribes! Master of the Danube! All of Rome 
                salutes you!</p>
              <p>Citizens of Rome line the way. Some cheer, but most are quiet. 
                And that silence is unnerving. Then:</p>
              <p> VOICE<br>
                Romans do not pay tribute!</p>
              <p>And that causes a landslide of yelling. Commodus stares dead 
                ahead as they're now forced to run a gauntlet of outraged citizens. 
                Finally his chariot picks up speed as it continues through the 
                forum toward the palace on the Palatine Hill.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. IMPERIAL PALACE - DUSK</p>
              <p>While Commodus paces like a caged animal, Falco walks to and 
                fro oddly trying to keep up with him. Lucilla sits stretching 
                her legs; after the long trip she looks exhausted. A slave pours 
                wine.</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                The Senate is out to sink you. I swear it, Caesar, your generosity 
                is<br>
                being repaid with public attacks on your honor. Your enemies want 
                you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed 
                the Senate will be able to deny you.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                How can they? Who else is there? I have no heir...</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                That's the point, dear brother, your 'heir' is the Senate. And 
                believe<br>
                me, they know it.</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                Do not take this lightly, Caesar. They mean to abolish the mperorship. 
                If they do you and your sister will be executed.<br>
                You've got to plan your moves as seriously as if you were going 
                to<br>
                war.</p>

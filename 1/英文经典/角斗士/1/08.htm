                PROXIMO<br>
                Welcome to Rome.<br>
                (pause)<br>
                Who are you?</p>
              <p>Instead of answering, Narcissus holds out his cup.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                You're a legate in the Roman army.<br>
                Huh...? and you act like one.<br>
                What was your crime?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I killed too many barbarians.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                I'm a Greek, thank you. And I was brought up believing Romans 
                were the barbarians.<br>
                (to slave)<br>
                Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white. Relax, tell me<br>
                everything, I'm your friend.</p>
              <p>Dala fills Narcissus' cup. After a second of hesitation Narcissus 
                drinks... and it's good.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Who the hell are you?</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life 
                at<br>
                any rate. I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school<br>
                which is named after me. I own this school and everything that's 
                in it.<br>
                (laughs)<br>
                You're in it! But why? What did a Roman general do to get himself<br>
                condemned to the Colosseum?<br>
                Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets. Please, 
                I<br>
                separated you from the others because...<br>
                (sniffs loudly)<br>
                ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Condemned? Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, 
                and a trial is nowhere to be seen.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Impossible! Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!</p>
              <p>One of the attending SLAVES chuckles and is hushed by a<br>
                glare from Proximo.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                In Rome, you will discover, all things -- especially the most<br>
                unthinkable -- are possible. What were you charged with?</p>
              <p>Now Narcissus won't talk.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Well, it probably doesn't matter.<br>
                Probably you'll be dead tomorrow.<br>
                But it might matter tonight because I'm going to plead with Jerses 
                head of the circus to have you instituted as a gladiator immediately. 
                He's a loathsome pig but in this business one doesn't get to choose 
                one's friends. Your business too, maybe?<br>
                Oh yes, the arena slaves took this from you. It's yours, isn't 
                it?</p>
              <p>A slave hands Narcissus' small box of ancestors to Proximo who 
                hands it to Narcissus.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Thank you. What is going to happen tomorrow? Exactly?</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                You are to be killed, exactly.<br>
                They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your<br>
                murder... entertaining. Romans like to mix their metaphors: laughter<br>
                with their executions, you know? If you survive, though, you will 
                become a gladiator. A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Death is a very light thing for you.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Death is... everything for me. Now you have to go to your cell, 
                and I<br>
                to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well. I want you to be 
                fit as<br>
                you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow! I want all my gladiators 
                to win and be happy! Besides, I've never owned a Roman general 
                before.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. GLADIATOR SCHOOL YARD - DAY</p>
              <p>Narcissus is led through the yard -- notes Adonis on his right 
                and Dala following along behind. Two armed slaves flank them in 
                a tight formation. Dala and Adonis watch Narcissus with a mix 
                of curiosity and awe; Adonis knows what he's thinking.</p>
              <p> ADONIS<br>
                Escape is impossible, general.<br>
                First you have these guards who will not hesitate to kill you. 
                Then you<br>
                have the Praetorian Guard, and then the Rome city police...</p>
              <p> DALA<br>
                The vigiles, Vigilant Patrols.<br>
                They're everywhere... you don't know if maybe even your best friend 
                could be a spy.</p>
              <p>GLADIATORS range around the walled-in open space -- like a<br>
                mini-arena -- working out in the sunshine. Some lift WEIGHTS made 
                from crude chunks of iron or rock; there's a primitive BOW-FLEX 
                DEVICE made from real bows. Bored armed GUARDS range the walkway 
                atop the wall.</p>
              <p>A PIECE OF CLOTH WEIGHTED DOWN WITH A ROCK flutters over<br>
                the wall and thuds in the square and there's a short scramble 
                as gladiators rush for it. Finally the 'note' is passed on to 
                Adonis.</p>
              <p> ADONIS<br>
                Crassus, it's for you.</p>
              <p>A tall, handsome gladiator: &quot;CRASSUS THE SPARTAN&quot; whose<br>
                hair is woven with TINY SILVER BELLS, stands beside Adonis<br>
                in expectation.</p>
              <p> CRASSUS<br>
                Come on! Tell me what it says!</p>
              <p> ADONIS<br>
                (reading)<br>
                &quot;I dream of your muscles, dear<br>
                Crassus!&quot;<br>
                (howls from the<br>
                others)<br>
                &quot;... and pray the one between your legs is as large as the 
                one between<br>
                your ears is small!&quot;</p>
              <p>Hoots as Crassus grabs the 'note' away from Adonis.</p>
              <p> DALA<br>
                For a price Proximo can manage a meeting for any lady...</p>
              <p>A gladiator with Bad Teeth moves up to intercept Narcissus. The 
                man's lost teeth are replaced with glued- in bits of colored stone. 
                He looks Narcissus over, scoffs and returns to his friends. As 
                they pass along a wall it dips to waist level over a sheer drop. 
                Narcissus stops at the view.</p>
              <p>FAR BELOW</p>
              <p>... is the FORUM OF ROME with its bustling street and squares 
                and magnificent buildings.</p>
              <p>From here Narcissus can see the Roman Temples: that of<br>
                the Divine Claudius; Venus and Rome; Mars Ultor; the Temple of 
                Minerva; of Peace; the Divine Julius; of Castor and Pollux; of 
                the Vestal Virgins. Each like a miniature Parthenon seems to faintly 
                GLOW.</p>
              <p>FURTHER...</p>
              <p>Beyond are the Domus of the upper classes and the insula of the 
                poor. Actually overwhelmed by the sight; perhaps it gives Narcissus 
                hope.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. CELL - DUSK</p>
              <p>TIGHT ON the ceramic FACE OF HIS ANCESTORS looking like a<br>
                row of hollow caricatures. They seem to be watching...</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>who sits in the shadows of his cell that's twenty feet square. 
                There are two barred windows, one on the rear wall and another 
                on the side wall. Finally Narcissus rises... he takes up one of 
                the ceramics, snaps a piece off on the side of the table to get 
                a nice sharp edge. He<br>
                rolls back his sleeves and starts to open the vein of his left 
                wrist.</p>
              <p>FROM ABOVE Dala shouts down from a small window in the<br>
                roof. The cell door flies back and TWO SLAVES tackle Narcissus. 
                Dala enters followed by Proximo. Dala pushes one of the slaves 
                aside and grabs Narcissus' wrist.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Take your hands off me animal!</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Chain him.</p>
              <p>The slaves immediately bind Narcissus' wrists with a leather 
                strap that's locked with a metal cleat.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise 
                I won't<br>
                even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves 
                to get<br>
                you here. I know what you're trying to do: kill yourself and trust 
                in<br>
                the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your 
                family<br>
                survive and keep their lands. The only thing you have accomplishes 
                is<br>
                to prove you're a very important individual. You make me feel 
                good<br>
                about my investment! And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even<br>
                discuss you. Both of you have clamped mouths! But I love all my<br>
                fighters -- I'll find out about your family. And about you. That 
                I<br>
                promise.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I refuse to be your slave. I<br>
                refuse --</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                -- to fight? We'll see...</p>
              <p>Proximo leaves and the door shuts behind him. Narcissus is left 
                chained in the dark.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. GLADIATOR WAGON - MORNING</p>
              <p>The side of a broad barred opening like an animal circus wagon 
                designed to show-off the creatures inside. The gladiators watch 
                Narcissus: various men, all colors, all showing battle scars...</p>
              <p>GANG KIDS dressed like gladiators chase the wagon shouting: &quot;Gladiator 
                -- Hey, Gladiator!&quot; &quot;Crassus!<br>
                Crassus The Spartan! Throw us a head&quot; &quot;Hey -- Bad Teeth!&quot; 
                Who you going to skewer today?!&quot;</p>
              <p>Most catch up to the wagon slogging along in rush-hour<br>
                traffic and hammer the sides with their FISTS.<br>
                Fascinated, Narcissus leans close to the bars -- LITTLE<br>
                KID FACES peer back.</p>
              <p> BLOND KID<br>
                You're new! Hey! A new one!</p>
              <p> MANY KIDS<br>
                You're dead! They're gonna rip your guts out! You're dead -- dead!<br>
                Dead guts!</p>
              <p>Then they pass the senate steps -- Senator Gaius and an<br>
                AGED SENATOR who seems from another era, GRACCHUS, address a crowd. 
                The kids peel away from the wagon and shove<br>
                through the audience. Narcissus presses to the bars for a good 
                look.</p>
              <p> BAD TEETH<br>
                Friends of yours?</p>
              <p>The gladiators laugh. But as they pass, Narcissus watches the 
                senators.</p>
              <p> GAIUS<br>
                Shall we allow Commodus to turn the labor of Marcus Aurelius upside 
                down? Are we Romans or dogs?!</p>
              <p>The KIDS START BARKING. The cart veers toward the<br>
                enormous flank of the Colosseum. A FAT PERSIAN TICKET<br>
                SCALPER and his two young SONS man a table holding ivory<br>
                Colosseum tickets like fans of cards, shouting seats and<br>
                prices.</p>
              <p>FOUR ROME WHORES ending their day laugh and wave at the<br>
                cart. A CUTE WHORE in a yellow wig blows them a kiss.<br>
                SOUNDS OF THE COLOSSEUM CROWD RISE OVER...</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. COLOSSEUM ARENA - DAY</p>
              <p>FEET of the MOB in the Colosseum stamping as their chanting VOICES 
                echo in shock waves through the giant marble chamber.</p>
              <p>AND COMMODUS</p>
              <p>Standing for the crowd. He's surrounded by members of the<br>
                Imperial Household -- Lucilla on his right beside Falco.<br>
                Commodus sits, seems nervous.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Don't you think you should at least wave?</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Why? Then they'll notice when I'm gone. Well. I'm making a public<br>
                appearance aren't I?</p>
              <p>ARENA</p>
              <p>GLADIATORS parade single file through the arena. They strut their 
                stuff: flexing their muscles, gesturing obscenely as they receive 
                the cat-calls of young girls.<br>
                SATURNUS -- a muscular gladiator with waist-length wavy<br>
                hair stops to bask in the animal howls of the crowd.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>stands inside a heavily guarded double door watching the<br>
                action. As the 'Proximo gladiators' come in off the field<br>
                they sit on blocks of stone lining the wall. Then,<br>
                Narcissus spots Commodus and moves closer to the opening.</p>
              <p>Saturnus stops directly in front of the Imperial Box,<br>
                lifts his hand in the Roman salute -- which was the model<br>
                for the Fascist's salute.</p>
              <p> SATURNUS<br>
                Caesar! Those who are about to die,<br>
                salute you!</p>
              <p>It's the cue for the crowd to go WILD. Again Commodus<br>

                COLOSSEUM MAIN GATE</p>
              <p>As Narcissus turns away, Proximo pulls him aside. Adonis<br>
                joins them.</p>
              <p>JERSES RISES</p>
              <p>As drums roll ROME PROSTITUTES are pushed out into a far<br>
                end of the arena by armed arena slaves.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                In celebration the emperor Commodus' triumph in the arena and 
                the God's recognition of his divine lineage, these prisoners shall 
                be -- in his glorious generosity -- freed! Or, Rome shall be freed 
                of this<br>
                pestilence forever!</p>
              <p>A DOOR SPRINGS OPEN --</p>
              <p>Out roar a BULL and a BEAR chained together...</p>
              <p>They're berserk crashing into each other. The chain is<br>
                fastened by a LARGE BRASS LOCK. An Arena Slave shoves a<br>
                Dark-Haired Prostitute into the arena and hands her a<br>
                bright metal KEY.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                Prisoner number one!</p>
              <p>Commodus stands in his seat and the audience roars its approval 
                -- this is going to be good!</p>
              <p> BAD TEETH<br>
                That pig!</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                Part these raging beasts so that as Titans of old they may retire 
                to<br>
                their abodes! Do so and you part the path to your own freedom! 
                An<br>
                arena attendant waits on you at the far end of the Colosseum...</p>
              <p>Sure enough, an Arena Slave opens a small door. The Dark-<br>
                Haired Prostitute moves forward toward the animals...</p>
              <p>AND NARCISSUS --</p>
              <p>Simply cannot believe what he's seeing.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Gods -- no!</p>
              <p>THE PROSTITUTE</p>
              <p>runs toward the shrieking beasts -- she lunges for the lock -- 
                with a vicious snap of his neck the bull impales her on his right 
                horn and flings the girl over his shoulder. The body lands like 
                a twisted doll, bloody in the perfect sand.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                Prisoner #2!</p>
              <p>Prostitute #2 is handed another key and the Arena Slave once 
                again opens the far door.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Commodus is a mad man, at home in a mad world.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                Separate these beasts and be<br>
                separated from us!</p>
              <p>Prostitute #2 takes one look at the situation and turns to bolt 
                back inside.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                Now, there's a wise woman. Some people recognize reality when 
                they<br>
                see it. How's your eye sight these days? Well, look at this: we 
                have<br>
                a fresh offer for you from the Emperor. Forget being his<br>
                supporter, fight in the arena side by side. Imagine, the two greatest<br>
                gladiators on earth, shoulder-to- shoulder against all comers! 
                It<br>
                will remind everyone of your glory days fighting alongside Marcus<br>
                Aurelius! And you'll be free and rich!</p>
              <p>Narcissus sends a fleeting glance toward the ARENA as Prostitute 
                #2 claws at the marble walls.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Now, now! Would you leave us in the<br>
                midst of our entertainment?!</p>
              <p>CRAZED laughter and cheers from the mob. Arena Slaves<br>
                appear with torches and whips beat Prostitute #2 until<br>
                finally she rushes toward the animals, screaming...</p>
              <p>Narcissus -- turns away as the ROAR OF THE CROWD signals<br>
                another death in the arena, Now the Cute Whore is pushed<br>
                into the arena and handed a key. Narcissus charges the<br>
                opening but is violently shoved back by Arena Slaves.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                What are you fighting for in here?<br>
                The good of Rome? I can end this madness now! Take the job for 
                the sake of the Gods, live!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Can you stop that slaughter?! Can you free these men?</p>
              <p>Quintus shakes his head in frustration. In the ARENA the<br>
                Cute Whore drops the key and as the audience ROARS she<br>
                walks to her death.</p>
              <p>QUINTUS</p>
              <p>turns to leave and Narcissus goes for him and is thrown to<br>
                the ground by four huge Praetorian Guard. Vednas, Dala<br>
                and Bad Teeth leap in between them and a sword that was<br>
                homing in on Narcissus stops at the last second. Quintus<br>
                clears out and his men follow. Proximo slumps down beside<br>
                Narcissus.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Jerses has you fighting a retiarius from the school of Lykas.</p>
              <p> VEDNAS<br>
                The net man!</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS ENTERS THE ARENA</p>
              <p>and the crowd begins its &quot;surrender or die&quot; chant for<br>
                Narcissus and the retiarius HURLS HIS NET -- but timing<br>
                his charge Narcissus dashes beneath the net before it even<br>
                settles behind him he's knocked aside the retiarius<br>
                trident and killed him. It happens so fast the audience<br>
                GASPS before CHEERING.</p>
              <p>Narcissus rises, then bathed in cheers he holds his arms<br>
                straight in the air and points his sword at Commodus.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I want you! I challenge you! Come down here and fight me!<br>
                (to the cheap seats)<br>
                You may battle for the knights and equates and Senators -- but 
                I<br>
                challenge you in the name of the ordinary citizen of Rome!</p>
              <p>For a moment there's dead silence -- and for a moment<br>
                Narcissus must wonder if he's gone too far. Then the mob<br>
                EXPLODES to new heights of rapture. Laughing, Narcissus<br>
                holds his arms up to the crowd as if to say: &quot;Anytime,<br>
                any place...&quot; Then to roars, he struts out of the arena.</p>
              <p>IMPERIAL BOX - NEAR DUSK</p>
              <p>Commodus slumped in the curule chair. Quintus, Lucilla<br>
                and Falco are with him.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- 
                I was<br>
                wholly in power.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a<br>
                philosophical temperament.</p>
              <p>Commodus gets up, scowls at Falco and paces.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Damn him! I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk 
                me<br>
                out of that.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                What have I got now? It's exactly as if there were two emperors.<br>
                Because of this the people have two minds. He is their champion.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                It's because he comes off as the underdog.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Underdog! How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time! I'm 
                the<br>
                emperor why can't I kill him? He could be poisoned, or somehow 
                killed to look like an accident.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                You don't want to kill him. If anything happens to him now you 
                will<br>
                be blamed... and he knows it.<br>
                Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress. It would take the 
                army to<br>
                break in there. What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword.<br>
                If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is 
                he? He's<br>
                gone. And you are a hero for awarding it.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                He wouldn't take the wooden sword, not in a thousand years.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                You're so sure, aren't you? If I were you I'd gleefully accept 
                his<br>
                challenge. Despite those who would thwart you, my agents have 
                been<br>
                busy.</p>
              <p>Commodus looks from Quintus to Falco and Lucilla; understands 
                he means THEM.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. COLOSSEUM - MORNING</p>
              <p>Narcissus sits with his group of gladiators watching Arena<br>
                Slaves assemble on the floor of the Colosseum with their<br>
                sand 'grooming' tools.</p>
              <p>Four huge crates are eased onto the the field on wood<br>
                rollers. The sides are cracked open and bright white SAND<br>
                spills out. SOUND OF THE CROWD SEEMS TO RISE FROM THE<br>
                EMPTY SEATS --</p>
              <p> MATCH CUT TO:</p>
              <p>PACKED SEATS</p>
              <p>The mob well into a day's action. Dala, mounted on an<br>
                ostrich, darts around the arena as he battles A GIANT OF A<br>
                MAN who must be seven feet tall.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>armored-up, checking his sword. Proximo arrives.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Something strange; I still haven't got your fight for the day.</p>
              <p>Dala makes a final charge against the 'Giant' and as he raises 
                his ax and he catches him in the stomach with his sword. The crowd 
                thinks it's the funniest thing on earth.</p>
              <p>Then two GLADIATORS approach from a side door and position<br>
                themselves near Narcissus' entrance.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                Narcissus Meridas! Come forward!</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                It's damned fix! They're going to murder you -- I can't watch!</p>
              <p>He GAWKS...</p>
              <p>THE ARENA</p>
              <p>Narcissus steps into the blistering sun and is stunned to see 
                Commodus approach him, dressed in his lion's skin and carrying 
                a long, shiny sword. He looks up at the Royal Box.</p>
              <p>ROYAL BOX</p>
              <p>Lucilla and Falco sit flanked by Praetorian Guard.<br>
                Quintus enters with SELENE AND HER DAUGHTERS, puts a hand<br>
                on each little girl's shoulder.</p>
              <p>Narcissus looks as though he's physically struck. Selene stares 
                down at him, fighting back tears: Themis weeps openly while Manto 
                remains stoic. He lowers his sword... Commodus gets near.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Narcissus Meridas! I accept your challenge in the name of the<br>
                Citizens of Rome!</p>
              <p>The audience goes crazy -- Commodus slashes out with his<br>
                sword and Narcissus instantly parries the blow. For a<br>
                moment Narcissus really turns it on and Commodus back-<br>
                pedals... and slowly he lets Commodus get the better of<br>
                him until Commodus knocks the sword from his hand.<br>
                Humiliated, Narcissus drops to his knees and holds up his<br>
                hand for mercy.</p>
              <p>But Commodus is so enrage that he lifts his sword to kill<br>
                him but... has just enough presence of mind to look up<br>
                into the crowd.</p>
              <p>THE PEOPLE</p>
              <p>shocked... then it spreads from the cheap seats through<br>
                the whole arena THUMBS UP! They chant for Narcissus to be<br>
                spared.</p>
              <p>AND COMMODUS...</p>
              <p>The last circuit breaker of self-preservation in his brain<br>
                kicks in and he RAISES HIS ARMS IN TRIUMPH. He walks<br>
                around the arena receiving their cheers -- finally he<br>
                feels like Emperor of Rome and tears streak his face.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>Now, alone in the center of the Colosseum. Commodus<br>
                returns to his box to an endless applause. This is his pure 'Triumph 
                of the Will' moment...</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Narcissus Meridas. Such glory as you have brought to the arena 
                of<br>
                Rome is redemption for the deeds which condemned you here and 
                thus I cannot find it in my warrior's heart to kill you!</p>
              <p>To wild applause Commodus lifts something that's wrapped<br>
                in silk, unfolds the silk and holds up a wildly colored WOODEN 
                SWORD.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                I honor you with the gift of the wooden sword -- your freedom! 
                What<br>
                say you citizens of Rome?!</p>
              <p>The audience goes into a sustained roar of joy. Commodus<br>
                hands the wooden sword to Quintus who heaves in onto the<br>
                sand at Narcissus' feet. Then random voices demand that<br>
                he &quot;SPEAK -- SPEAK!&quot; While from the cheap seats: &quot;Don't<br>
                leave us! Refuse the sword!&quot; This open argument blurs<br>
                into a cacophony of howls. Then the crowd falls silent.</p>
              <p> VOICE<br>
                We love you, Narcissus!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I am honored that the citizens of Rome, after trying their very 
                best<br>
                to kill me for so long -- have decided I am no longer worth the<br>
                effort and should be spared!</p>
              <p>Roars of laughter. Narcissus looks around. </p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I am not bitter about you, afterall, I have lived very much as 
                you do!<br>
                In fear! But unlike you, I can lift a sword and strike against 
                that fear<br>
                -- and so you dream of being me! Today I can walk out.<br>
                (locks eyes with<br>
                Selene)<br>
                Today I will walk out!<br>
                (to the crowd)<br>
                But you are condemned to stay...</p>
              <p>Narcissus scoops up a handful of sand and holds it up for<br>
                all to see, turning in all directions as the SAND MELTS THROUGH 
                HIS FINGERS.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Your lives! Citizens of Rome,<br>
                consider your lives...</p>
              <p>He looks up at Commodus -- and for just a second it seems<br>
                he still might refuse -- got Commodus worried. But then<br>
                he picks up the sword.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I accept... Caesar -- I accept your<br>
                generous offer!</p>
              <p>CHEERS of support from the crowd mixed with shouts of<br>
                dismay -- the sense that he's really abandoning a segment<br>
                of the population.</p>
              <p>Commodus glows, realizes that he has finally won.</p>

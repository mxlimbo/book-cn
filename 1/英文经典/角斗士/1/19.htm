                INT. GLADIATOR WAGON - LATE DAY</p>
              <p>Narcissus sits pressed between Dala and Proximo. Vednas<br>
                holds the coveted wooden sword in his hands like it was a<br>
                newborn babe. No one seems to be able to talk. Finally Bad Teeth 
                GRINS.</p>
              <p> BAD TEETH<br>
                Fuck a lot of girls for us!<br>
                (pause)<br>
                Boys too!</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                I'll have your gold for you. Even the third from the Olive oil.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I told you to keep the oil money -- but if you don't want it why 
                don't<br>
                you give it to the men?</p>
              <p>Adonis and Dala immediately fix on Proximo.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Let's talk about this later. Right now we have other things to 
                settle.<br>
                You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning 
                in the<br>
                morning to Ostia. From there, Caesar has decreed you be given 
                an<br>
                estate in Paestum. It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on 
                the<br>
                ocean. Rich soil.<br>
                (pause)<br>
                Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar 
                will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the 
                future,<br>
                keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I want nothing to do with the arena.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Something else, then. Do the chariot races interest you?</p>
              <p>KIDS suddenly run alongside the wagon -- faces we've seen<br>
                before. Dressed in their gladiator-esque costumes, but<br>
                today looking pretty pitiful. They call Narcissus' name<br>
                -- one reaches in and tries to take his hand but the wagon<br>
                speeds up leaving them in the dust.</p>
              <p> DALA<br>
                You beat the odds -- higher than at either the blue or the red 
                betting<br>
                booths!</p>
              <p>Narcissus searches all the faces he's come to know so well<br>
                in such a short time.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                So, we had a little spark, and we both did very well. Think of 
                me<br>
                when you're spending that miserable pension... in the sticks.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. TIBER PORT - LATE DAY</p>
              <p>The door on the gladiator wagon slips open and Narcissus<br>
                stands down. Praetorian Guard keep back a crowd shouting<br>
                Narcissus' name. Quintus escorts him to the dock and the<br>
                waiting boat.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Are you going to kill me here in front of the people of Rome or 
                in<br>
                front of my family?</p>
              <p>Quintus stops and they stare at each other. Quintus flashes his 
                characteristic smile.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                Come on... if you didn't make it to Paestum... All Rome would 
                know.<br>
                You're still safe, for now... Take my advice, get on that boat 
                and<br>
                don't look back.</p>
              <p>Quintus gestures to a legionnaire who stands with his back to 
                us.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                See he gets aboard.</p>
              <p>Quintus rushes off with Praetorian Guard. Ten remain to<br>
                keep back a crowd of kids and well-wishers who shout his<br>
                name. Those people are mostly poor, living without hope,<br>
                their cheers, the sound of damned souls.</p>
              <p>The legionnaire turns and it's the CENTURION, SERVIS.<br>
                Narcissus is about to react when Servis simply nods toward<br>
                the ship.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. SHIP'S DECK</p>
              <p>as Narcissus climbs on board he spots his family waiting for 
                him. Themis launches into his arms.</p>
              <p> THEMIS<br>
                Daddy!</p>
              <p>As Themis climbs halfway up his body the rest run to meet<br>
                them and they EMBRACE. Then he sees that Mela and her son<br>
                Masinissa are with them.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. REAR DECK - NEAR DUSK</p>
              <p>At a round table set up on the deck Narcissus, Mela, Selene, 
                Manto, Themis and Masinissa stuff themselves with bread and fruit. 
                CREW working the lines and cargo tie- downs pause to stare at 
                Narcissus -- a super-star in their midst.</p>
              <p>As they talk, Narcissus breaks off bread, passes olives,<br>
                oil and fruit, he keeps looking back toward the city where<br>
                again a plume of black smoke rises.</p>
              <p> MELA<br>
                Quintus' escort attacked us when we were ten leagues from the 
                front.<br>
                All but Juba died there.<br>
                (she hugs her son)<br>
                We'll get out of Italy somehow and back to Numidia. I'll raise 
                him<br>
                like his father.</p>
              <p> MANTO<br>
                Lucilla saved our lives, father.<br>
                Everybody wanted to kill us.</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                Manto's right, the leading Senators<br>
                fell in with Commodus and wanted us<br>
                sacrificed.</p>
              <p> MELA<br>
                If Quintus found us, Lucilla... her<br>
                days are numbered.</p>
              <p>Servis returns with some charred lamb and as he lays it<br>
                out Narcissus pulls up a stool so he can sit with them.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                What's happening out there?</p>
              <p> SERVIS<br>
                The Felix troops have gone over to the Senate. Tonight will decide<br>
                everything. They're fighting the Rome Legions and the Praetorian<br>
                Guard.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Why did Quintus bring in Felix troops with the Rome legions?</p>
              <p> SERVIS<br>
                He wanted to make sure Felix wasn't strong enough back at the 
                front to revolt. But when these legionnaire heard about you...</p>
              <p>Narcissus rises to study the horizon. He looks like a General 
                again.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. 'CABIN' - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Narcissus and Selene wake to the sound of someone opening<br>
                their door. Narcissus see it's Servis and follows him out. Selene 
                watches the pair framed in the opening in silhouette. A THIRD 
                MAN joins them.</p>
              <p>IT'S PROXIMO</p>
              <p>His slave sets a small chest down beside Narcissus. Then<br>
                he hands him a large, thick piece of paper. Narcissus quickly 
                reads it by lamp light.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Your gold, general. Commodus has gone crazy -- he's declared martial 
                law. People arrested after curfew will be used as human torches 
                to light the Colosseum. I must get back to seal up the school 
                against the riots. Spend this wisely.</p>
              <p>Narcissus stops him.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Lucilla? Any word?</p>
              <p>Proximo hesitates, but...</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                It is my position to know that... likely she is to be sacrificed 
                in<br>
                the arena. Tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Narcissus digests this, then:</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Commodus must hate you. Free your gladiators and come with us.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Are you mad? With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day 
                and night! Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment 
                business.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. DECK - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Narcissus watches Proximo scurry down the gang plank and<br>
                as he does two crewmen pull it up and prepare to depart.<br>
                Narcissus moves to the rail. Servis joins him strapping.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Let me have your sword.</p>
              <p>He puts his hand on the gold chest.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or 
                Spain.<br>
                Save my family. You should be able to find a merchant ship that 
                will<br>
                take you to Egypt then to Numidia.</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                No!</p>
              <p>Selene grabs Narcissus, unable to even think about losing him 
                again.</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                You're not going! You have to stay<br>
                with us!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power? 
                A month? Half a year? Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold 
                us until it's time...</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                Narcissus!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered? If I die fighting<br>
                Commodus he won't care about you.<br>
                If I live I'll come and get you.</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                I don't want you to die!</p>
              <p>Clinging to him she crumbles into tears.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I'll never die. You tell the girls that. You honor our ancestors 
                and<br>
                I'll be there. Every night. At the<br>
                table of life.</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                They'll have me. Teach them. Don't let them become like these 
                ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, 
                without meaning.<br>
                Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the<br>
                Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans. Teach them, who 
                we are!</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                You teach them!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                That's what I'm going to do. That's what I'm going to do...</p>
              <p>Servis unbuckles his sword and hands it over to Narcissus.<br>
                As the ship starts to move away from shore Narcissus<br>
                crosses to the far rail.</p>
              <p>RAIL</p>
              <p>Narcissus embraces Selene who is no-way ready to let him<br>
                go and Servis has to hold her back. Carefully he lowers<br>
                himself over the side.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. ROME - EARLY MORNING</p>
              <p>Narcissus, face muddied, moves carefully through the<br>
                narrow streets, trying to stay in the side alleys.<br>
                Vigilant Guards move through the main streets like Brown<br>
                Shirts -- they yank people into the street, lining them<br>
                up.</p>
              <p> VIGILANT LEADER<br>
                Caesar has declared this his holiday! Don't you want to be in<br>
                the arena? All of Rome will be there!</p>
              <p>HILLSIDE</p>
              <p>As Narcissus approaches Proximo's school he sees the great<br>
                wooden door have been smashed aside.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. PROXIMO'S SCHOOL</p>
              <p>Narcissus moves through smoke from a smoldering structure<br>
                and into the courtyard. They're all here: Dala, Adonis,<br>
                the others... as if they's gathered to make one last<br>
                stand. All dead. Many have been shot with arrows.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. PROXIMO'S OFFICE</p>
              <p>Proximo has died at his desk. Every drawer is broken into. Narcissus 
                lays a hand on his head.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Looks like they got your money after<br>
                all, old friend.</p>
              <p>Narcissus looks around the room, spots his Spatha Sword<br>
                and getting it he uncovers the top of a broken crate and<br>
                finds that Proximo had kept his MILITARY UNIFORM.<br>
                Narcissus puts his hands on his old lorica segmentata, the<br>
                decorations.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. YARD</p>
              <p>Wearing a full length toga, Narcissus moves down the<br>
                hillside. Behind him FLAMES engulf the school.</p>
              <p>SIDE STREET</p>
              <p>Narcissus comes on a half dozen dead legionnaire with red<br>
                'shoulders' -- they're from the Felix Division. As he<br>
                moves slowly he hears marching feet and ducks into an<br>
                alley as Praetorian Guard pass. Narcissus comes back into<br>
                the light -- then a HUGE CHEER -- like some distant<br>
                NATURAL FORCE -- echoes through the air...</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. COLOSSEUM - DAY</p>
              <p>Something HUGE creeps into the arena from the depths of<br>
                the Colosseum, sun glinting off it's sides as it emerges<br>
                into the light... the audience GASPS. It's an ENORMOUS<br>
                BRASS BULL dragged on wheels by slaves into the center of<br>
                the arena.</p>
              <p>The bull 'stands' on all fours, head back, horns rising<br>
                from the skull like regular bull's horns but finish up as<br>
                GIANT TRUMPETS AIMED AT THE SKY. The two sides of it's<br>
                'ribs' are open but BARS prevent anyone from getting out.<br>
                The belly of the bull is filled with SENATORS... and<br>
                Lucilla.</p>
              <p>At first the mob is uneasy, but seeing these &quot;high class<br>
                men&quot; in this absurd machine brings out the laughs.</p>

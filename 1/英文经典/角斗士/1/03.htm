                A challenging look from Commodus -- clearly Narcissus is not in 
                the mood to report to this boy. Quintus steps in.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                Gladly, Caesar. And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour 
                of the<br>
                front at first light.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                I'm certain father will be in better humors by then. Now, honor 
                us with your presence at dinner. I'll join you as soon as I see 
                my father's<br>
                physician.</p>
              <p>For a second Commodus eyes the shouting army... it makes him 
                NERVOUS. Then he turns to enter the building.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                What the hell was all that about?</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                What the hell do you think it was about? There's nothing an unproved<br>
                heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                Well, we can try...</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. ROMAN HQ - EARLY MORNING</p>
              <p>Inside the single large building at the Vindobona central base, 
                a wraith-like FORTUNE TELLER stands with her eyes closed, hand 
                on Falco's head.</p>
              <p>TRIBUNES and high ranking HANGERS-ON bask near a blazing<br>
                hearth like over-fed dogs. Senator Gaius sits apart near Juba 
                and his wife Mela. All are fixated on Falco.</p>
              <p> FORTUNE TELLER<br>
                ... a great man: great of birth -- great of girth!<br>
                (laughs all around)<br>
                Your fate in flame and bronze is wrought... the rest in haze is 
                sought.</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                Smoke from the fire no doubt!</p>
              <p>She opens her eyes and Falco hands her a coin.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Fire and bronze -- symbols of strong character, Senator!</p>
              <p>All turn toward Narcissus and Quintus.</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                General Narcissus, it's your turn!<br>
                Everyone in this room would love to know your future. Go on, ask 
                him if he'll stand for the Senate!</p>
              <p>Applause as Narcissus catches a smirk from Quintus.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one 
                day.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Narcissus! Terrified? You? The only thing he's scared of is me.</p>
              <p>Lucilla greets Narcissus with an embarrassingly intimate embrace. 
                Looks like she's been hitting the sauce pretty good.</p>
              <p> GAIUS<br>
                Slave! Wine and meat for our generals! The saviors of Rome!</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                Judging from your adoring troops and what we heard, Narcissus, 
                you are personally responsible for our victory.</p>
              <p>Lucilla hangs onto Narcissus' hand taking him around the room 
                like he was her date.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                You know our two most senior Senators: Gaius Cantus and Falco<br>
                Verus?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Only from a distance.</p>
              <p> GAIUS<br>
                Well let's not be so distant, general. Now that this war is ending 
                Rome needs good men off the battlefield as well.</p>
              <p> JUBA<br>
                The Wolf of Rome fought beside him.<br>
                I saw it with my own eyes.</p>
              <p>Narcissus looks at Juba as if to say 'thanks a lot.'</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                You see? The Gods favor you for greatness! Tell us about it -- 
                all<br>
                about it.</p>
              <p> VOICES<br>
                Yes/Tell us/Tell all!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                The truth is I got into a little trouble and when the army came 
                to<br>
                rescue me the German counterattack broke around us. An example 
                of<br>
                being in precisely the wrong place at exactly the right time.<br>
                (off their laughs)<br>
                It was Juba and his archers who finally got them running. Then<br>
                Quintus arrived with the Rome legions just in time to cut off 
                their retreat.</p>
              <p>Commodus and Galen suddenly step into the light; it's<br>
                unclear how long Commodus may have been listening in the<br>
                doorway. Everyone rises...</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Narcissus Meridas, you win the battle and deny you had any hand 
                it<br>
                it. But if we had lost, you would have taken complete responsibility.<br>
                Senators, Rome needs more such models of humility and courage.<br>
                (pause)<br>
                My father sends regrets that he will not join us after all as 
                he continues to be unwell.</p>
              <p>Commodus reaches over to fill Lucilla's cup which is nearly brimming.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                More wine, sister? Surely you can drink more than that.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Oh, stay...<br>
                (that was an order)<br>
                Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory? 
                Just remember, he is a married man.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an udience?</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                That's difficult to say, general.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.</p>
              <p> GALEN<br>
                It's difficult to name a time...</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                May I remind everyone that Master<br>
                Galen is the finest medical philosopher in the Empire and his 
                detailed assessment of the Emperor is delicate and confidential 
                and is<br>
                the business of the immediate family alone.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the 
                business<br>
                of every soul in the empire.</p>
              <p> GAIUS<br>
                Yes! The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate 
                are over -- thanks to your father! Now report to the Senate, Master 
                Galen: what is Marcus' state?</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Report, Master Galen, by all means.<br>
                The Senate demands it...</p>
              <p> GALEN<br>
                We are talking simply about a disturbance of the hues. Nothing<br>
                more. In precisely one hour I will analyze the Emperor's bile 
                and then<br>
                my assistants and I will stand by in an unfailing vigil until 
                his fever<br>
                breaks. Now with your permission Caesar, Senators? I must return 
                to<br>
                my patient.</p>
              <p>Commodus gestures him out as if he were just amused.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                One doctor now knows his place in the empire. Congratulations,<br>
                general, your victory seems to inspire courage everywhere.</p>
              <p>Quintus stops flirting with Lucilla's slaves and starts paying 
                close attention to the developing dynamics.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                The battle was won, today, and I<br>
                prefer to believe it was a gift of<br>
                Janus, the eldest God of Rome. God<br>
                of my ancestors.</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                God of passages and changes?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace<br>
                that will bring Rome her greatest glory. Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only<br>
                closed in time of peace. Sadly, it has remained open for three 
                hundred years.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I've read of it.</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                But have never been?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books. But 
                the<br>
                war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Then you'd be out of a job.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Gladly Caesar.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Or perhaps into a new one. But here's to your God and the courage<br>
                of our legions...</p>
              <p> GAIUS<br>
                And the man who gives them this extraordinary courage.</p>
              <p>Gaius stands and raises his cup. But Quintus is amused to<br>
                see him get as close to Narcissus as he can -- nearly hiding behind 
                him.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Quite so. Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long<br>
                to serve Rome...</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                And Caesar! Let's not forget to serve Caesar!</p>
              <p>Falco in turn moves to stand near Commodus.</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                They are one and the same my lady.<br>
                Which is why we senior Senators have chosen to be here on the 
                front to share the hardships of our courageous Emperor -- Marcus<br>
                Aurelius and his son -- may the gods protect them!</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Oh, yes, my father is a raving genius -- poet, essayist, philosopher, 
                warrior... It's a wonder he doesn't drift off like a cloud he's 
                so damned ethereal.<br>
                'Marcus Aurelius Etherealus'... But he should cast his divine 
                eyes<br>
                earthward once in a while and see how fallible some of his decisions<br>
                have been! Of course I don't mean you, Commodus -- gods know you're 
                perfect. As far as sharing in his glory and suffering -- well, 
                I<br>
                certainly didn't want to be here.<br>
                Isn't that true, darling brother?<br>
                Commodus, I believe, was afraid that if I stayed in Rome I might 
                foment a rebellion! Seize power for myself!</p>
              <p>Commodus glares at Lucilla as she trails off in laughter.<br>
                Mela decides it's time to rescue Lucilla from herself.<br>
                She rises and crosses to sit beside her.</p>
              <p> MELA<br>
                If you men are going to talk politics leave us out of it.</p>
              <p> JUBA<br>
                She's not so bashful about politics when we're alone.</p>
              <p> MELA<br>
                Only when it concerns Numidia. And, we're far from home so I'll 
                play the good Roman woman and listen -- perhaps Lucilla we could 
                play that part together.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                What do you say, Narcissus? Where are you in this great new balance<br>
                between the Emperor or the Senate?</p>
              <p> GAIUS<br>
                Are you for the Senate, Narcissus Meridas? Or do you back the<br>
                emperor?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints 
                you,<br>
                I'm not a politician...</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely<br>
                political. Not a Republican by any chance?</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                Be as brave here as you are on the battlefield...</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                In the presence of such fearless senators there's little need 
                for loyal soldiers to speculate on politics.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Ah, Quintus famous for his perfect timing. But we want to know 
                what<br>
                the hero of the Danube thinks.</p>
              <p>Dead silence. Every face in the room turns to Narcissus.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all 
                classes. At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.</p>
              <p> GAIUS<br>
                The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                We all know what right is, Senator.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows 
                what 'right' is.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.</p>
              <p>Stony silence. A SLAVE enters.</p>

                EXT. PRISON WAGON WHEEL - DAYS LATER - NIGHT</p>
              <p>The wheel bumps up from a rut and onto a road of precisely<br>
                cut polygonal lava blocks.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. PRISON WAGON - DAY</p>
              <p>The wagon STOPS. Narcissus wakes and looks across to<br>
                Juba. With a horrendous BANG the entire side of the wagon<br>
                falls away as it's unhinged by SOLDIERS.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. PRISON WAGON</p>
              <p>The prisoners are lined up facing a rank of soldiers holding 
                them at spear-point. Narcissus now sees that their wagon is part 
                of a convoy of four; all unload prisoners on the edge of a forest.</p>
              <p> JUBA<br>
                Is this Rome? Are we just going to be executed?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                They can't... if this is Rome...</p>
              <p>Narcissus is chained wrist-to-wrist with the German as all<br>
                the prisoners are CHAINED IN PAIRS. Juba gets chained to<br>
                a tall blonde German WARRIOR.</p>
              <p>NOW EVERYTHING HAPPENS FAST --</p>
              <p>A DOZEN ARMED MEN with feathers woven into their hair<br>
                charge at them from the far end of the path and dive them<br>
                down a trail that leads between a double row of tall oaks.<br>
                Cries, hoots and cheers surround them like an INVISIBLE<br>
                MASS OF HUMANITY and at the end of the grove there's this<br>
                unnatural GLOW.</p>
              <p>IN THE GROWING LIGHT</p>
              <p>they emerge into the center of a VAST ARENA that's been<br>
                'planted' with trees to imitate a forest.</p>
              <p>From the tops of the sheer twelve foot perimeter walls,<br>
                banks of seats slope away tier after tier until, at the<br>
                very tops of the seating are arch after arch, each framing<br>
                a marble statue of a different Roman emperor.</p>
              <p>THE PRISONERS...</p>
              <p>gawk at the enormous proportions of the building: it's<br>
                the COLOSSEUM of Rome. Looking back at them are FIFTY<br>
                THOUSAND FANS -- and as one, like some surreal canned<br>
                sound track they all LAUGH.</p>
              <p>Then to a fanfare of horns and drums a corpulent, self-<br>
                important man rises. This is JERSES -- head of the Roman<br>
                Circus. Jerses turns to the imperial box, but the marble<br>
                throne-like seat which has a carved wolf relief, is EMPTY.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                On this dawn! In celebration of the New Caesar, Lucius Aelius 
                Aurelius Commodus' glorious triumph over the German tribes I declare 
                these games -- which will run without interruption to the month 
                of Janus -- open to one and all!</p>
              <p>HOWLS and CHEERS from the audience -- many in the 'best<br>
                seats' (nearest the arena) rise and directly applaud<br>
                Jerses.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>Searching the row of prisoners he sees Juba staring dead<br>
                ahead.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                In sacrifice for Rome that the world might know the new Emperor's 
                love for his citizens, during these games two hundred pairs of 
                gladiators will fight to the death...!<br>
                (deafening cheers)<br>
                One thousand criminals will be devoured by wild beasts... there<br>
                shall be venationes! Battles be- twixt elephants and rhinoceroses;<br>
                bears and bulls; leopards and lions; exotic animals never seen 
                in Rome -- captured by our legions in their triumph in Africa 
                -- will be hunted to the death!</p>
              <p>Narcissus is staggered -- his head pivots around at the frantic, 
                blood-lusting crowd.</p>
              <p>ARCHERS...</p>
              <p>emerge from a door in a wall of the Colosseum, bows strung<br>
                over their shoulders, each carries a small jug and each<br>
                archer approaches a pair of chained-together prisoners.<br>
                As they DAUB PAINT on the prisoners' arms -- a particular<br>
                NUMBER for each pair -- spectators rise, pointing at<br>
                different pairs, some jotting notes. Juba and the Blonde<br>
                get daubed with a red 'III'.</p>

                open until curfew!</p>
              <p>A young, SURLY-LOOKING ARCHER gets to Narcissus and the<br>
                German. He snorts his disdain, then daubs a black Roman<br>
                numeral 'V' onto the German's arm -- but when he paints<br>
                Narcissus he decks the archer with his free hand. The audience 
                CHEERS and there's a spurt of note-taking in the stands.</p>
              <p>FROM THE CHEAP SEATS --</p>
              <p>a lanky GREEK, PROXIMO PALINDROMOS, instantly flashes his<br>
                dark eyes down into the mass of prisoners.</p>
              <p>PROXIMO'S POV</p>
              <p>Hard to see anything from this far up. He starts to turn away 
                when the German Warrior steps aside and as Narcissus is revealed 
                his OMAN EAGLE FLASHES.</p>
              <p>AND PROXIMO</p>
              <p>suddenly very interested... Quickly he looks across to the opposite 
                side of the arena where a pencil-thin man in a dark green toga 
                sits beside Jerses, also scrutinizing the prisoners. He looks 
                RIGHT UP AT PROXIMO. The man is LYKAS.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. COLOSSEUM</p>
              <p>Narcissus is shoved down an immense stone hallway mad with<br>
                activity.</p>
              <p>Juba is rushed along twenty feet ahead. Behind the huge doors 
                are drawn closed by two burly slaves but at the last second they 
                stop to let Proximo in.</p>
              <p>RAMP</p>
              <p>Narcissus herded with the others down a steep ramp. They<br>
                pass...</p>
              <p>-- huge baskets of FLOWERS being ground to juice and dumped into 
                a sluice.</p>
              <p>-- the side of a cage; as Narcissus passes, a leopard SLAMS against 
                the bars.</p>
              <p>-- Narcissus is pushed on, deeper into the guts of the Colosseum. 
                He gets a fast glimpse of a room where BUTCHERS chop out slabs 
                of meat. Bleeding ribs dangle from hooks...</p>
              <p>-- SLAVES charge in opposite directions along a tunnel yanking 
                pulley ropes as a CAGED BEAR rises from below.</p>
              <p>-- But now they're pushed deeper into the darkening 'basement' 
                until finally they reach --</p>
              <p>THE 'HOLE'</p>
              <p>Slaves wait with oil lamps to light their way as they run in 
                a semi-squat beneath the low stone ceiling. Prisoners GASP in 
                the choking air while around them come the banshee wails of other 
                PRISONERS. Finally they stop and Narcissus and Juba come face-to-face.</p>
              <p> JUBA<br>
                Fight! Feohtan!</p>
              <p>But Juba is knocked down by two guards -- one rears back to spear 
                him when Narcissus throws himself in front of Juba...</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Stop! Stop!</p>
              <p>The guard instantly backs off as torches converge lighting up 
                the claustrophobic tunnel. Proximo steps into the light as Narcissus 
                stands. Then he takes hold of Narcissus' Roman Eagle.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Is this your?</p>
              <p>Narcissus GRABS the eagle and shoves Proximo back.</p>
              <p>Proximo nods to slaves and Narcissus' chain is held up<br>
                against the wall and with two blows the links are broken<br>
                with a hammer. Narcissus is yanked back the way he came.<br>
                He just has time to look over his shoulder to see Juba<br>
                shoved into the hole and the door SLAMS behind them.</p>
              <p>MAIN HALL</p>
              <p>Exhausted, Narcissus is rushed back up the ramp into the<br>
                main hall where Proximo waits. Then a side door opens and<br>
                OUTSIDE LIGHT explodes in like a flashgun.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. COLOSSEUM - DAY</p>
              <p>Narcissus is led -- chained -- into the streets, armed slaves 
                urge him along as ahead Proximo rides in a sedan<br>
                chair.</p>
              <p>-- FOOD AND DRINK VENDORS shout and wave samples of their<br>
                wares;</p>
              <p>-- TICKET SCALPERS hold up IVORY TICKETS yelling out<br>
                Colosseum seat numbers;</p>
              <p>-- BOOKMAKERS stand on tables -- some with RED headbands,<br>
                some with BLUE -- screaming out names of various gladiators and 
                indicating their 'odds' with fingers as citizens queue up to bet;</p>
              <p>-- RELIC HAWKERS hold up pieces of gladiatorial armor<br>
                yelling the name of the dead gladiator and the number<br>
                of his victories;</p>
              <p>-- Lion paws and leopard ears are touted as potency<br>
                medicines;</p>
              <p>-- WHORES bare-chested with wildly painted breasts line<br>
                the road taking customers into the alleys...</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. PROXIMO'S GLADIATORIAL SCHOOL - DAY</p>
              <p>They approach ornate double wooden gates with carved action scenes 
                of gladiators in battle.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. PROXIMO'S INSULA - GLADIATOR SCHOOL - DAY</p>
              <p>Narcissus enters with two powerful armed SLAVES who unchain him 
                and give him water and bread. Proximo sits behind his 'desk' which 
                is a slab of thick rose volcanic rock polished to a high luster, 
                its corners supported by salvaged marble BUSTS painted in the 
                original garish Greek style: faces pink, hair brown or blond, 
                eyes white with brown or blue irises.</p>
              <p>Gaudy mosaics of gladiatorial battles hang on the wall over his 
                table. Narcissus eyeballs the setup: everything but pink flamingos.</p>
              <p>With Proximo is ADONIS THE BOXER: a tall, thick man, face<br>
                deeply scarred, nose pulverized. The other is an albino<br>
                dwarf -- DALA. Dala has Jimmy Winters -- white hair and<br>
                almost crimson eyes.</p>
              <p>Proximo stares at Narcissus for a time as Dala pours him a<br>
                cup of wine. Finally, Proximo drinks.</p>

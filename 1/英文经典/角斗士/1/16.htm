                GLADIATOR AREA</p>
              <p>Proximo puts his hand on Narcissus' shoulder.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us 
                both an offer: you take a fall.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                What the hell are you talking about, Greek?</p>
              <p>Proximo gestures to Adonis who folds aside a cloth revealing 
                a brown leather BLADDER.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach 
                --<br>
                it's full of pig's blood. Gushes out everywhere! It's really<br>
                impressive. Fantastic! Better than the real thing!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                So I pretend I'm dead. You get gold, what do I get?</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                You get to come alive again in the country!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small<br>
                arenas, relax, live the good life!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Spend my days beheading country bumpkins? I don't know, Proximo, 
                who has better wine than you?<br>
                Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                But -- you have to go out there!<br>
                I'll give you more than your one third! When I get paid... just 
                take<br>
                the fall! You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Pressures on, eh Proximo? There's got to be a load of money in 
                this.<br>
                Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                It's absolutely not like that! This is for your own good! Come 
                on get<br>
                the rest of your armor on!</p>
              <p>But Adonis approaches holding Narcissus' shield.</p>
              <p> ADONIS<br>
                General? Do you want me to strap on a shield? You can't hold it.</p>
              <p>In reply Narcissus lifts his injured arm as much as he can and 
                Adonis works to attach the shield. Then he checks with Narcissus 
                -- who seems noncommittal -- and stuffs the bladder under his 
                shirt. Outside the CHANTING rises.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting: 
                if this<br>
                were a fair fight where would you put your money?</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                On you! Of course! You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter<br>
                I have ever seen!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth. Take my advice and make 
                that bet.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Oh, shit. Take your time! Don't get suckered! This man is a<br>
                murderer! In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators. 
                Please,<br>
                just take the fall!</p>
              <p>ARENA</p>
              <p>Narcissus steps into the blistering sun. The crowd in the cheap 
                seats is on its feet applauding.</p>
              <p>COMMODUS</p>
              <p>sits in his box watching grim-faced. To his right sits Lucilla. 
                Falco sits near the emperor.</p>
              <p> TRIBUUS<br>
                He's going to take the fall. It's all set. He must, he was almost<br>
                killed yesterday. He has no choice.<br>
                By morning he'll be gone.</p>
              <p>ARENA</p>
              <p>As soon as Narcissus steps forward Tiger swirls around to face 
                him, beckons dramatically.</p>
              <p> TIGER OF DEATH<br>
                Come my sweet! The sacred sand of the arena lust for another life!<br>
                Satisfy her hungering!</p>
              <p>Then the cheap seats chant as one:</p>
              <p> CROWD<br>
                Surrender or I'll kill you!</p>
              <p>Tiger looks around, stunned. Narcissus yanks the bladder out 
                of his shirt -- holds it up for all to see and stabs it gushing 
                blood onto the sand.</p>
              <p>GASPS from the crowd and Tiger realizes he's in deep guano.</p>
              <p>The crowd works itself up again -- the noise they make is<br>
                that accelerating train sound of a British Football Mob.</p>
              <p>COMMODUS...</p>
              <p>Furious but trying to stay calm. Lucilla can't hide a smirk of 
                perverse pleasure.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Looks like old Tiger is going to have a good old fashion fight 
                on his<br>
                hands.</p>
              <p>ARENA</p>
              <p>Tiger charges Narcissus. The crowd shouts as their swords<br>
                cross and the battle is on. The two RAGE AT EACH OTHER.</p>
              <p>COMMODUS</p>
              <p>... motions to Tribuus.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                I want that bastard dead!</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their 
                hero.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                I am their hero!</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Not yet, dear brother...</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Send them out!</p>
              <p>THE ARENA...</p>
              <p>Narcissus HAMMERS at Tiger as if he were trying to chop<br>
                down a huge tree -- every blow rattles the old pro. With<br>
                each blow the crowd in the cheap seats echoes with:<br>
                &quot;Yes! -- Yes! -- Yes!&quot;</p>
              <p>Then a RETIARIUS and a SAMNITE -- a lightly armed Italian<br>
                (non-Latin) warrior with a jag-edge sword -- enter and<br>
                move in on Narcissus. The crowd erupts in thunderous<br>
                BOOING hurling Commodus' food back into the arena. Just<br>
                as suddenly Bad Teeth and Vednas shove into the arena to<br>
                flank Narcissus -- but they're unarmed.</p>
              <p>PROXIMO</p>
              <p>kicks a Slave -- yells out at them.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Jack asses! You'll all die! Get back in here!</p>
              <p>The crowd chants: &quot;ARM THEM -- ARM THEM!&quot; That's good<br>
                enough for Proximo -- he kicks the slave again.</p>
              <p>ARENA</p>
              <p>Two Arena Slaves dart out, hand Bad Teeth and Vednas<br>
                swords, run off and the crowd CHEERS. For a second Narcissus spots 
                Dala near the gate.</p>
              <p>COMMODUS</p>
              <p>watches the fight but Lucilla studies Commodus. Clearly<br>
                Narcissus is driving him mad.</p>
              <p>ARENA</p>
              <p>The battle now shapes up even, Bad Teeth driving the<br>
                Samnite back, Vednas and the retiarius circling.<br>
                Narcissus and Tiger LOCK ARMS -- swords frozen overhead,<br>
                they try to power the other down and it becomes a test of<br>
                strength. Narcissus starts to cave from the pain to his<br>
                wound.</p>
              <p>COMMODUS</p>
              <p>Stands -- this could be it... EVERYONE STANDS...</p>
              <p>ARENA</p>
              <p>But Narcissus digs deep, grits his teeth and Tiger<br>
                STAGGERS and FALLS, losing his sword. Instantly he's on<br>
                his feet and running like a scared rabbit as a slave rolls<br>
                out his chariot. Tiger leaps into his hot-rod, hefts a<br>
                thrusting spear and makes straight for Narcissus.</p>
              <p>There's a universal howl of rage from the mob as they fill<br>
                the air with pieces of food, sandals -- whatever is loose.<br>
                At that moment the Lykas retiarius overwhelms Vednas.</p>
              <p>Narcissus dodges Tiger's first charge and as the chariot<br>
                swings back into position he surprises the retiarius by<br>
                yanking his net backwards toppling the retiarius and<br>
                freeing Vednas.</p>
              <p>PROXIMO</p>
              <p>turns to Dala who's strapping his wrists.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                He can't do that! And what the hell are you doing?</p>
              <p> DALA<br>
                Waiting for the general's orders.</p>
              <p>ARENA</p>
              <p>Bad Teeth and Vednas drive their opponents back: But then<br>
                Narcissus motions Vednas and Bad Teeth back as Tiger lines<br>
                up for another run on Narcissus. Absolutely trusting him -- like 
                their general in battle -- Vednas and Bad Teeth move toward Narcissus 
                just as Tiger charges -- and Narcissus WAVES AT DALA.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Cavalry! Attack!</p>
              <p>Dala comes HOWLING into the arena on his ostrich buck<br>
                naked, spinning his red toga overhead. Tiger's horses<br>
                take one look at this yowling apparition and FREAK -- one<br>
                goes left, the other leaps UP -- Tiger's chariot CRASHES<br>
                hurling him onto the sand. The crowd CHEERS in one mad<br>
                voice.</p>
              <p>This love raining on him, Narcissus motions Bad Teeth and<br>
                Vednas back as he stands over the fallen Tiger. Defeated<br>
                and suddenly pitiful, he holds up his trembling forefinger<br>
                in the sign for mercy. But the crowd shouts, stamps their<br>
                feet and universally give the &quot;thumbs down.&quot;</p>
              <p>Narcissus looks around at the howling crowd, but does<br>
                nothing and finally they quiet because they can't figure<br>
                out why he hasn't killed him.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                He's surrendered! I can't kill him!</p>
              <p>For a second the crowd is dumbfounded. People look at<br>
                each other as if to say &quot;so what?&quot; Then they start<br>
                laughing.</p>
              <p> VOICES<br>
                This isn't the army! Kill him!<br>
                Kill him!</p>
              <p>Narcissus turns his sword around OFFERING THE GRIP TO THE<br>
                AUDIENCE.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Who will do it?</p>
              <p>They fall silent again. Then Narcissus laughs and HURLS<br>
                his sword up into the audience.</p>
              <p>LOWER SEATS</p>
              <p>People duck as the sword clatters on the marble seats. A<br>
                second -- then like a souvenir home-run ball everyone<br>
                seems to leap for it at once. Then EVERYONE LAUGHS as<br>
                Narcissus struts back across the arena, really PLAYING THE<br>
                CROWD.</p>
              <p>COMMODUS...</p>
              <p>slowly closes his eyes as if forcing back his rage.</p>
              <p>AND PROXIMO</p>
              <p>all but doing a jig.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                This man! My god! He can't do anything wrong! No matter how<br>
                stupid he is!</p>
              <p><br>
                INT./ EXT. ROYAL CHAIR - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
              <p>Surrounded as usual by Praetorian Guard, Commodus and<br>
                Lucilla are carried in the enormous 'chair' by slaves<br>
                through Rome. Commodus looks in the dumps, but then leans<br>
                out.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Tribuus! Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.</p>
              <p> TRIBUUS<br>
                Yes, Caesar.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                We need more statues -- perhaps I should open medical clinics. 
                For<br>
                the poor. Citizens only, though...</p>
              <p>COMMODUS' POV</p>
              <p>In the center of the bustling square is a magnificent<br>
                STATUE OF COMMODUS holding up a sword.</p>
              <p>But towering over the statue is an ENORMOUS MOSAIC<br>
                BILLBOARD OF NARCISSUS HOLDING UP A BOTTLE OF OLIVE OIL.<br>
                And it's done as an EXACT IMITATION OF THE POSTURING OF<br>
                THE COMMODUS STATUE HOLDING HIS SWORD. Beneath, in GILT<br>
                MOSAIC LETTERS: &quot;NARCISSUS DRINKS ONLY GOLDEN POMPEII<br>
                OLIVE OIL!&quot;</p>
              <p>AND COMMODUS...</p>

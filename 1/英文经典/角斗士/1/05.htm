                FIVE LITTLE FIRED TABLET PORTRAITS OF NARCISSUS'<br>
                ANCESTORS... each in an individual stand on a tiny alter.<br>
                Narcissus' table is set with five colorful wooden plates with 
                food and drink for each. Dressed again, he not so much as prays 
                to the tablets as carries on a conversation.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Postumas, Lilliana, Guyan,<br>
                Agrippina, Lartes. The battle is won, my family. Of course, I'm 
                sure<br>
                you were there with me, Guyan.<br>
                Grandmother always said you loved a good fight. Lilliana, I set 
                some<br>
                local fruit at your place tonight.<br>
                They're not bad. And don't tell me you don't like exotic food.</p>
              <p>He lights incense that goes up fast seeming to flood the tent 
                with smoke.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Welcome to the table of life, my ancestors.</p>
              <p>Narcissus hoists his arm onto a folding stool and leans his head 
                on his arm, exhaustion finally taking over. In the dark and the 
                smoke of the incense he falls asleep.</p>
              <p>THE ANCESTORS...</p>
              <p>There's a moment when their faces seem somehow alive in the ghostly, 
                shimmering smoke.</p>
              <p> VOICE<br>
                Daddy... Daddy! Daddy wake up!</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>slowly focuses on the portraits in the muted dawn light.<br>
                In front of the portraits is the beaming face of a YOUNG<br>
                GIRL. She's his six year old daughter THEMIS, a black-<br>
                haired, dark eyed beauty.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Themis!</p>
              <p>She holds a DOLL up in his face: it's a doll dressed up like 
                a Roman General.</p>
              <p> THEMIS<br>
                This is you, daddy.</p>
              <p>He picks her up and spins around to find his wife SELENE with 
                their older daughter MANTO. Now the others rush to embrace him. 
                A thirty-year old male house-hold slave -- LINDO -- enters carrying 
                woven bags of personal belongings.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Selene! Manto! Lindo, too! Oh,<br>
                gods... how did you get here?</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. CAMP - NEAR THE DANUBE - MORNING</p>
              <p>As the family walks along the edge of a slow moving, peaceful 
                bend of the great river, Themis holds her doll for Narcissus' 
                approval.</p>
              <p>Lindo walks close; though a slave he's clearly part of the family.</p>
              <p>Narcissus takes the toy likeness, makes sure his daughter<br>
                sees he's giving it a serious scrutiny.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                He's very realistic.</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                Isn't the helmet magnificent?</p>
              <p> THEMIS<br>
                I made the plume from a quail feather.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Much more colorful than the ones we wear. And, of course, less 
                dented.</p>
              <p> MANTO<br>
                Father, is it true the Germans are<br>
                just fighting to protect their land?</p>
              <p>Narcissus and Selene swap a fast look.</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Greeks?</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                Athenians...</p>
              <p>That sounds even worse.</p>
              <p> MANTO<br>
                Teacher says that the divine Julius used the Germans as a pretext 
                to<br>
                dissolve the Republic.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Did he now...?</p>
              <p> MANTO<br>
                And that the Germans are only struggling to keep their honor and<br>
                the ways of their people. And that throughout history Rome has 
                always been the aggressor.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Well, remind teacher: once upon a time it was the Hebrews over 
                the<br>
                Philistines; the Babylonians over the Hebrews; Egypt over Babylon; 
                the Greeks over the Trojans; Persians over the Greeks; Etruscans 
                over the Latins; Sabines over the Latins and Etruscans. Now it's 
                Rome over everyone and I don't know when the world has known such 
                peace.</p>
              <p> MANTO<br>
                I can't wait to tell my teachers all that!</p>
              <p>Can see Narcissus feels better about this already.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                What about their philosophy lessons?</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                They're studying with Cynics.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Of course...</p>
              <p> THEMIS<br>
                Daddy, Lindo says these forest are haunted by sprites and spirits! 
                Can we go to bed early so we can meet them in our dreams?</p>
              <p>Narcissus and Selene catch Lindo's smile...</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. TENT - LATE NIGHT</p>
              <p>Narcissus and Selene making love in the dark. From outside come 
                distant lightning flashes followed by the hollow roll of far off 
                thunder.</p>
              <p>Finally Selene collapses against Narcissus, but it looks like 
                she could go on for another hour if she just weren't simply exhausted. 
                They laugh quietly at their passion.</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                You need to come home!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I can see that...</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                The battle is over. The war is over. You've won!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                If you win, you know, you have to stay. It's the losers who get 
                to go<br>
                home. Besides, I'm not so sure it is over. Centurions report enemy<br>
                scouts probing our lines.</p>
              <p>Selene sighs, then gets an idea and slides out of bed; she returns 
                with a long necked jug.</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                Look what we've brought you all the way from Spain.</p>
              <p>He looks at the jug and the label.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                This is our oil from our estates?</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years,<br>
                you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.</p>
              <p>She pushed the bottle neck between her naked breasts and smiles.</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                If you want to know, you'll have to come and get it.</p>
              <p>Narcissus puts his hands on the base of the bottle, then lets 
                his hand slide to her breast. But she moves the bottle aside, 
                pulls him close -- but he snatches the bottle and gives it a good 
                look.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Very fancy. Did you design the bottle?</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                Who else? I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking<br>
                everything we have for the glory of Rome! Or for the glory of 
                you!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I'm a soldier -- we're at war. I can't stay home tending the damned<br>
                olive groves?</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.</p>
              <p>Narcissus cools down, sees this is going a bad way.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to 
                want that.<br>
                It's just that Marcus trusts me.</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                Let him trust Quintus.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Quintus is overly idealistic.</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                I never knew a more idealistic man than you.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Me? Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen,<br>
                how people outside the empire treat each other.</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.</p>
              <p>Silence. All the while they've been talking the storm has<br>
                been slowly approaching, thunder beating ominously closer.<br>
                Selene embraces him.</p>
              <p>Suddenly Manto and Themis leap into bed with them and push<br>
                beneath their bearskin blanket. Themis is crying and Manto is 
                shaken.</p>
              <p> SELENE<br>
                Girls! What's the trouble? Manto?</p>
              <p> MANTO<br>
                Lindo was right! This is a haunted place! The night spirits came 
                to<br>
                us...</p>
              <p> THEMIS<br>
                We had horrible nightmares!</p>
              <p>Lightning flashes and thunder drops like a bomb as the storm 
                settles on the camp. The girls pull themselves close to Selene 
                and Narcissus.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. NARCISSUS' TENT - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
              <p>Themis and Manto help Selene and Lindo pack the last of several 
                baskets.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll 
                follow as soon as I can.</p>
              <p> THEMIS<br>
                Tomorrow?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                As soon as I can.</p>
              <p> THEMIS<br>
                On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                On my honor as your daddy...</p>

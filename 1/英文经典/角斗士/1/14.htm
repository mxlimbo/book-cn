                INT. SENATE - MORNING</p>
              <p>Gracchus stands before the body of Senators.</p>
              <p> GRACCHUS<br>
                No trial! No defense! Narcissus Meridas, general of the VIIth 
                Felix<br>
                Gemini legions! How could this happen?</p>
              <p>Senate breaks into muttering and some yell for Falco to speak 
                -- very reluctantly he does.</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                I was one who agreed with the Emperor to do this thing along with<br>
                Senator Gaius!</p>
              <p>Shouts of outrage.</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                And with good reason: we were trying to avoid civil war!</p>
              <p> VOICE<br>
                But he deserved a full trial! Sit down, Falco! Gaius! Gaius!</p>
              <p> GAIUS<br>
                Narcissus Meridas deserves a full trial! Yes! Let the Senate become<br>
                the champion of the people!</p>
              <p> VOICES<br>
                Yes! Yes!</p>
              <p> GAIUS<br>
                And then let the Senate crush their hopes, further humiliate Narcissus<br>
                by sending him back to the arena, and let us by all means make 
                the<br>
                Emperor look good while we do it!</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                The truth of it is that he defied a direct order of his Emperor 
                and the<br>
                acting Senate!</p>
              <p> GRACCHUS<br>
                It was a disgraceful order!</p>
              <p>More shouts as Senators stand at will.</p>
              <p> GAIUS<br>
                Narcissus is guilty as charged and this body would have to lie 
                long to<br>
                find otherwise!</p>
              <p> VOICE<br>
                Sit down you traitor!</p>
              <p> GAIUS<br>
                I will not sit down! I will not sit<br>
                down!</p>
              <p>The Senate disintegrates into squabbling.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. NARCISSUS' CELL - NEAR DUSK</p>
              <p>Narcissus slowly wakes. He sees Adonis and Dala. Though<br>
                Dala slumps in a corner, asleep, Adonis carefully crushes<br>
                garlic bulbs in a mortar. Confused, his eyes stray around<br>
                the room and fix on a CRUDE POSTER OF HIMSELF holding up a<br>
                sword nailed to the wall.</p>
              <p>Proximo enters, kicks Dala awake and kneels beside<br>
                Narcissus. He helps him sip water.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                General, hang on... drink slowly.<br>
                You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of 
                Janus with you tonight. A fan sent them to you.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Alive... I'm alive...</p>
              <p>Narcissus seems disappointed, disoriented and at first,<br>
                possibly delirious. The doctor kneels on his right, the<br>
                Divine on the left.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Your fans have gathered below in a vigil. Even the Senate, that 
                swamp<br>
                of double talking dung beetles is discussing you.</p>
              <p>The Doctor carefully works on his arm taking garlic from<br>
                Adonis and smearing it on the wound.</p>
              <p> DIVINE<br>
                I'm here to guide you through the gates of Janus, general.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                My daughters, my wife. Are they<br>
                there?</p>
              <p>But the Divine shuts her eyes, muttering almost inaudibly.<br>
                The Doctor works -- as if it were a contest between the<br>
                pair. The door opens and Vednas pokes his head in,<br>
                gestures to Proximo who exits.</p>
              <p>Narcissus looks up at the two windows and sees FACES<br>
                peering in at him. They're the other GLADIATORS who live<br>
                in Proximo's school. One is tying a charm of leopard<br>
                claws to the bars.</p>
              <p>Then the door opens and Lucilla is ushered in by an ultra<br>
                fawning Proximo. Lucilla wears a veil which she lowers as<br>
                she sits beside Narcissus.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                I knew they'd never kill you.</p>
              <p>It takes Narcissus a second to focus and when he sees he<br>
                grabs her by the throat with his good arm -- Proximo and<br>
                Adonis pry him loose... for a second Lucilla chokes.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Yours will do!</p>
              <p>Narcissus winces with pain from the effort and Lucilla leans 
                beside him against the wall.</p>
              <p> DOCTOR<br>
                General, you nearly opened your wound.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Keep that up and you'll make everyone happy.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Don't be ridiculous.</p>
              <p> ADONIS<br>
                If you die, general, I'll kill them<br>
                both for you.</p>
              <p>The Doctor and the Divine look at Adonis, then to Lucilla<br>
                for a clue.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                I came here to see that you stay alive. The people need a living<br>
                breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                But you do exist. Narcissus: hero of the battle of the Danube.</p>
              <p>Narcissus tries to laugh, but it just hurts.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                You've got the Senate scared they'll have to explain to the people 
                how<br>
                they joined the Emperor in illegally condemning you. And ommodus, 
                he lies awake thinking how he could kill you, and finally rid 
                himself of<br>
                my father. You are the only man in Rome no one can touch. Live,<br>
                Narcissus Meridas, the citizens of Rome protect you now.</p>
              <p>The Doctor hands Lucilla a damp cloth and while he finishes bandaging 
                the wound leaving a long lamp wick to help it drain, she gets 
                closer and wipes his forehead. The longer she does it the more 
                it becomes a caress.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome.<br>
                But that was something. If it wasn't that, then it was the pay 
                or<br>
                the loot of the next whore -- but that was something! These men 
                here<br>
                are butchered for laughs! Their lives are like jokes delivered 
                in<br>
                the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line!</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men? How like 
                my<br>
                father you are. You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still 
                alive.</p>
              <p>Narcissus grips the Divine by the sleeve.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                When the door is open, I'll be ready to pass through.</p>
              <p>Lucilla looks over at Proximo, then the Doctor. Proximo nods 
                and backs out of the room.</p>
              <p> DOCTOR<br>
                Jove's hands are on him now.</p>
              <p>As Narcissus starts to fade again she gestures them out and they 
                dutifully follow Proximo.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman. Read to 
                sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night. My beautiful<br>
                daughters.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited 
                when we were children? The one that was supposed to remind us 
                we were<br>
                Romans?</p>
              <p>She holds Narcissus' head, daubing away the perspiration<br>
                with the cloth.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                &quot;If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in 
                the tunic,<br>
                then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as 
                the<br>
                thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads.<br>
                But...&quot;</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                &quot;But what if I wish to be purple?&quot;</p>
              <p>They smile recalling the old, childhood words.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS/LUCILLA<br>
                &quot;A small part, which is bright, and makes all the rest appear 
                graceful<br>
                and beautiful.&quot;</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                &quot;Why then do you tell me to make myself like the many?&quot;</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                &quot;For if I do, how shall I still be purple?&quot;</p>
              <p>Now they laugh, finding this connection. But Lucilla knows exactly 
                where she's going.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                &quot;Then when you ask me the question, whether death is preferable 
                of life?<br>
                I say &quot;life.&quot; &quot;Pain or pleasure?&quot;<br>
                I say &quot;pleasure.&quot;</p>
              <p>She kisses him and as best he responds. In the end the best both 
                can do is get close on his blanket.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                You cannot die.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Would that Marcus had lived.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                He killed his father and then my family...</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Narcissus, I have your family.<br>
                They're alive. All of them.</p>
              <p>Narcissus forces himself to sit up -- in fact he tries to stand 
                but just can't.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Where are they?</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Hidden. Where my brother cannot place hands on them. He didn't 
                have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all. The 
                sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.</p>

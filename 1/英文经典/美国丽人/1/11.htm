              <p>EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - a SHORT TIME LATER</p>
              <p>We're now at street level, BACKING down Robin Hood Trail as Lester 
                runs toward us. He carries a WALKMAN and wears EARPHONES, and 
                we HEAR The Beatles singing &quot;BACK IN THE U.S.S.R.&quot; as 
                he runs. The endorphins have kicked in, and Lester grins, reveling 
                in the sheer physical pleasure of his body. </p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - a SHORT TIME LATER</p>
              <p>The blender GRINDS as LESTER, still IN his sweatpants, makeshimself 
                a high-protein shake. He's in excellent shape - even his posture 
                has changed and he moves with the confident, easy swagger of an 
                athlete. Jane watches him blankly from the kitchen table.</p>
              <p>Carolyn enters. By now, she hates Lester so much she won't even 
                look at him. As she rinses out a coffee cup, Lester leans against 
                the counter, drinking his shake directly form the blender pitcher, 
                eyeing her. He's got newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable, 
                and he knows it. Carolyn quickly dries off the coffee cup and 
                starts out.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNJane, Hurry up. I have a very important appointment - 
              </p>
              <p>JANEMom, is it okay if Angela sleeps over tonight?</p>
              <p>Jane looks at Lester to see how he reacts. He doesn't.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNOf course it's okay. She's always welcome here.(on her 
                way out)I thought you and Angela might have had a fight. We haven't 
                seen her in a while.</p>
              <p>And she's gone. Jane continues staring at her father. Finally, 
                he glances over at her.</p>
              <p>JANE(nervous)I've been too embarrassed to invite her over. Because 
                you always hang around when she comes over, and you, you -stare 
                at her all the time, like you're drunk. It's disgusting.</p>
              <p>A beat.</p>
              <p>LESTERIf you don't watch out, you're going to turn into a real 
                bitch, just like your mother.</p>
              <p>JANE is stunned. she quickly rises, trying to get out OF thekitchen 
                before he can see her crying. As she goes, we see the immediate 
                regret in Lester's eyes.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - the same TIME</p>
              <p>RICKY and the COLONEL sit at the table, eating IN silence.Barbara 
                glides back and forth behind them like a ghost. The Colonel glances 
                at the scars on his son's face... and for a moment, we see the 
                depth of his love for this boy. Then Ricky looks up at him, and 
                the Colonel is suddenly self-conscious.</p>
              <p>COLONELHow's your food?</p>
              <p>RICKYIt's good.(then)Oh, Dad. I don't need a ride this morning. 
                I'm going to go in with Jane and her mom.</p>
              <p>COLONEL(startled)Jane?</p>
              <p>RICKYMy girlfriend.</p>
              <p>Just then, BARBARA leans IN, serving bacon out OF a pan.</p>
              <p>RICKY (cont'd)Mom. Bacon?</p>
              <p>BARBARA(cheerful)I know, I remember what you told me, so I made 
                it extra crispy!</p>
              <p>She crosses off. from outside, we HEAR a CAR HORN, and RICKYgets 
                up from the table.</p>
              <p>RICKYGotta go.</p>
              <p>EXT. FITTS HOUSE - front PORCH - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>RICKY emerges from the HOUSE, followed By the COLONEL, whowatches 
                his son as he heads toward the Burnham house.</p>
              <p>His POV: Carolyn waves from the MERCEDES-BENZ ML320, flashingan 
                insincere smile. Jane leans forward from the passenger seat and 
                glares at us. As Ricky starts to get in the car, Lester emerges 
                from the house in his sweatpants.</p>
              <p>LESTERYo, Ricky. How's it going?</p>
              <p>RICKYPretty decent, Mr. Burnham.</p>
              <p>Then RICKY pulls his door shut, But not before LESTER mouthscall 
                me and Ricky gives a slight nod in acknowledgment.</p>
              <p>CLOSE on the Colonel's face: he looks confused.</p>
              <p>His POV: The car backs out of the driveway. Lester yawns, stretches 
                and runs his hands up and down his torso absentmindedly...and 
                then he glances at us, suddenly aware he's being watched. He studies 
                us for a beat, then grins and salutes. He LAUGHS as he turns to 
                go inside the house.</p>
              <p>CLOSE on the Colonel transfixed by what he's just seen, not unlike 
                Lester was when he first saw Angela.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>The door swings open silently and the COLONEL enters. Helooks 
                through the stuff on top of Ricky's bureau then opens the drawers, 
                sifting through clothing inside. He opens the DRAWER in which 
                we know Ricky keeps his stash of marijuana, but he doesn't discover 
                its false bottom. He stands and looks around, his eyes finally 
                landing on:</p>
              <p>A stack of HI-8 VIDEOCASSETTES next to Ricky's computer. </p>
              <p>The COLONEL turns on the TV: we see Matlock, without sound.The 
                Colonel grabs a random VIDEOCASSETTE from the stack, pops it into 
                the VIDEO CAMERA, which is still connected to the TV, and, after 
                examining the camera, presses the play button. On the TV, Matlock 
                suddenly gives way to...</p>
              <p>ON VIDEO: Through the Burnham's GARAGE DOOR WINDOW, we see Lester 
                stepping out of his pants. He then pulls off his briefs, and stands 
                there naked, except for black socks. He grabs some dumbbells and 
                starts lifting them over his head; although he's watching his 
                reflection in the window, it looks like he's watching us as we're 
                watching him...</p>
              <p>The Colonel sinks slowly onto Ricky's bed, mesmerized.</p>
              <p>EXT. parking lot - LATER THAT DAY</p>
              <p>Carolyn walks across a parking lot with Leonard Kane, theReal 
                Estate King.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNYou know, I rarely frequent places like this, but...</p>
              <p>Leonard opens the door OF a BUILDING FOR her.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN (cont'd)I think I can allow myself junk food, after the 
                workout we had this morning.</p>
              <p>She SQUEALS with LAUGHTER as They go inside. the door shutsbehind 
                them. On it we see the SMILEY'S LOGO. </p>
              <p>INT. SMILEY'S - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>A FEW people stand IN line at the counter. Carolyn enterswith 
                Leonard. He whispers something to her and she LAUGHS uproariously.</p>
              <p>IN the KITCHEN, which is separated from the counter By apartition 
                made up of various food service equipment, we see Lester, in a 
                Smiley's uniform and baseball cap, flipping burgers on a grill. 
                He recognizes Carolyn's LAUGH and peers over the partition.</p>
              <p>His POV: Carolyn and Leonard stand at the counter, scanningthe 
                menu overhead. She leans against him affectionately.</p>
              <p>Lester's face darkens, and then... he smiles. He adjusts his 
                cap, and crosses toward the counter.</p>
              <p>CLOSE on Carolyn and Leonard, peering UP at the menu.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNWhat's good here?</p>
              <p>LEONARD(a grin)Nothing.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN(turns to him)Then I guess we'll just have to be bad, 
                won't we?</p>
              <p>And just as they're about to kiss...</p>
              <p>LESTER (O.C.)Smile, you're at Smiley's.</p>
              <p>Carolyn almost jumps out of her skin. She stares at us, startled, 
                and quickly disengages herself from Leonard.</p>
              <p>Her POV: LESTER leers at us, DRIPPING with sarcasm.</p>
              <p>LESTER (cont'd)Would you like to try our new beef and cheese 
                pot pie on a stick, just a dollar ninety nine, for a limited time 
                only?</p>
              <p>Carolyn struggles to appear nonchalant.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN(re: Leonard)We just came from a seminar.(then, all business))Leonard, 
                this is my -</p>
              <p>LESTERHer husband. We've met before, but something tells me you're 
                going [to] remember this time.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNLester, please don't -</p>
              <p>LESTER(loving this)Uh-un, You don't get to tell me what to do. 
                Ever again.</p>
              <p>Carolyn closes her eyes, defeated, then turns and walks out.Leonard 
                glances at Lester, embarrassed, then follows Carolyn.</p>
              <p>LESTER (cont'd)(calls after them)Smile! You're at Smiley's!</p>
              <p>EXT. Top HAT MOTEL _ a SHORT TIME LATER</p>
              <p>The sky is filled with ominous gray clouds, and the windwhips 
                garbage across the parking lot as Carolyn's Mercedes-Benz ML320 
                pulls in next to Leonard's Jaguar.</p>
              <p>INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>The engine is still running. Carolyn sits IN the driverseat, 
                gripping the wheel tightly and staring straight ahead. Leonard 
                looks at her unhappily.</p>
              <p>LEONARDI'm sorry. I just think we should cool it for a while. 
                I'm facing a potentially very expensive divorce.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNOh, no. I understand completely.(sarcastic)In order to 
                be successful, one must project an image of success. At all times.</p>
              <p>She regrets it the second it's out of her mouth, and turns to 
                him. He just looks at her sadly, then gets out of the car and 
                shuts the door. She starts to CRY. As before, she SLAPS herself, 
                hard.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN (cont'd)Stop it. Stop it!</p>
              <p>She closes her eyes tight, trying to STOP the Tears, thensuddenly 
                SCREAMS as loud as she can until she runs out of breath. She opens 
                her eyes, gasping, trying with all her might to overcome this 
                flood of emotion, and then her eyes wander over to...</p>
              <p>Her POV: the closed glove COMPARTMENT. we ZOOM toward itslowly, 
                knowing that's where she keeps her GLOCK 19.</p>
              <p>Carolyn takes a breath, shifts into REVERSE and starts toback 
                out of the motel parking lot just as it starts to RAIN.</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - THAT NIGHT</p>
              <p>Jimi Hendrix's &quot;PURPLE HAZE&quot; blasts from the BOOMBOX 
                as Lester, wearing only sweatpants, does a set of preacher curls 
                with dumbbells. He strains as he finishes his last rep, then puts 
                the weights down and looks at his REFLECTION in the window:</p>
              <p>His POV: his arms are pumped. He smiles.</p>
              <p>He reaches under the exercise BENCH and grabs a CIGAR BOX.Opening 
                it, he digs through ROLLING PAPERS, a PIPE, and other MARIJUANA 
                PARAPHERNALIA, only to pull out an empty ZIP-LOC BAG. He's really 
                not happy about this.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>RICKY sits at the dinette with his mother and father, eatingdinner 
                in silence.</p>
              <p>BARBARA(out of the blue)I'm sorry, what?</p>
              <p>RICKYMom. Nobody said anything.</p>
              <p>BARBARAOh. I'm sorry.</p>
              <p>We HEAR a BEEPING noise. RICKY pulls his BEEPER off his beltand 
                checks it.</p>
              <p>RICKY(getting up)I have to run next door. My girlfriend left 
                her geometry book in my backpack, and she needs it to do her homework.</p>
              <p>He heads into the hall. the COLONEL watches him go, uneasy </p>

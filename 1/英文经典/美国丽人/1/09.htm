              <p>Angela's BMW pulls close to, but not into, the Burnham's driveway. 
                Jane and Ricky climb out, and Angela pulls off, her tires SQUEALING 
                as she goes.</p>
              <p>JANEWhat's her problem?</p>
              <p>RICKYShe doesn't like when you're not totally focused on her.</p>
              <p>They start down the driveway.</p>
              <p>JANE</p>
              <p>So, what's the most beautiful thing you've ever filmed?</p>

              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>Barbara Fitts sits absolutely still at the kitchen table, staring 
                off into space as if hypnotized. Behind her, Ricky enters through 
                the back door, followed by Jane. Barbara doesn't seem to hear 
                them. Ricky quietly takes his VIDEO CAMERA out of his backpack 
                and focuses it on his mother.</p>
              <p>ON VIDEO: We CIRCLE Barbara slowly until we're focused on her 
                face. We stay on her for a long beat, then:</p>
              <p>RICKY (O.C.)Mom(no response)Mom</p>
              <p>ON VIDEO: Barbara's eyes flutter and she turns to us slowly.</p>
              <p>BARBARA(pleasant)Yes?</p>
              <p>RICKY (O.C.)What were you just thinking about?</p>
              <p>BARBARAI...(thinks)No. Nothing.</p>
              <p>RICKY (O.C.)Wow. People study meditation for years to be able 
                to reach that same state of mind.</p>
              <p>BARBARAHuh. What do you know.</p>
              <p>RICKY (O.C.)Mom, I want you to meet somebody. She's standing 
                behind you.</p>
              <p>ON VIDEO: Barbara turns to Jane, who's embarrassed by this.</p>
              <p>RICKY (cont'd)This is Jane.</p>
              <p>BARBARAOh, my. I apologize for the way things look around here.</p>
              <p>On VIDEO: JANE glances around. the KITCHEN is spotless.</p>

              <p>We HEAR KEY TURNING IN the lock, then the door opens andRicky 
                enters, holding a RING OF KEYS, followed by Jane.</p>
              <p>RICKYThis is where my Dad hides out.</p>
              <p>GLASS CASES filled with GUNS line the walls.</p>
              <p>JANEWow. I take it he's got a thing for guns.</p>
              <p>RICKY crosses to a built-IN CABINET behind the desk.</p>
              <p>RICKYYou got to see this one thing...</p>
              <p>He unlocks the CABINET and opens it, revealing shelvesstacked 
                with WAR MEMORABILIA.</p>
              <p>RICKY (cont'd)Man, he would kill me if he knew I was in here...</p>
              <p>JANEDid you steal his keys?</p>
              <p>RICKYNo. One of my clients is a locksmith. He was short on cash 
                so I let him pay me in trade.</p>
              <p>He reaches into the CABINET and carefully removes an ovalCHINA 
                PLATTER which he hands to Jane. She examines it</p>
              <p>RICKY (cont'd)Turn it over.</p>
              <p>CLOSE on the bottom OF the plate: a small SWASTIKA isimprinted 
                in the center, surrounded by GERMAN LETTERING.</p>
              <p>JANEOh my God.</p>
              <p>RICKYIt's like official state china from the Third Reich. There's 
                like this whole subculture of people who collect this Nazi shit. 
                But my dad just has this one thing.</p>
              <p>He puts the platter back into the cabinet and shuts the door, 
                then notices Jane looking at him oddly.</p>
              <p>RICKY (cont'd)What's wrong?</p>
              <p>JANENothing.</p>
              <p>RICKY(concerned)No, you're scared of me.</p>
              <p>JANENo I'm not.</p>
              <p>But she is. RICKY studies her.</p>
              <p>RICKYCome on, let's go to my room</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>RICKY enters, followed By Jane. He shuts the door, thentakes 
                his VIDEO CAMERA out of his backpack. Jane looks around at all 
                the AUDIO/VIDEO EQUIPMENT.</p>
              <p>JANESo let me guess: you want to be, like a movie director or 
                something.</p>
              <p>He doesn't answer, he just starts to videotape her.</p>
              <p>JANE (cont'd)(irritated)Ha. I should have known. You're just 
                like every other dweeb who worships Quentin Tarantino for the 
                same reason you can't let go of that camera: because you don't 
                know how to be a real person in real life. It's so obvious.</p>
              <p>RICKYYou think you're not obvious? You sit in front of your mirror, 
                wondering what it would be like to be beautiful, like Angela. 
                But the truth is, you're more beautiful than she'll ever be. Because 
                you're more real. Because you...</p>
              <p>He starts to SING, IN a clear, deep voice.</p>
              <p>RICKY (cont'd)YOU... LIGHT UP MY LIFE...</p>
              <p>JANE stares at him, unsure whether she should laugh or run.</p>
              <p>RICKY (cont'd)YOU GIVE ME HOPE... TO CARRY ON...</p>
              <p>She Finally LAUGHS. He lowers the camera and smiles.</p>
              <p>RICKY (cont'd)Want to see the most beautiful thing I've ever 
                filmed?</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - LATER</p>
              <p>On VIDEO: were IN an empty parking lot on a cold, gray day.Something 
                is floating across from us... it's an empty, wrinkled, white PLASTIC 
                BAG. We follow it as the wind carries it in a circle around us, 
                sometimes whipping it about violently, or, without warning, sending 
                it soaring skyward, then letting it float gracefully down to the 
                ground...</p>
              <p>Jane sits on the bed. She watches Ricky's WIDE-SCREEN TV, her 
                brow furrowed, trying to figure out why this is beautiful.</p>
              <p>From a chair across the ROOM, RICKY watches, smiling.</p>
              <p>RICKYIt was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing 
                and there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it, 
                right? And this bag was like, dancing with me. Like a little kid 
                begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes. And that's the 
                day I knew there was this entire life behind things, and ... this 
                incredibly benevolent force, that wanted me to know there was 
                no reason to be afraid. Ever.</p>
              <p>A beat.</p>
              <p>RICKY (cont'd)Video's a poor excuse. But it helps me remember... 
                and I need to remember...</p>
              <p>Now JANE is watching him.</p>
              <p>RICKY (cont'd)(distant)Sometimes there's so much beauty in the 
                world I feel like I can't take it, like my heart's going to cave 
                in.</p>
              <p>He points a REMOTE at the TV and switches it off, then justsits 
                there lost in thought, not unlike his mother.</p>
              <p>After a moment, JANE gets up. RICKY watches impassively asshe 
                kneels in front of him and takes his hands and kisses them. Then 
                she leans up and kisses him softly on the lips. His eyes scan 
                hers, curious to see how she reacts to this...</p>
              <p>JANE(suddenly)Oh my God. What time is it?</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>We HEAR Jack Jones singing &quot;YOU'D BETTER LOVE ME.&quot; 
                Lester is seated at the dining table, in a T-shirt and jeans, 
                eating his dinner voraciously and drinking beer from a bottle. 
                Across from him, Carolyn picks at her food, watching him with 
                contempt. He HEAR the back door SLAM, then Jane enters and quickly 
                takes her seat at the table.</p>
              <p>JANESorry I'm late.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNThat's quite all right, dear. Your father and I were just 
                discussing his day at work.(to Lester)Why don't you tell our daughter 
                about it, honey?</p>
              <p>JANE stares at both her parents, apprehensive. LESTER looksat 
                Carolyn darkly, then flashes a &quot;you-asked-for-it&quot; grin.</p>
              <p>LESTERJanie, today I quit my job. I also told my boss to fuck 
                himself, and then blackmailed him for almost sixty-thousand dollars. 
                Pass the asparagus.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNYour father seems to think this kind of behavior is something 
                to be proud of.</p>
              <p>LESTERAnd your mother seems to prefer I go through life like 
                a fucking prisoner while she keeps my dick in a mason jar under 
                the sink.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN(ashen)How dare you speak to me like that in front of 
                her?</p>
              <p>LESTERWill someone please pass me the asparagus?</p>
              <p>CAROLYN(to Lester)I hope you don't think for one minute I'm going 
                to support you</p>
              <p>LESTERI already have another job.</p>
              <p>JANE(risesOkay, guys? I'm not going to be a part of this.</p>
              <p>LESTER(means it)Sit down.</p>
              <p>JANE does So immediately, surprised and intimidated By thepower 
                in her father's voice. Lester gets up, crosses to the other side 
                of the table to get a PLATE OF ASPARAGUS, then sits again as he 
                serves himself.</p>
              <p>LESTER (cont'd)I'm sick of being treated like I don't exist. 
                You both do whatever you want to do, whenever you want to do it 
                and I don't complain. All I want is the same courtesy - </p>
              <p>CAROLYN(overlapping)Do you really think -</p>
              <p>LESTER hurls the plate OF asparagus against the wall withsuch 
                force it SHATTERS, frightening Carolyn and Jane.</p>
              <p>LESTERDon't interrupt me, honey.</p>
              <p>He goes BACK to eating his meal, as if nothing unusual hashappened. 
                Carolyn sits in her chair, shivering with rage. Jane just stares 
                at the plate in front of her. &quot;YOU'D BETTER LOVE ME&quot; 
                continues to play on the STEREO.</p>
              <p>LESTER (cont'd)Oh, and another thing. From now on, we're going 
                to alternate our dinner music. Because frankly, and I don't think 
                I'm alone here, I'm really tired of this Lawrence Welk shit.</p>

              <p>JANEAw, Christ, Mom.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN(tearful)The reason I'm glad is because you're old enough 
                to learn the most important lesson in life: you cannot count on 
                anyone except yourself. It's sad, but the and the sooner you learn

                VIDEO CAMERA, videotaping us. On the WIDE ~ TV behind him, we 
                see Jane standing in her window as she looks across at him. She

                in his hand. Unable to concentrate, he throws the mail down, angry. 
                He sits very still for a moment, some internal struggle obviously 
                taking place, then grabs his KEYS off the desk and turns to unlock

                She's obviously embarrassed, but she's gone this far and there's 
                no turning back. She stands there with her breasts exposed, trying 
                to look defiant, but she's achingly vulnerable. We continue ZOOMING 
                toward her face, as close as we can get to the desperate yearning

              <p>Jane's POV: In the WINDOW across from us, the Colonel proceeds 
                to give Ricky a serious beating, punching his face.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - Continuous</p>
              <p>Ricky's lip is bleeping, but he maintains a clear steady gaze 
                at this father during this violence. </p>
              <p>COLONEL(unnerved)Fight back you little pussy!</p>
              <p>RICKYNo, sir. I won't fight you.</p>
              <p>Gradually, the COLONEL winds down. He lets go OF RICKY andsinks 
                into a chair, breathing hard.</p>
              <p>COLONELHow did you get in there?</p>
              <p>RICKYI picked the lock.</p>
              <p>COLONELWhat were you looking for? Money? Are you on dope again?</p>
              <p>RICKYNo sir. I was showing my girlfriend your Nazi plate.</p>
              <p>A beat.</p>
              <p>COLONELGirlfriend?</p>
              <p>RICKYYes, sir. She lives next door. The Colonel glances toward 
                the window.</p>
              <p>His POV: IN the window across from us, JANE peeks out frombehind 
                the curtain. She quickly pulls it shut.</p>
              <p>RICKY (cont'd)Her name's Jane.</p>
              <p>A beat. the COLONEL is Suddenly, deeply shamed.</p>
              <p>COLONELThis is for your own good, boy. You have no respect for 
                other people's things, for authority, for... anything.</p>
              <p>RICKYI know. I'm sorry.</p>
              <p>COLONELYou need structure, you need discipline - </p>
              <p>RICKY(simultaneous)Discipline. I know. Thank you for trying to 
                teach me.(then)Don't give up on me, Dad.</p>
              <p>The COLONEL, still breathing heavily, regards his son. FORthe 
                briefest moment, we see a flash of tenderness across his face, 
                but then it's gone. He gets up.</p>
              <p>COLONELYou stay out of there.</p>
              <p>He leaves, quickly, glancing BACK toward the window on hisway 
                out. Ricky then gets up and goes into his bathroom, where he starts 
                to calmly wash the blood from his face.</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE' S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>JANE sits on her bed crying, shaken By What she just saw.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - THE COLONEL'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>The COLONEL enters, still breathing heavily, and locks thedoor 
                behind him. He paces for a moment, agitated, then crosses to the 
                built-in CABINET behind his desk and opens it. He removes the 
                Nazi platter and gingerly places it on the desk, then does the 
                same with several other items until he uncovers a small METAL 
                BOX. He sits behind the desk, staring at the box, troubled. He 
                finally opens it.</p>
              <p>ANGLE ON the open box: it's filled with PHOTOGRAPHS. The Colonel 
                pulls one from the bottom of the box...</p>
              <p>CLOSE on the grainy BLACK &amp; WHITE PHOTOGRAPH IN his callusedhands: 
                it's of TWO YOUNG SERVICEMEN standing in front of a Jeep, both 
                shirtless and wearing fatigues. Their muscular arms are draped 
                lazily around each other's shoulders as they grin for the camera. 
                One of these men is the Colonel himself, albeit much younger - 
                almost thirty years younger.</p>
              <p>CLOSE on the Colonel's face as he studies the photo. His breathing 
                has finally relaxed; his face has gone vacant.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
              <p>It's late at night. We're looking down on the Colonel and Barbara 
                in bed. She SNORES softly, but the Colonel is awake, staring straight 
                up at us. After a moment he pushes the covers back, gets out of 
                bed and exits the room noisily, but Barbara is sleeping the sleep 
                of the dead and doesn't wake.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>The COLONEL enters, agitated. He flips on the LIGHTS, thenopens 
                the refrigerator, scans its contents, and closes the door without 
                having noticed what was inside. He paces around the kitchen, then 
                stops in his tracks when he sees:</p>
              <p>His POV: Through the window over the sink, we can see Throughthe 
                GARAGE DOOR WINDOW of the Burnham house next door. Inside the 
                garage, Lester, wearing only briefs, stands doing shoulder presses. 
                His upper body, glistening in sweat, is pumped.</p>
              <p>The COLONEL quickly crosses to the light switch and switchesthe 
                LIGHTS OFF. He stands absolutely still for a moment, then drags 
                a chair from the kitchen table over to the sink and sits in the 
                dark, watching Lester.</p>
              <p>FADE to BLACK.</p>
              <p>IN darkness, we HEAR repetitive GUNSHOTS.</p>
              <p>FADE IN:</p>
              <p>INT. INDOOR FIRING RANGE - DAY</p>
              <p>Carolyn, wearing PROTECTIVE HEADGEAR, is holding a GLOCK 19 AUTOMATIC 
                REVOLVER with both hands, FIRING it directly at us.</p>
              <p>A DIFFERENT ANGLE reveals she is at an INDOOR FIRING range.She 
                empties a round and stands there, exhilarated by the experience. 
                An ATTENDANT approaches with a new round of ammunition.</p>
              <p>ATTENDANT(loading gun)I gotta say, Mrs. Burnham, when you first 
                came in here, I thought you would be hopeless. But you're a natural.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNWell, all I know is...</p>
              <p>She starts FIRING again.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN (cont'd)I love shooting this gun!</p>

              <p>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>ON VIDEO: We're across from Jane's window, peering in. Jane tries 
                to shut the drapes, but Angela won't let her. Irritated, Jane 
                retreats into the room. We ZOOM toward her, even as Angela poses 
                in the window, waving, but we're clearly not interested in Angela. 
                The ZOOM continues, searching for Jane, who has disappeared. Finally, 
                we settle on the full-length MIRROR on the open closet door, where 
                we see a REFLECTION of Jane, back at her computer. She's smiling.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>RICKY sits IN darkness with his VIDEO camera, videotapingthrough 
                the open window. He lowers his camera and smiles... then something 
                below catches his attention. He leans out the window to get better 
                look at:</p>
              <p>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE -GARAGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>Ricky's POV: Through a WINDOW on the front of the Burnham's GARAGE 
                DOOR, we see Lester, still in his suit, digging through shelves 
                against the back wall. </p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>LESTER pulls aside old board games, badminton racquets, andstrings 
                of Christmas lights, searching for something as if his very life 
                depended on it. </p>
              <p>LESTERShit. Shit!</p>
              <p>Then He yanks aside a box OF wallpaper scrap, and his facelights 
                up at what he finds:</p>
              <p>A pair OF DUMBBELLS, obviously unused FOR many years.</p>
              <p>LESTER rips off his jacket and tie and unbuttons his shirt.He 
                glances around, finding his REFLECTION in the WINDOW as he pulls 
                off his shirt, then the T-shirt underneath.</p>
              <p>He eyes himself critically: Angela was right, he's not in bad 
                shape. Naturally broad-shouldered, with just a few extra pounds 
                around his middle that wouldn't be hard to shed. He kicks off 
                his shoes and begins to step out of his pants.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>RICKY holds his camera UP and starts to videotape.</p>
              <p>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>Ricky's POV, on VIDEO: Through the GARAGE DOOR WINDOW, we see 
                Lester stepping out of his pants. He then pulls off his briefs, 
                and stands there naked, except for black socks. He grabs the dumbbells 
                and starts lifting them over his head; although he's watching 
                his reflection in the window, it looks like he's watching us as 
                we're watching him...</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>RICKY stands at the open window, videotaping.</p>
              <p>RICKYWelcome to America's Weirdest Home Videos.</p>
              <p>Suddenly we HEAR someone trying to open the door from theother 
                side - it's locked.</p>
              <p>COLONEL (O.C.)Ricky!</p>
              <p>MOVING swiftly, RICKY pulls the drapes shut and switches on alight. 
                His room is a haven of high-tech. A state-of-the-art multimedia 
                COMPUTER crowds his desk, and high-end STEREO and VIDEO EQUIPMENT 
                line the shelves, as well as HUNDREDS OF CDs. There is easily 
                twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in this room.</p>
              <p>RICKYComing, Dad.</p>
              <p>COLONEL (O.C.)You know I don't like locked doors in my house, 
                boy.</p>
              <p>RICKY grabs a REMOTE and switches on his wide-screen TV justbefore 
                he opens the door.</p>
              <p>RICKYI must have locked it by accident, sorry. So what's up?</p>
              <p>The COLONEL holds out a small PLASTIC CUP with a CAP.</p>
              <p>COLONELI need a urine sample.</p>
              <p>RICKYWow. Is it six months already? Can I give it to you in the 
                morning? I just took a whiz.</p>
              <p>The Colonel doesn't respond. His eyes are focused on:</p>
              <p>On the TV: the shower scene from Top Gun plays. Seminudeyoung 
                MALE BODIES, artfully lit.</p>
              <p>COLONELWhat the hell is that?</p>
              <p>RICKY turns to the TV.</p>
              <p>RICKYTop Gun. It's about pilot training in the Air Force. You 
                never saw it?</p>
              <p>The COLONEL shakes his head, eyes glued to the screen.</p>
              <p>RICKY (cont'd)Oh, you would love this movie, Dad. Want to watch 
                it with me?</p>
              <p>The COLONEL looks at him sharply, then:</p>
              <p>COLONELNo.</p>
              <p>He quickly walks down the hall. RICKY smiles, shuts andlocks 
                his door. He puts the plastic cup on the shelf, then crosses to 
                a MINI REFRIGERATOR in the corner of his room and opens it. He 
                takes out a cup-sized TUPPERWARE CONTAINER from the freezer, already 
                filled with urine, albeit frozen, and places it on a saucer to 
                thaw overnight. </p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT</p>
              <p>Carolyn lies sleeping; Lester is awake, staring at the ceiling. 
                After a moment, he gets up taking care not to disturb Carolyn, 
                and walks toward the bathroom.</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>LESTER enters and switches on the LIGHT. the ROOM is filledwith 
                STEAM. Lester looks around, confused, then focuses on:</p>
              <p>His POV: across from us, IN a PEDESTAL BATHTUB, is Angela.She 
                smiles and beckons us, and we MOVE CLOSER. ROSE PETALS float on 
                the surface of the water, obscuring her naked body.</p>
              <p>ANGELAI've been waiting for you.</p>
              <p>LESTER kneels By the BATHTUB like a MAN IN church. ANGELAreaches 
                out and feels his biceps.</p>
              <p>ANGELA (cont'd)Oh! You've been working out, haven't you? I can 
                tell.</p>
              <p>She arches her BACK, and her breasts protrude Through thesurface 
                of the water. She looks up at Lester.</p>
              <p>ANGELA (cont'd)I was hoping you'd give me a bath... I'm very, 
                very dirty.</p>
              <p>LESTER gives her a hard look, then slowly slips his hand intothe 
                water between her legs. Her eyes widen and she throws her head 
                back... and we SMASH CUT TO:</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE 0- MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>CLOSE on Carolyn, her eyes wide, listening to the rhythmicBRUSH 
                of Lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers.</p>
              <p>She flips over and faces him.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNWhat are you doing?</p>
              <p>A beat.</p>
              <p>LESTERWhat does it look like I'm doing? I'm whacking off.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNWhat?!</p>
              <p>She switches on the bedside light and gets out OF bed.Lester 
                LAUGHS.</p>
              <p>LESTERSpanking the monkey. Flogging the bishop. Choking the chicken. 
                Jerking the gherkin.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNHow disgusting.</p>
              <p>LESTEROh. Well, forgive me, but I still have blood pumping through 
                my veins!</p>
              <p>A beat. Carolyn sits IN a chair across the ROOM from him.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNLester. I refuse to live like this. This is not a marriage.</p>
              <p>LESTERThis hasn't been a marriage for years. But you were perfectly 
                happy as long as I kept my mouth shut. Well, guess what? I've 
                changed. And the new me whacks off when he feels horny, because 
                you're obviously not going to help me out in that department.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN(furious)Don't mess with me, mister, or I will divorce 
                you so fast it'll make your head spin!LESTEROn what grounds? I'm 
                not a drunk, I don't fuck other women, I've never hit you, or 
                mistreated you, or even tried to touch you since you made it clear 
                just how unnecessary you consider me to be. But. I did support 
                you while you got your license. And some people might think that 
                entitles me to half of what's yours.</p>
              <p>She's stunned - it's clear he knows where she's most vulnerable. 
                He sees this, and likes it; it feels good to win for a change. 
                He curls up under the covers contentedly.</p>
              <p>LESTER (cont'd)Turn the light off when you come to bed, okay?</p>
              <p>Carolyn just sits there, staring at him with absolute hatred.</p>
              <p>FADE to BLACK.</p>
              <p>FADE IN:</p>

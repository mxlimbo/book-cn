              <p>INT. ANGELA'S BMW - THE SAME TIME</p>
              <p>It's now RAINING HARD outside. The Smithereens' &quot;BLOOD AND 
                ROSES&quot; BLASTS from the STEREO. Angela drives, squinting through 
                the windshield as the wipers move back and forth.</p>
              <p>ANGELASo you and psycho boy are fucking on a regular basis now, 
                right?</p>
              <p>JANE(irritable)No.</p>
              <p>ANGELAOh, come on. You can tell me. Does he have a big dick?</p>
              <p>JANELook, I don't want to talk about his dick with you. It's 
                not like that.</p>
              <p>ANGELANot like what? Doesn't he have one?(then)Jane, don't be 
                a sap and fall for the first guy you have sex with. That is so 
                stupid.</p>
              <p>JANEYou know what's stupid? Only fucking people because you think 
                it'll get you something! That's pathetic.</p>
              <p>ANGELA rolls her eyes.</p>
              <p>ANGELAWe gotta get you a real man.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>The COLONEL stands at the sink, rinsing off his dinner plate.Something 
                outside catches his eye, and he cranes his neck to get a better 
                look at...</p>
              <p>His POV: Through the window over the sink, we can see intothe 
                Burnham's GARAGE DOOR WINDOW. Our view is slightly blurred by 
                the pouring RAIN, but we see Lester, walking back and forth. his 
                upper body pumped and glistening in sweat as he counts out a wad 
                of BILLS... and then Ricky walks into view.</p>
              <p>The Colonel's face tightens.</p>
              <p>His POV: LESTER drapes his arm around RICKY as He gives himthe 
                money.</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>RICKY, his hair wet from the rain, puts the cash IN hispocket. 
                Lester's arm remains draped around his shoulder.</p>
              <p>LESTERWanna smoke some now?</p>
              <p>RICKYI ought to get back home.</p>
              <p>LESTERAw, come on. Just one...</p>
              <p>RICKY(grins)Got any papers?</p>
              <p>LESTERCigar box, under the bench.(laughs)Dude! Put up a fight! 
                You are a total pushover.</p>
              <p>And He SLAPS RICKY playfully on the chest.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>The Colonel's POV: Lester lets go of Ricky and dances around 
                goofily, still laughing. Ricky sits on the bench and bends over 
                to reach under it. From our perspective, it looks like he's untying 
                his shoes.</p>
              <p>The COLONEL watches, incredulous. then we HEAR a CARAPPROACHING, 
                and the Colonel glances over at:</p>
              <p>His POV: Angela's BMW pulls into the driveway, stopping behind 
                Lester's GTO. As Angela and Jane get out and run toward the house, 
                our focus MOVES back to the GARAGE DOOR WINDOW. Lester, hearing 
                the car door SLAM, looks panicked. He says something to Ricky. 
                Ricky stands and shrugs. Lester pulls on his T-shirt and both 
                he and Ricky cross out of view.</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>JANE and ANGELA enter Through the front door, wet from thepouring 
                rain, arguing.</p>
              <p>ANGELAApparently, dating a psycho makes you totally lose your 
                sense of humor.</p>
              <p>JANEYeah, well, apparently, fucking everything that walks turns 
                you into a total bitch.</p>
              <p>They head BACK toward the kitchen.</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>LESTER holds the BACK door open as RICKY leaves.</p>
              <p>LESTERThanks</p>
              <p>RICKYAnytime</p>
              <p>LESTER closes the door, crosses to the refrigerator and grabsa 
                beer. Jane and Angela enter. Jane frowns when she sees him.</p>
              <p>JANEWhere's Mom?</p>
              <p>LesterDon't know.</p>
              <p>ANGELAHi, Mr. Burnham.</p>
              <p>LESTERHi.</p>
              <p>He's trying to remain cool, and doing a pretty good job.</p>
              <p>ANGELAWow. Look at you. Have you been working out?</p>
              <p>LESTERSome.</p>
              <p>JANE rolls her eyes and exits. ANGELA walks over to Lester.</p>
              <p>ANGELAWell, you can really tell. Look at those arms.</p>
              <p>She places her hand on his arm flirtatiously, looks UP at himand 
                smiles, fully expecting to intimidate him by doing so. But something 
                has changed, and he isn't intimidated at all. He looks directly 
                back at her, leans in and smiles slowly.</p>
              <p>LESTERYou like muscles?</p>
              <p>His voice is low and intense, and the moment is charged witherotic 
                tension.</p>
              <p>ANGELA(unnerved)Uh, sure. I guess.</p>
              <p>She moves away, Suddenly insecure.</p>
              <p>ANGELA (cont'd)I - I should probably go see what Jane's up to.</p>
              <p>And she heads out quickly. Lester watches her go, bewildered.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>RICKY enters, wet from the pouring rain, and crosses to hisbureau, 
                pulling the wad of CASH out of his pocket as he goes.</p>
              <p>COLONEL (O.C.)Where'd you get that?</p>
              <p>RICKY turns, startled.</p>
              <p>His POV: The Colonel steps out of the shadows. He's staring at 
                us, his eyes blazing.</p>
              <p>RICKY takes a step back.</p>
              <p>RICKYFrom my job.</p>
              <p>COLONELDon't lie to me. I saw you with that faggot next door.</p>
              <p>RICKY(incredulous)What? Are you spying on me?</p>
              <p>COLONELWhat did he make you do?</p>
              <p>RICKYDad, you don't really think I... me and Mr. Burnham?</p>
              <p>He LAUGHS.</p>
              <p>COLONEL(furious)Don't you laugh at me!</p>
              <p>And He BACKHANDS RICKY So hard it sends the boy sprawling.</p>
              <p>COLONEL (cont'd)I will not sit back and watch my only son become 
                a cocksucker!</p>
              <p>RICKYJesus Christ! What is it with you and gays? You're like, 
                obsessed -</p>
              <p>The COLONEL grabs RICKY By the throat and screams into hisface.</p>
              <p>COLONELShut up! I'm not the one going next door to meet my &quot;girlfriend!&quot;</p>
              <p>RICKYDad, you've got it all wrong - </p>
              <p>COLONELI swear to God, I'll throw you out of this house and never 
                look at you again.</p>
              <p>RICKY(taken aback)You really mean that?</p>
              <p>COLONELDamn straight I do. I'd rather you were dead than be a 
                fucking faggot.</p>
              <p>A beat. RICKY Suddenly smiles.</p>
              <p>RICKYYou're right. I suck dick for money. Look at this, two thousand 
                dollars. I'm that good.</p>
              <p>The COLONEL pushes RICKY away from him IN disgust.</p>
              <p>COLONELGet out.</p>
              <p>RICKYAnd you should see me fuck. I'm the best piece of ass in 
                three states.</p>
              <p>COLONEL(explodes)Get out!! I don't ever want to see you again!!</p>
              <p>Ricky stands there, eyeing the Colonel. He's finally discovered 
                a way to break free from his father, and he can't believe it was 
                this simple.</p>
              <p>RICKYWhat a sad old man you are.</p>
              <p>He grabs his backpack, turns and walks out the door, leavingthe 
                Colonel standing there, glassy-eyed and breathing heavily.</p>

                long period of time. Ricky enters from the hall.RICKYMom leaving.</p>
              <p>BARBARAOkay, wear a raincoat.</p>
              <p>RICKY(hugs her)I wish things had been better for you. Take care 
                of Dad.</p>
              <p>Frightened, Barbara looks into his face, sensing something's 
                up. He kisses her cheek softly, then exits out the back door, 
                leaving her standing alone in the middle of the room, clutching 
                her dish.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>The Colonel's POV: Below us, Ricky dashes through the rain to 
                the Burnham's aback door and knocks. After a moment, Lester opens 
                it and lets him in.</p>
              <p>EXT. FITTS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>The Colonel looks coldly down at us from Ricky's bedroom window, 
                and then he pulls the drapes shut.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>BARBARA still stands IN the middle OF the ROOM, clutching herdish. 
                The Colonel enters, opens a cabinet and takes out a BOTTLE OF 
                BOURBON. His hands shake as he pours himself a shot. He sits at 
                the table and drinks.</p>

              <p>JANEJust don't fuck my dad, okay?' Please? It's too weird. I 
                don't think we could be friends anymore.</p>
              <p>ANGELAWhy not?</p>
              <p>There is a KNOCK on the door. JANE sits UP, alarmed.</p>
              <p>JANE(angry)Dad! Leave us alone!</p>
              <p>RICKY (O.C.)It's me.</p>

              <p>ANGELAYou guys can't be serious.(to Jane)You're just a kid. And 
                he's like, a mental case. You'll end up living in a box on the 
                street.</p>
              <p>JANEI'm no more a kid than you are. Just because you've fucked 
                way more people than I have. And we can use my plastic surgery 
                money.</p>
              <p>RICKYWe won't have to. I have over forty thousand dollars. And 
                I know people in the city, they can help us get set up.</p>

                And you know it.</p>

              <p>We're MOVING SLOWLY toward the Burnham's GARAGE DOOR WINDOW through 
                the. RAIN. Through the window, we see Lester, wearing only his 
                sweatpants, performing bench presses.</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>Through the window, we see the COLONEL, standing outside INthe

                transfixed.</p>
              <p>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>His POV: LESTER finishes his last rep, straining, then racksthe 
                weights and sits up, sweaty and out of breath. He lights a half 
                finished JOINT and inhales deeply, running his free hand over 
                his chest... and then he glances at us, suddenly aware he's being 
                watched.</p>

                of THUNDER. We're directly outside the GARAGE DOOR as it slowly 
                lifts to reveal Lester smiling at us.</p>
              <p>LESTERJesus, man. You're soaked.</p>

                seems preoccupied, slightly disoriented.</p>
              <p>LESTERYou want me to get Ricky? He's up in Jane's room.</p>
              <p>The COLONEL just stands there, looking at Lester.</p>

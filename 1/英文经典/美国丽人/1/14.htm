                RED FRONT DOOR...</p>
              <p>A REVERSE ANGLE reveals Carolyn, walking slowly toward us, drenched 
                to the bone, clutching her PURSE tightly.</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.)And they're not the ones you'd expect, either...</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT</p>
              <p>RICKY comes down the stairs, followed By Jane. Findingnothing 
                in the family room, he starts toward the kitchen.</p>
              <p>Ricky's POV: Through the doorway, we see a slowly spreading POOL 
                OF BLOOD on the WHITE TILE FLOOR beyond. MOVING closer, we see 
                Lester's lifeless arm splayed across the floor, and a .44MAGNUM 
                REVOLVER positioned on the floor next to it.</p>
              <p>RICKY stares wide-eyed, But not afraid. behind him, JANEstands 
                shaking, in shock.</p>
              <p>JANEOh God...</p>
              <p>Ricky kneels next to the body, gazing reverently at what's left 
                of Lester's face. A woman's high-pitched SCREAM suddenly cuts 
                through the silence. Ricky looks up at:</p>
              <p>His POV: Carolyn stands in the doorway to the dining room, soaking 
                wet, still clutching her PURSE.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN(ashen)My kitchen...</p>
              <p>Just then, we HEAR another high-pitched SCREAM:</p>
              <p>ANGELA stands IN the doorway to the FAMILY ROOM, holdingherself 
                tightly. She starts to cry.</p>
              <p>The pool of BLOOD spreads closer to the .44 MAGNUM. Ricky picks 
                the gun up and moves it across the floor.</p>
              <p>RICKY(after a beat)Man, I wish I had my video camera.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - COLONEL' S STUDY - NIGHT</p>
              <p>The Colonel enters, still wet. He's wearing LATEX GLOVES. Flecks 
                of BLOOD cover the front of his T-shirt. He paces nervously in 
                front of one of his GUN CASES; the GLASS DOOR is open, and a gun 
                is conspicuously missing from inside. The Colonel suddenly looks 
                down at the BLOOD on his T-shirt. He pulls the shirt off and wads 
                it into a ball.</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.)The moments you remember are tiny ones, some you 
                haven't thought of in years...</p>

                the door and locks it, then takes the GLOCK 19 out of her purse 
                and shoves it into the LAUNDRY HAMPER, pushing it far down underneath 
                the dirty clothes.</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.)If you've thought of them at all...</p>

                Fleishman, whom we recognize from the beginning1 questions Angela, 
                who can't stop crying.</p>

                saw earlier, of him and the other young serviceman standing in 
                the front of a Jeep. It CRACKLES and blackens, and then it's gone.</p>
              <p>The Colonel sits in a leather wing chair by the fireplace, staring

                it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about violently, 
                or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward, then letting 
                it float gracefully down to the ground...</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.)I guess I could be pretty pissed of f about what 
                happened to me... but it's hard to stay mad, when there's so much 
                beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at 
                once, and it's too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that's 
                about to burst...</p>

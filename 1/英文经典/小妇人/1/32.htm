              <br>
              &quot;Jo, I'm anxious about Beth.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, Mother, she has seemed unusually well since the babies 
              came.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;It's not her health that troubles me now, it's her spirits. 
              I'm sure there is something on her mind, and I want you to discover 
              what it is.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;What makes you think so, Mother?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;She sits alone a good deal, and doesn't talk to her father 
              as much as she used. I found her crying over the babies the other 
              day. When she sings, the songs are always sad ones, and now and 
              then I see a look in her face that I don't understand. This isn't 
              like Beth, and it worries me.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Have you asked her about it?' </p>
            <p>&quot;I have tried once or twice, but she either evaded my questions 
              or looked so distressed that I stopped. I never force my children's 
              confidence, and I seldom have to wait for long.&quot; </p>
            <p>Mrs. March glanced at Jo as she spoke, but the face opposite seemed 
              quite unconscious of any secret disquietude but Beth's, and after 
              sewing thoughtfully for a minute, Jo said, &quot;I think she is 
              growing up, and so begins to dream dreams, and have hopes and fears 
              and fidgets, without knowing why or being able to explain them. 
              Why, Mother, Beth's eighteen, but we don't realize it, and treat 
              her like a child, forgetting she's a woman.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;So she is. Dear heart, how fast you do grow up,&quot; returned 
              her mother with a sigh and a smile. </p>
            <p>&quot;Can't be helped, Marmee, so you must resign yourself to all 
              sorts of worries, and let your birds hop out of the nest, one by 
              one. I promise never to hop very far, if that is any comfort to 
              you.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;It's a great comfort, Jo. I always feel strong when you are 
              at home, now Meg is gone. Beth is too feeble and Amy too young to 
              depend upon, but when the tug comes, you are always ready.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, you know I don't mind hard jobs much, and there must 
              always be one scrub in a family. Amy is splendid in fine works and 
              I'm not, but I feel in my element when all the carpets are to be 
              taken up, or half the family fall sick at once. Amy is distinguishing 
              herself abroad, but if anything is amiss at home, I'm your man.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I leave Beth to your hands, then, for she will open her tender 
              little heart to her Jo sooner than to anyone else. Be very kind, 
              and don't let her think anyone watches or talks about; her. If she 
              only would get quite strong and cheerful again, I shouldn't have 
              a wish in the world.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Happy woman! I've got heaps.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;My dear, what are they?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll settle Bethy's troubles, and then I'll tell you mine. 
              They are not very wearing, so they'll keep.&quot; And Jo stitched 
              away, with a wise nod which set her mother's heart at rest about 
              her for the present at least. </p>
            <p>While apparently absorbed in her own affairs, Jo watched Beth, 
              and after many conflicting conjectures, finally settled upon one 
              which seemed to explain the change in her. A slight incident gave 
              Jo the clue to the mystery, she thought, and lively fancy, loving 
              heart did the rest. She was affecting to write busily one Saturday 
              afternoon, when she and Beth were alone together. Yet as she scribbled, 
              she kept her eye on her sister, who seemed unusually quiet. Sitting 
              at the window, Beth's work often dropped into her lap, and she leaned 
              her head upon her hand, in a dejected attitude, while her eyes rested 
              on the dull, autumnal landscape. Suddenly some one passed below, 
              whistling like an operatic blackbird, and a voice called out, &quot;All 
              serene! Coming in tonight.&quot; </p>
            <p>Beth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the passer-by 
              till his quick tramp died away, then said softly as if to herself, 
              &quot;How strong and well and happy that dear boy looks.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;Hum!&quot; said Jo, still intent upon her sister's face, 
              for the bright color faded as quickly as it came, the smile vanished, 
              and presently a tear lay shining on the window ledge. Beth whisked 
              it off, and in her half-averted face read a tender sorrow that made 
              her own eyes fill. Fearing to betray herself, she slipped away, 
              murmuring something about needing more paper.</p>
            <p>&quot;Mercy on me, Beth loves Laurie!&quot; she said, sitting down 
              in her own room, pale with the shock of the discovery which she 
              believed she had just made. &quot;I never dreamed of such a thing. 
              What will Mother say? I wonder if her...&quot; there Jo stopped 
              and turned scarlet with a sudden thought. &quot;If he shouldn't 
              love back again, how dreadful it would be. He must. I'll make him!&quot; 
              And she shook her head threateningly at the picture of the mischievous- 
              looking boy laughing at her from the wall. &quot;Oh dear, we are 
              growing up with a vengeance. Here's Meg married and a mamma, Amy 
              flourishing away at Paris, and Beth in love. I'm the only one that 
              has sense enough to keep out of mischief.&quot; Jo thought intently 
              for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture, then she smoothed 
              out her wrinkled forehead and said, with a decided nod at the face 
              opposite, &quot;No thank you, sir, you're very charming, but you've 
              no more stability than a weathercock. So you needn't write touching 
              notes and smile in that insinuating way, for it won't do a bit of 
              good, and I won't have it.&quot; </p>
            <p>Then she sighed, and fell into a reverie from which she did not 
              wake till the early twilight sent her down to take new observations, 
              which only confirmed her suspicion. Though Laurie flirted with Amy 
              and joked with Jo, his manner to Beth had always been peculiarly 
              kind and gentle, but so was everybody's. Therefore, no one thought 
              of imagining that he cared more for her than for the others. Indeed, 
              a general impression had prevailed in the family of late that `our 
              boy' was getting fonder than ever of Jo, who, however, wouldn't 
              hear a word upon the subject and scolded violently if anyone dared 
              to suggest it. If they had known the various tender passages which 
              had been nipped in the bud, they would have had the immense satisfaction 
              of saying, &quot;I told you so.&quot; But Jo hated `philandering', 
              and wouldn't allow it, always having a joke or a smile ready at 
              the least sign of impending danger. When Laurie first went to college, 
              he fell in love about once a month, but these small flames were 
              as brief as ardent, did no damage, and much amused Jo, who took 
              great interest in the alternations of hop, despair, and resignation, 
              which were confided to her in their weekly conferences. But there 
              came a time when Laurie ceased to worship at many shrines, hinted 
              darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged occasionally in 
              Byronic fits of gloom. Then he avoided the tender subject altogether, 
              wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious, and gave out that 
              he was going to `dig', intending to graduate in a blaze of glory. 
              This suited the young lady better than twilight confidences, tender 
              pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the eye, for with 
              Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she preferred imaginary 
              heroes to real ones, because when tired of them, the former could 
              be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter were 
              less manageable. </p>
            <p>Things were in this state when the grand discovery was made, and 
              Jo watched Laurie that night as she had never done before. If she 
              had not got the new idea into her head, she would have seen nothing 
              unusual in the fact that Beth was very quiet, and Laurie very kind 
              to her. But having given the rein to her lively fancy, it galloped 
              away with her at a great pace, and common sense, being rather weakened 
              by a long course or romance writing, did not come to the rescue. 
              As usual Beth lay on the sofa and Laurie sat in a low chair close 
              by, amusing her with all sorts of gossip, for she depended on her 
              weekly `spin', and he never disappointed her. But that evening Jo 
              fancied that Beth's eyes rested on the lively, dark face beside 
              her with peculiar pleasure, and that she listened with intense interest 
              to an account of some exciting cricket match, though the phrases, 
              `caught off a tice', `stumped off his ground'', and `the leg hit 
              for three', were as intelligible to her as Sanskrit. She also fancied, 
              having set her heart upon seeing it, that she saw a certain increase 
              of gentleness in Laurie's manner, that he dropped his voice now 
              and then, laughed less than usual, was a little absent--minded, 
              and settled the afghan over Beth's feet with an assiduity that was 
              really almost tender. </p>
            <p>&quot;Who knows? Stranger things have happened,&quot; thought Jo, 
              as she fussed about the room. &quot;She will make quite an angel 
              of him, and he will make life delightfully easy and pleasant for 
              the dear, if they only love each other. I don't see how he can help 
              it, and I do believe he would if the rest of us were out of the 
              way.&quot; </p>
            <p>As everyone was out of the way but herself, Jo began to feel that 
              she ought to dispose of herself with all speed. But where should 
              she go? And burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion, 
              she sat down to settle that point. </p>
            <p>Now, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa--long, broad, 
              well-cushioned, and low, a trifle shabby, as well it might be, for 
              the girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies, fished over the 
              back, rode on the arms, and had menageries under it as children, 
              and rested tired heads, dreamed dreams, and listened to tender talk 
              on it as young women. They all loved it, for it was a family refuge, 
              and one corner had always been Jo's favorite lounging place. Among 
              the many pillows that adorned the venerable couch was one, hard, 
              round, covered with prickly horsehair, and furnished with a knobby 
              button at each end. This repulsive pillow was her especial property, 
              being used as a weapon of defense, a barricade, or a stern preventive 
              of too much slumber. </p>
            <p>Laurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with deep 
              aversion, having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former days 
              when romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it from 
              the seat he most coveted next ot Jo in the sofa corner. If `the 
              sausage' as the called it, stood on end, it was a sign that he might 
              approach and repose, but if it lay flat across the sofa, woe to 
              man, woman, or child who dared disturb it! That evening Jo forgot 
              to barricade her corner, and had not been in her seat five minutes, 
              before a massive form appeared beside her, and with both arms spread 
              over the sofa back, both long legs stretched out before him, Laurie 
              exclaimed, with a sigh of satisfaction... </p>
            <p>&quot;Now, this is filling at the price.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No slang,&quot; snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow. But 
              it was too late, there was no room for it, and coasting onto the 
              floor, it disappeared in a most mysterious manner. </p>
            <p>&quot;Come, Jo, don't be thorny. After studying himself to a skeleton 
              all the week, a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Beth will pet you. I'm busy.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, she's not to be bothered with me, but you like that sort 
            </p>
            <p>of thing, unless you've suddenly lost your taste for it. Have you? 
            </p>
            <p>Do you hate your boy, and want to fire pillows at him?&quot; </p>
            <p>Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom 
              heard, but Jo quenched `her boy' by turning on him with a stern 
              query, &quot;How many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Not one, upon my word. She's engaged. Now then.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm glad of it, that's one of your foolish extravagances, 
              sending flowers and things to girls for whom you don't care two 
              pins,&quot; continued Jo reprovingly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Sensible girls for whom I do care whole papers of pins won't 
              let me send them `flowers and things', so what can I do? My feelings 
              need a` vent'.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Mother doesn't approve of flirting even in fun, and you do 
              flirt desperately, Teddy.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'd give anything if I could answer, `So do you'. As I can't, 
              I'll merely say that I don't see any harm in that pleasant little 
              game, if all parties understand that it's only play.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, it does look pleasant, but I can't learn how it's done. 
              I've tried, because one feels awkward in company not to do as everybody 
              else id doing, but I don't seem to get on&quot;, said Jo, forgetting 
              to play mentor. </p>
            <p>&quot;Take lessons of Amy, she has a regular talent for it.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Yes, she does it very prettily, and never seems to go too 
              far. I suppose it's natural to some people to please without trying, 
              and others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm glad you can't flirt. It's really refreshing to see a 
              sensible, straightforward girl, who can be jolly and kind without 
              making a fool of herself. Between ourselves, Jo, some of the girls 
              I know really do go on at such a rate I'm ashamed of them. They 
              don't mean any harm, I'm sure, but if they knew how we fellows talked 
              about them afterward, they'd mend their ways, I fancy.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;They do the same, and as their tongues are the sharpest, 
              you fellows get the worst of it, for you are as silly as they, every 
              bit. If you behaved properly, they would, but knowing you like their 
              nonsense, they keep it up, and then you blame them.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Much you know about it, ma'am,&quot; said Laurie in a superior 
              tone. &quot;We don't like romps and flirts, though we may act as 
              if we did sometimes. The pretty, modest girls are never talked about, 
              except respectfully, among gentleman. Bless your innocent soul! 
              If you could be in my place for a month you'd see things that would 
              astonish you a trifle. Upon my word, when I see one of those harum-scarum 
              girls, I always want to say with our friend Cock Robin... </p>
            <p>&quot;Out upon you, fie upon you, Bold-faced jig!&quot; </p>
            <p>It was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between 
              Laurie's chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind, and his 
              very natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable 
              society showed him many samples. Jo knew that `young Laurence' was 
              regarded as a most eligible parti by worldly mamas, was much smiled 
              upon by their daughters, and flattered enough by ladies of all ages 
              to make a coxcomb of him, so she watched him rather jealously, fearing 
              he would be spoiled, and rejoiced more than she confessed to find 
              that he still believed in modest girls. Returning suddenly to her 
              admonitory tone, she said, dropping her voice, &quot;If you must 
              have a `went', Teddy, go and devote yourself to one of the `pretty, 
              modest girls' whom you do respect, and not waste your time with 
              the silly ones.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You really advise it?&quot; And Laurie looked at her with 
              an odd mixture of anxiety and merriment in his face. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, I do, but you'd better wait till you are through college, 
              on the whole, and be fitting yourself for the place meantime. You're 
              not half good enough for--well, whoever the modest girl may be.&quot; 
              And Jo looked a little queer likewise, for a name had almost escaped 
              her. </p>
            <p>&quot;That I'm not!&quot; acquiesced Laurie, with an expression 
              of humility quite new to him, as he dropped his eyes and absently 
              wound Jo's apron tassel round his finger. </p>
            <p>&quot;Mercy on us, this will never do,&quot; thought Jo, adding 
              aloud, &quot;Go and sing to me. I'm dying for some music, and always 
              like yours.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'd rather stay here, thank you.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, you can't, there isn't room. Go and make yourself useful, 
              since you are too big to be ornamental. I thought you hated to be 
              tied to a woman's apron string?&quot; retorted Jo, quoting certain 
              rebellious words of his own. </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah, that depends on who wears the apron!&quot; and Laurie 
              gave an audacious tweak at the tassel. </p>
            <p>&quot;Are you going?&quot; demanded Jo, diving for the pillow. 
            </p>
            <p>He fled at once, and the minute it was well, &quot;Up with the 
              bonnets of bonnie Dundee,&quot; she slipped away to return no more 
              till the young gentleman departed in high dudgeon.</p>
            <p>Jo lay long awake that night, and was just dropping off when the 
              sound of a stifled sob made her fly to Beth's bedside, with the 
              anxious inquiry, &quot;What is it, dear?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I thought you were asleep,&quot; sobbed Beth. </p>
            <p>&quot;Is it the old pain, my precious?' </p>
            <p>&quot;No, it's a new one, but I can bear it.&quot; And Beth tried 
              to check her tears. </p>
            <p>&quot;Tell me all about it, and let me cure it as I often did the 
              other.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You can't, there is no cure.&quot; There Beth's voice gave 
              way, and clinging to her sister, she cried so despairingly that 
              Jo was frightened. </p>
            <p>&quot;Where is it? Shall I call Mother?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, no, don't call her, don't tell her. I shall be better 
              soon. Lie down here and `poor' my head. I'll be quiet and go to 
              sleep, indeed I will.&quot; Jo obeyed, but as her hand went softly 
              to and fro across Beth's hot forehead and wet eyelids, her heart 
              was very full and she longed to speak. But young as she was, Jo 
              had learned that hearts, like flowers, cannot be rudely handled, 
              but must open naturally, so though she believed she knew the cause 
              of Beth's new pain, she only said, in her tenderest tone, &quot;Does 
              anything trouble you, deary?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, Jo,&quot; after a long pause. </p>
            <p>&quot;Wouldn't it comfort you to tell me what it is?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;not now, not yet.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Then I won't ask, but remember, Bethy, that Mother and Jo 
              are always glad to hear and help you, if they can.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I know it. I'll tell you by-and-by.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Is the pain better now?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, yes, much better, you are so comfortable, Jo.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Go to sleep, dear. I'll stay with you.&quot; </p>
            <p>So cheek to cheek they fell asleep, and on the morrow Beth seemed 
              quite herself again, for at eighteen neither heads nor hearts ache 
              long, and a loving word can medicine most ills. </p>
            <p>But Jo had made up her mind, and after pondering over a project 
              for some days, she confided it to her mother. </p>
            <p>&quot;You asked me the other day what my wishes were. I'll tell 
              you one of them, Marmee,&quot; she began, as they sat along together. 
              &quot;I want to go away somewhere this winter for a change.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, Jo?&quot; And her mother looked up quickly, as if the 
              words suggested a double meaning. </p>
            <p>With her eyes on her work Jo answered soberly, &quot;I want something 
              new. I feel restless and anxious to be seeing, doing, and learning 
              more than I am. I brood too much over my own small affairs, and 
              need stirring up, so as I can be spared this winter, I'd like to 
              hop a little way and try my wings.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Where will you hop?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;To New York. I had a bright idea yesterday, and this is it. 
              You know Mrs. Kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person 
              to teach her children and sew. It's rather hard to find just the 
              thing, but I think I should suit if I tried.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;My dear, go out to service in that great boarding house!&quot; 
              And Mrs. March looked surprised, but not displeased. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's not exactly going out to service, for Mrs. Kirke is 
              your friend--the kindest soul that ever lived--and would make things 
              pleasant for me, I know. Her family is separate from the rest, and 
              no one knows me there. Don't care if they do. It's honest work, 
              and I'm not ashamed of it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Nor I. But your writing?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;All the better for the change. I shall see and hear new things, 
              get new ideas, and even if I haven't much time there, I shall bring 
              home quantities of material for my rubbish.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;I have no doubt of it, but are these your only reasons for 
              this sudden fancy?'</p>
            <p>&quot;No, Mother.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;May I know the others?&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo looked up and Jo looked down, then said slowly, with sudden 
              color in her cheeks. &quot;It may be vain and wrong to say it, but--I'm 
              afraid--Laurie is getting too fond of me.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;Then you don't care for him in the way it is evident he 
              begins to care for you?' And Mrs. March looked anxious as she put 
              the question. </p>
            <p>&quot;Mercy, no! I love the dear boy, as I always have, and am 
              immensely proud of him, but as for anything more, it's out of the 
              question.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm glad of that, Jo.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, please?' </p>
            <p>&quot;Because, dear, I don't think you suited to one another. As 
              friends you are very happy, and your frequent quarrels soon blow 
              over, but I fear you would both rebel if you were mated for life. 
              You are too much alike and too fond of freedom, not to mention hot 
              tempers and strong wills, to get on happily together, in a relation 
              which needs infinite patience and forbearance, as well as love.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That's just the feeling I had, though I couldn't express 
              it. I'm glad you think he is only beginning to care for me. It would 
              trouble me sadly to make him unhappy, for I couldn't fall in love 
              with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude, could I?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;You are sure of his feeling for you?&quot; </p>
            <p>The color deepened in Jo's cheeks as she answered, with the look 
              of mingled pleasure, pride, and pain which young girls wear when 
              speaking of first lovers, &quot;I'm afraid it is so, Mother. He 
              hasn't said anything, but he looks a great deal. I think I had better 
              go away before it comes to anything.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;I agree with you, and if it can be managed you shall go.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Jo looked relieved, and after a pause, said, smiling, &quot;How 
              Mrs. Moffat would wonder at your want of management, if she knew, 
              and how she will rejoice that Annie may still hope.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;AH, Jo, mothers may differ in their management, but the 
              hope is the same in all--the desire to see their children happy. 
              Meg is so, and I am content with her success. You I leave to enjoy 
              your liberty till you tire of it, for only then will you find that 
              there is something sweeter. Amy is my chief care now, but her good 
              sense will help ;her. For Beth, I indulge no hopes except that she 
              may be well. By the way, she seems brighter this last day or two. 
              Have you spoken to her?' </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, she owned she had a trouble, and promised to tell me 
              by-and-by. I said no more, for I think I know it,&quot; And Jo told 
              her little story. </p>
            <p>Mrs. March shook her head, and did not take so romantic a view 
              of the case, but looked grave, and repeated her opinion that for 
              Laurie's sake Jo should go away for a time.</p>
            <p>&quot;Let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled, 
              then I'll run away before he can collect his wits and be tragic. 
              Beth must think I'm going to please myself, as I am, for I can't 
              talk about Laurie to her. But she can pet and comfort him after 
              I'm gone, and so cure him of this romantic notion. He's been through 
              so many little trials of the sort, he's used to it, and will soon 
              get over his lovelornity.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo spoke hopefully, but could not rid herself of the foreboding 
              fear that this `little trial' would be harder than the others, and 
              that Laurie would not get over his `lovelornity' as easily as heretofore. 
            </p>
            <p>The plan was talked over in a family council and agreed upon, for 
              Mrs. Kirke gladly accepted Jo, and promised to make a pleasant home 
              for her. The teaching would render her independent, and such leisure 
              as she got might be made profitable by writing, while the new scenes 
              and society would be both useful and agreeable. Jo liked the prospect 
              and was eager to be gone, for the home nest was growing too narrow 
              for her restless nature and adventurous spirit. When all was settled, 
              with fear and trembling she told Laurie, but to her surprise he 
              took it very quietly. He had been graver than usual of late, but 
              very pleasant, and when jokingly accused of turning over a new leaf, 
              he answered soberly, &quot;So I am, and I mean this one shall stay 
              turned.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should 
              come on just then, and made her preparations with a lightened heart, 
              for Beth seemed more cheerful, and hoped she was doing the best 
              for all. </p>
            <p>&quot;One thing I leave in your especial care,&quot; she said, 
              the night before she left. </p>
            <p>&quot;You mean your papers?&quot; asked Beth. &quot;No, my boy. 
              Be very good to him, won't you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Of course I will, but I can't fill your place, and he'll 
              miss you sadly.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;It won't hurt him, so remember, I leave him in your charge, 
              to plague, pet, and keep in order.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll do my best, for your sake,&quot; promised Beth, wondering 
              why Jo looked at her so queerly. </p>
            <p>When Laurie said good-by, he whispered significantly, &quot;It 
              won't do a bit of good, Jo. My eye is on you, so mind what you do, 
              or I'll come and bring you home.&quot;</p>

              <br>
              Beth was postmistress, for, being most at home, she could attend 
              to it regularly, and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the 
              little door and distributing the mail. One July day she came in 
              with her hands full, and went about the house leaving letters and 
              parcels like the penny post. </p>
            <p>&quot;Here's your posy, Mother! Laurie never forgets that,&quot; 
              she said, putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in `Marmee's 
              corner', and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy. </p>
            <p>&quot;Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove,&quot; continued Beth, 
              delivering the articles to her sister, who sat near her mother, 
              stitching wristbands. </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one,&quot; 
              said Meg, looking at the gray cotton glove. &quot;Didn't you drop 
              the other in the garden?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I'm sure I didn't, for there was only one in the office.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I hate to have odd gloves! Never mind, the other may be 
              found. My letter is only a translation of the German song I wanted. 
              I think Mr. Brooke did it, for this isn't Laurie's writing.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in her gingham 
              morning gown, with the little curls blowing about her forehead, 
              and very womanly, as she sat sewing at her little worktable, full 
              of tidy white rolls, so unconscious of the thought in her mother's 
              mind as she sewed and sang, while her fingers flew and her thoughts 
              were busied with girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies 
              in her belt, that Mrs. March smiled and was satisfied. </p>
            <p>&quot;Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which 
              covered the whole post office and stuck outside,&quot; said Beth, 
              laughing as she went into the study where Jo sat writing. </p>
            <p> &quot;What a sly fellow Laurie is! I said I wished bigger hats 
              were the fashion, because I burn my face every hot day. He said, 
              `Why mind the fashion? Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!' I said 
              I would if I had one, and he has sent me this to try me. I'll wear 
              it for fun, and show him I don't care for the fashion.&quot; And 
              hanging the antique broadbrim on a bust of Plato, Jo read her letters. 
            </p>
            <p>One from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill, for 
              it said to her... <br>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
<p>My Dear: </p>
              <p>I write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction 
                I watch your efforts to control your temper. You say nothing about 
                your trials, failures, or successes, and think, perhaps, that 
                no one sees them but the Friend whose help you daily ask, if I 
                may trust the well-worn cover of your guidebook. I, too, have 
                seen them all, and heartily believe in the sincerity of your resolution, 
                since it begins to bear fruit. Go on, dear, patiently and bravely, 
                and always believe that no one sympathizes more tenderly with 
                you than your loving... </p>
              <p>Mother </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><br>
              &quot;That does me good! That's worth millions of money and pecks 
              of praise. Oh, Marmee, I do try! I will keep on trying, and not 
              get tired, since I have you to help me.&quot; </p>
            <p>Laying her head on her arms, Jo wet her little romance with a few 
              happy tears. for she had thought that no one saw and appreciated 
              her efforts to be good, and this assurance was doubly precious, 
              doubly encouraging, because unexpected and from the person whose 
              commendation she most valued. Feeling stronger than ever to meet 
              and subdue her Apollyon, she pinned the note inside her frock, as 
              a shield and a reminder, lest she be taken unaware, and proceeded 
              to open her other letter, quite ready for either good or bad news. 
              In a big, dashing hand, Laurie wrote... <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Dear Jo, </p>
              <p>What ho! </p>
              <p>Some english girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow and 
                I want to have a jolly time. If it's fine, I'm going to pitch 
                my tent in Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and 
                croquet--have a fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all sorts 
                of larks. They are nice people, and like such things. Brooke will 
                go to keep us boys steady, and Kate Vaughn will play propriety 
                for the girls. I want you all to come, can't let Beth off at any 
                price, and nobody shall worry her. on't bother about rations, 
                I'll see to that and everything else, only do come, there's a 
                good fellow! </p>
              <p>In a tearing hurry, </p>
              <p>Yours ever, Laurie. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><br>
              &quot;Here's richness!&quot; cried Jo, flying in to tell the news 
              to Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;Of course we can go, Mother? It will be such a help to Laurie, 
              for I can row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children be useful 
              in some way.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I hope the Vaughns are not fine grown-up people. Do you know 
              anything about them, Jo?&quot; asked Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;Only that there are four of them. Kate is older than you, 
              Fred and Frank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), 
              who is nine or ten. Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys. 
              I fancied, from the way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her, 
              that he didn't admire Kate much.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;I'm so glad my French print is clean, it's just the thing 
              and so becoming!&quot; observed Meg complacently. &quot;Have you 
              anything decent, Jo?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me. I shall 
              row and tramp about, so I don't want any starch to think of. You'll 
              come, Betty?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;If you won't let any boys talk to me.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Not a boy!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I like to please Laurie, and I'm not afraid of Mr. Brooke, 
              he is so kind. But I don't want to play, or sing, or say anything. 
              I'll work hard and not trouble anyone, and you'll take care of me, 
              Jo, so I'll go.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That's my good girl. You do try to fight off your shyness, 
              and I love you for it. Fighting faults isn't easy, as I know, and 
              a cheery word kind of gives a lift. Thank you, Mother,&quot; And 
              Jo gave the thin cheek a grateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March 
              than if it had given back the rosy roundness of her youth. </p>
            <p>&quot;I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted 
              to copy,&quot; said Amy, showing her mail. </p>
            <p>&quot;And I got a note from Mr. Laurence, asking me to come over 
              and play to him tonight, before the lamps are lighted, and I shall 
              go,&quot; added Beth, whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered 
              finely. &quot;Now let's fly round, and do double duty today, so 
              that we can play tomorrow with free minds,&quot; said Jo, preparing 
              to replace her pen with a broom. </p>
            <p>When the sun peeped into the girls' room early next morning to 
              promise them a fine day, he saw a comical sight. Each had made such 
              preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had 
              an extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead, Jo had copiously 
              anointed her afflicted face with cold cream, Beth had taken Joanna 
              to bed with her to atone for the approaching separation, and Amy 
              had capped the climax by putting a colthespin on her nose to uplift 
              the offending feature. It was one of the kind artists use to hold 
              the paper on their drawing boards, therefore quite appropriate and 
              effective for the purpose it was now being put. This funny spectacle 
              appeared to amuse the sun, for he burst out with such radiance that 
              Jo woke up and roused her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy's ornament. 
            </p>
            <p>Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and 
              soon a lively bustle began in both houses. Beth, who was ready first, 
              kept reporting what went on next door, and enlivened her sisters' 
              toilets by frequent telegrams from the window. &quot;There goes 
              the man with the tent! I see Mrs. Barker doing up the lunch in a 
              hamper and a great basket. Now Mr. Laurence is looking up at the 
              sky and the weathercock. I wish he would go too. There's Laurie, 
              looking like a sailor, nice boy! Oh, mercy me! Here's a carriage 
              full of people, a tall lady, a little girl, and two dreadful boys. 
              One is lame, poor thing, he's got a crutch. Laurie didn't tell us 
              that. Be quick, girls! It's getting late. Why, there is Ned Moffat, 
              I do declare. Meg, isn't that the man who bowed to you one day when 
              we were shopping?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;So it is. How queer that he should come. I thought he was 
              at the mountains. There is Sallie. I'm glad she got back in time. 
              Am I all right, Jo?&quot; cried Meg in a flutter. </p>
            <p>&quot;A regular daisy. Hold up your dress and put your hat on straight, 
              it looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the first 
              puff. Now then, come on!&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat? It's too 
              absurd! You shall not make a guy of yourself,&quot; remonstrated 
              Meg, as Jo tied down with a red ribbon the broad-brimmed, old-fashioned 
              leghorn Laurie had sent for a joke. </p>
            <p>&quot;I just will, though, for it's capital, so shady, light, and 
              big. It will make fun, and I don't mind being a guy if I'm comfortable.With 
              that Jo marched straight away and the rest followed, a bright little 
              band of sisters, all looking their best in summer suits, with happy 
              faces under the jaunty hatbrims. </p>
            <p>Laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most 
              cordial manner. The lawn was the reception room, and for several 
              minutes a lively scene was enacted there. Meg was grateful to see 
              that Miss Kate, though twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which 
              American girls would do well to imitate, and who was much flattered 
              by Mr. Ned's assurances that he came especially to see her. Jo understood 
              why Laurie `primmed up his mouth' when speaking of Kate, for that 
              young lady had a standoff-don't-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly 
              with the free and easy demeanor of the other girls. Beth took an 
              observation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not 
              `dreadful', but gentle and feeble, and she would be kind to him 
              on that account. Amy found Grace a well-mannered, merry, little 
              person, and after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes, 
              they suddenly became very good friends. </p>
            <p>Tents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand, 
              the party was soon embarked, and the two boats pushed off together, 
              leaving Mr. Laurence waving his hat on the shore. Laurie and Jo 
              rowed one boat, Mr. Brooke and Ned the other, while Fred Vaughn, 
              the riotous twin, did his best to upset both by paddling about in 
              a wherry like a disturbed water bug. Jo's funny hat deserved a vote 
              of thanks, for it was of general utility. It broke the ice in the 
              beginning by producing a laugh, it created quite a refreshing breeze, 
              flapping to and fro as she rowed, and would make an excellent umbrella 
              for the whole party, if a shower came up, she said. Miss Kate decided 
              that she was `odd', but rather clever, and smiled upon her from 
              afar. </p>
            <p>Meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face 
              with the rowers, who both admired the prospect and feathered their 
              oars with uncommon `skill and dexterity'. Mr. Brooke was a grave, 
              silent young man, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice. 
              Meg liked his quiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia 
              of useful knowledge. He never talked to her much, but he looked 
              at her a good deal, and she felt sure that he did not regard her 
              with aversion. Ned, being in college, of course put on all the airs 
              which freshmen think it their bounden duty to assume. He was not 
              very wise, but very good-natured, and altogether an excellent person 
              to carry on a picnic. Sallie Gardiner was absorbed in keeping her 
              white pique dress clean and chattering with the ubiquitous Fred, 
              who kept Beth in constant terror by his pranks. </p>
            <p>It was not far to Longmeadow, but the tent was pitched and the 
              wickets down by the time they arrived. A pleasant green field, with 
              three wide-spreading oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of turf 
              for croquet. </p>
            <p>&quot;Welcome to Camp Laurence!&quot; said the young host, as they 
              landed with exclamations of delight. </p>
            <p>&quot;Brooke is commander in chief, I am commissary general, the 
              other fellows are staff officers, and you, ladies, are company. 
              The tent is for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing 
              room, this is the messroom and the third is the camp kitchen. Now, 
              let's have a game before it gets hot, and then we'll see about dinner.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Frank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game played by 
              the other eight. Mr. Brooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fred. Laurie took 
              Sallie, Jo, and Ned. The English played well, but the Americans 
              played better, and contested every inch of the ground as strongly 
              as if the spirit of `76 inspired them. Jo and Fred had several skirmishes 
              and once narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket 
              and had missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal. 
              Fred was close behind her and his turn came before hers. He gave 
              a stroke, his ball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong 
              side. No one was very near, and running up to examine, he gave it 
              a sly nudge with his toe, which put it just an inch on the right 
              side. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm through! Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you, and get in first,&quot; 
              cried the young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another blow. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You pushed it. I saw you. It's my turn now,&quot; said Jo 
              sharply. </p>
            <p>&quot;Upon my word, I didn't move it. It rolled a bit, perhaps, 
              but that is allowed. So, stand off please, and let me have a go 
              at the stake.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;We don't cheat in America, but you can, if you choose,&quot; 
              said Jo angrily. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows. There 
              you go!&quot; returned Fred, croqueting her ball far away. </p>
            <p>Jo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself in 
              time, colored up to her forehead and stood a minute, hammering down 
              a wicket with all her might, while Fred hit the stake and declared 
              himself out with much exultation. She went off to get her ball, 
              and was a long time finding it among the bushes, but she cameback, 
              looking cool and quiet, and waited her turn patiently. It took several 
              strokes to regain the place she had lost, and when she got there, 
              the other side had nearly won, for Kate's ball was the last but 
              one and lay near the stake. </p>
            <p>&quot;By George, it's all up with us! Goodbye, Kate. Miss Jo owes 
              me one, so you are finished,&quot; cried Fred excitedly, as they 
              all drew near to see the finish. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies,&quot; 
              said Jo, with a look that made the lad redden, &quot;especially 
              when they beat them,&quot; she added, as, leaving Kate's ball untouched, 
              she won the game by a clever stroke. </p>
            <p>Laurie threw up his hat, then remembered that it wouldn't do to 
              exult over the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of 
              the cheer to whisper to his friend, &quot;Good for you, Jo! He did 
              cheat, I saw him. We can't tell him so, but he won't do it again, 
              take my word for it.&quot; </p>
            <p>Meg drew her aside, under pretense of pinning up a loose braid, 
              and said approvingly, &quot;It was dreadfully provoking, but you 
              kept your temper, and I'm so glad, Jo.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't praise me, Meg, for I could box his ears this minute. 
              I should certainly have boiled over if I hadn't stayed among the 
              nettles till I got my rage under control enough to hold my tongue.. 
              It's simmering now, so I hope he'll keep out of my way,&quot; returned 
              Jo, biting her lips as she glowered at Fred from under her big hat. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Time for lunch,&quot; said Mr. Brooke, looking at his watch. 
              &quot;Commissary general, will you make the fire and get water, 
              while Miss March, Miss Sallie, and I spread the table? Who can make 
              good coffee?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Jo can,&quot; said Meg, glad to recommend her sister. So 
              Jo, feeling that her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, 
              went to preside over the coffeepot, while the children collected 
              dry sticks, and the boys made a fire and got water from a spring 
              near by. Miss Kate sketched and Frank talked to Beth, who was making 
              little mats of braided rushes to serve as plates. </p>
            <p>The commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth 
              with an inviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated 
              with green leaves. Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and everyone 
              settled themselves to a hearty meal, for youth is seldom dyspeptic, 
              and exercise develops wholesome appetites. A very merry lunch it 
              was, for everything seemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of 
              laughter startled a venerable horse who fed near by. There was a 
              pleasing inequality in the table, which produced many mishaps to 
              cups and plates, acorns dropped in the milk, little black ants partook 
              of the refreshments without being invited, and fuzzy caterpillars 
              swung down from the tree to see what was going on. Three white-headed 
              children peeped over the fence, and an objectionable dog barked 
              at them from the other side of the river with all his might and 
              main. </p>
            <p>&quot;There's salt here,&quot; said Laurie, as he handed Jo a saucer 
              of berries. </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you, I prefer spiders,&quot; she replied, fishing up 
              two unwary little ones who had gone to a creamy death. &quot;How 
              dare you remind me of that horrid dinner party, when your's is so 
              nice in every way?' added Jo, as they both laughed and ate out of 
              one plate, the china having run short. </p>
            <p>&quot;I had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven't got over 
              it yet. This is no credit to me, you know, I don't do anything. 
              It's you and Meg and Brooke who make it all go, and I'm no end obliged 
              to you. what shall we do when we can't eat anymore?&quot; asked 
              Laurie, feeling that his trump card had been played when lunch was 
              over. </p>
            <p>&quot;Have games till it's cooler. I brought Authors, and I dare 
              say Miss Kate knows something new and nice. Go and ask her. She's 
              company, and you ought to stay with her more.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Aren't you company too? I thought she'd suit Brooke, but 
              he keeps talking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that 
              ridiculous glass of hers'. I'm going, so you needn't try to preach 
              propriety, for you can't do it, Jo.&quot; </p>
            <p>Miss Kate did know several new games, and as the girls would not, 
              and the boys could not, eat any more, they all adjourned to the 
              drawing room to play Rig-marole. </p>
            <p>&quot;One person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells 
              as long as he pleases, only taking care to stop short at some exciting 
              point, when the next takes it up and does the same. It's very funny 
              when well done, and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff 
              to laugh over. Please start it, Mr. Brooke,&quot; said Kate, with 
              a commanding air, which surprised Meg, who treated the tutor with 
              as much respect as any other gentleman. </p>
            <p>Lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr. Brooke 
              obediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes steadily 
              fixed upon the sunshiny river. </p>
            <p>&quot;Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek 
              his fortune, for he had nothing but his sword and his shield. He 
              traveled a long while, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a 
              hard time of it, till he came to the palace of a good old king, 
              who had offered a reward to anyone who could tame and train a fine 
              but unbroken colt, of which he was very fond. The knight agreed 
              to try, and got on slowly but surely, for the colt was a gallant 
              fellow, and soon learned to love his new master, though he was freakish 
              and wild. Every day, when he gave his lessons to this pet of the 
              king's, the knight rode him through the city, and as he rode, he 
              looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face, which he had seen 
              many times in his dreams, but never found. One day, as he went prancing 
              down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a ruinous castle the 
              lovely face. He was delighted, inquired who lived in this old castle, 
              and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by 
              a spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty. 
              The knight wished intensely that he could free them, but he was 
              poor and could only go by each day, watching for the sweet face 
              and longing to see it out in the sunshine. At last he resolved to 
              get into the castle and ask how he could help them. He went and 
              knocked. The great door flew open, and he beheld . ..&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;A ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of rapture, 
              `At last! At last!'&quot; continued Kate, who had read French novels, 
              and admired the style. &quot;`Tis she!' cried Count Gustave, and 
              fell at her feet in an ecstasy of joy. `Oh, rise!' she said, extending 
              a hand of marble fairness. `Never! Till you tell me how I may rescue 
              you, ' swore the knight, still kneeling. `Alas, my cruel fate condemns 
              me to remain here till my tyrant is destroyed.' `Where is the villain?' 
              `In the mauve salon. Go, brave heart, and save me from despair.' 
              `I obey, and return victorious or dead!' With these thrilling words 
              he rushed away, and flinging open the door of the mauve salon, was 
              about to enter, when he received...&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old 
              fellow in a black gown fired at him,&quot; said Ned. &quot;Instantly, 
              Sir What's-his-name recovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of 
              the window, and turned to join the lady, victorious, but with a 
              bump on his brow, found the door locked, tore up the curtains, made 
              a rope ladder, got halfway down when the ladder broke, and he went 
              headfirst into the moat, sixty feet below. Could swim like a duck, 
              paddled round the castle till he came to a little door guarded by 
              two stout fellows, knocked their heads together till they cracked 
              like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling exertion of his prodigious 
              strength, he smashed in the door, went up a pair of stone steps 
              covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as your fist, and spiders 
              that would frighten you into hysterics, MIss March. At the top of 
              these steps he came plump upon a sight that took his breath away 
              and chilled his blood...&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and 
              a lamp in its wasted hand,&quot; went on Meg. &quot;It beckoned, 
              gliding noiselessly before him down a corridor as dark and cold 
              as any tomb. Shadowy effigies in armor stood on either side, a dead 
              silence reigned, the lamp burned blue, and the ghostly figure ever 
              and anon turned its face toward him, showing the glitter of awful 
              eyes through its white veil. They reached a curtained door, behind 
              which sounded lovely music. He sprang forward to enter, but the 
              specter plucked him back, and waved threateningly before him a...&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Snuffbox,&quot; said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed 
              the audience. &quot;`Thankee, ' said the knight politely, as he 
              took a pinch and sneezed seven times so violently that his head 
              fell off. `Ha! Ha!' laughed the ghost, and having peeped through 
              the keyhole at the princesses spinning away for dear life, the evil 
              spirit picked up her victim and put him in a large tin box, where 
              there were eleven other knights packed together without their heads, 
              like sardines, who all rose and began to...&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Dance a hornpipe,&quot; cut in Fred, as Jo paused for breath, 
              &quot;and, as they danced, the rubbishy old castle turned to a man-of-war 
              in full sail. `Up with the jib, reef the tops'l halliards, helm 
              hard alee, and man the guns!' roared the captain, as a Portuguese 
              pirate hove in sight, with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast. 
              `Go in and win, my hearties!' says the captain, and a tremendous 
              fight began. Of course the British beat, they always do.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;No, they don't!&quot; cried Jo, aside. </p>
            <p>&quot;Having taken the pirate captain prisoner, sailed slap over 
              the schooner, whose decks were piled high with dead and whose lee 
              scuppers ran blood, for the order had been `Cutlasses, and die hard!' 
              `Bosun's mate, take a bight of the flying-jib sheet, and start this 
              villain if he doesn't confess his sins double quick, ' said the 
              British captain. The Portuguese held his tongue like a brick, and 
              walked the plank, while the jolly tars cheered like mad. But the 
              sly dog dived, came up under the man-of-war, scuttled her, and down 
              she went, with all sail set, `To the bottom of the sea, sea, sea' 
              where...&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, gracious! What shall I say?&quot; cried Sallie, as Fred 
              ended his rigmarole, in which he had jumbled together pell-mell 
              nautical phrases and facts out of one of his favorite books. &quot;Well, 
              they went to the bottom, and a nice mermaid welcomed them, but was 
              much grieved on finding the box of headless knights, and kindly 
              pickled them in brine, hoping to discover the mystery about them, 
              for being a woman, she was curious. By-and-by a diver came down, 
              and the mermaid said, `I'll give you a box of pearls if you can 
              take it up, ' for she wanted to restore the poor things to life, 
              and couldn't raise the heavy load herself. So the diver hoisted 
              it up, and was much disappointed on opening it to find no pearls. 
              He left it in a great lonely field, where it was found by a...&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Little goose girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field,&quot; 
              said Amy, when Sallie's invention gave out. &quot;The little girl 
              was sorry for them, and asked an old woman what she should do to 
              help them. `Your geese will tell you, they know everything.' said 
              the old woman. So she asked what she should use for new heads, since 
              the old ones were lost, and all the geese opened their hundred mouths 
              and screamed...&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;`Cabbages!'&quot; continued Laurie promptly. &quot;`Just 
              the thing, ' said the girl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from 
              her garden. She put them on, the knights revived at once, thanked 
              her, and went on their way rejoicing, never knowing the difference, 
              for there were so many other heads like them in the world that no 
              one thought anything of it. The knight in whom I'm interest went 
              back to find the pretty face, and learned that the princesses had 
              spunthemselves free and all gone and married, but one. He was in 
              a great state of mind at that, and mounting the colt, who stood 
              by him through thick and thin, rushed to the castle to see which 
              was left. Peeping over the hedge, he saw the queen of his affections 
              picking flowers in her garden. `Will you give me a rose?' said he. 
              `You must come and get it. I can't come to you, it isn't proper, 
              ' said she, as sweet as honey. He tried to climb over the hedge, 
              but it seemed to grow higher and higher. Then he tried to push through, 
              but it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair. So he patiently 
              broke twig after twig till he had made a little hole through which 
              he peeped, saying imploringly, `Let me in! Let me in!' But the pretty 
              princess did not seem to understand, for she picked her roses quietly, 
              and left him to fight his way in. Whether he did or not, Frank will 
              tell you.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;I can't. I'm not playing, I never do,&quot; said Frank, 
              dismayed at the sentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue 
              the absurd couple. Beth had disappeared behind Jo, and Grace was 
              asleep.</p>
            <p>&quot;So the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge, is 
              he?&quot; asked Mr. Brooke, still watching the river, and playing 
              with the wild rose in his buttonhole. </p>
            <p>&quot;I guess the princess gave him a posy, and opened the gate 
              after a while,&quot; said Laurie, smiling to himself, as he threw 
              acorns at his tutor. </p>
            <p>&quot;What a piece of nonsense we have made! With practice we might 
              do something quite clever. Do you know Truth?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I hope so,&quot; said Meg soberly. </p>
            <p>&quot;The game, I mean?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;what is it?&quot; said Fred. </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, you pile up your hands, choose a number, and draw out 
              in turn, and the person who draws at the number has to answer truly 
              any question put by the rest. It's great fun.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Let's try it,&quot; said Jo, who liked new experiments. </p>
            <p>Miss Kate and Mr. Booke, Meg, and Ned declined, but Fred, Sallie, 
              Jo, and Laurie piled and drew, and the lot fell to Laurie. </p>
            <p> &quot;Who are your heroes?&quot; asked Jo. </p>
            <p>&quot;Grandfather and Napoleon.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Which lady here do you think prettiest?&quot; said Sallie.</p>
            <p> &quot;Margaret.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Which do you like best?&quot; from Fred. </p>
            <p>&quot;Jo, of course.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;What silly questions you ask!&quot; And Jo gave a disdainful 
              shrug as the rest laughed at Laurie's matter-of-fact tone.</p>
            <p>&quot;Try again. Truth isn't a bad game,&quot; said Fred. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's a very good one for you,&quot; retorted Jo in a low 
              voice. Her turn came next. </p>
            <p>&quot;What is your greatest fault?' asked Fred, by way of testing 
              in her the virtue he lacked himself. </p>
            <p>&quot;A quick temper.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;What do you most wish for?&quot; said Laurie. </p>
            <p>&quot;A pair of boot lacings,&quot; returned Jo, guessing and defeating 
              his purpose. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not a true answer. You must say what you really do want most.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Genius. Don't you wish you could give it to me, Laurie?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>And she slyly smiled in his disappointed face. </p>
            <p>&quot;What virtues do you most admire in a man?&quot; asked Sallie. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Courage and honesty.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Now my turn,&quot; said Fred, as his hand came last.</p>
            <p>&quot;Let's give it to him,&quot; whispered Laurie to Jo, who nodded 
              and asked at once... </p>
            <p>&quot;Didn't you cheat at croquet?' </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, yes, a little bit.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Good! Didn't you take your story out of THE SEA LION?&quot; 
              said Laurie. </p>
            <p>&quot;Rather.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't you think the English nation perfect in every respect?&quot; 
              asked Sallie.</p>
            <p>&quot;I should be ashamed of myself if I didn't.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;He's a true John Bull. Now, Miss Sallie, you shall have a 
              chance without waiting to draw. I'll harrrow up your feelings first 
              by asking if you don't think you are something of a flirt,&quot; 
              said Laurie, as Jo nodded to Fred as a sign that peace was declared. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;You impertinent boy! Of course I'm not,&quot; exclaimed 
              Sallie, with an air that proved the contrary.</p>
            <p>&quot;What do you hate most?&quot; asked Fred.</p>
            <p>&quot;Spiders and rice pudding.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;What do you like best?&quot; asked Jo.</p>
            <p>&quot;Dancing and French gloves.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I think Truth is a very silly play. Let's have a sensible 
              game of Authors to refresh our minds,&quot; proposed Jo. </p>
            <p>Ned, frank, and the little girls joined in this, and while it went 
              on, the three elders sat apart, talking. Miss Kate took out her 
              sketch again, and Margaret watched her, while Mr. Brooke lay on 
              the grass with a book, which he did not read. </p>
            <p>&quot;How beautifully you do it! I wish I could draw,&quot; said 
              Meg, with mingled admiration and regret in her voice. </p>
            <p>&quot;Why don't you learn? I should think you had taste and talent 
              for it,&quot; replied Miss Kate graciously. </p>
            <p>&quot;I haven't time.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Your mamma prefers other accomplishments, I fancy. So did 
              mine, but I proved to her that I had talent by taking a few lessons 
              privately, and then she was quite willing I should go on. Can't 
              you do the same with your governess?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I have none.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I forgot young ladies in America go to school more than with 
              us. Very fine schools they are, too, Papa says. You go to a private 
              one, I suppose?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't go at all. I am a governess myself.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh. indeed!&quot; said Miss Kate, but she might as well have 
              said, &quot;Dear me, how dreadful!&quot; for her tone implied it, 
              and something in her face made Meg color, and wish she had not been 
              so frank. </p>
            <p>Mr. Brooke looked up and said quickly, Young ladies in America 
              love independence as much as their ancestors did, and are admired 
              and respected for supporting themselves.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, yes, of course it's very nice and proper in them to do 
              so. We have many most respectable and worthy young women who do 
              the same and are employed by the nobility, because, being the daughters 
              of gentlemen, they are both well bred and accomplished, you know,&quot; 
              said Miss Kate in a patronizing tone that hurt Meg's pride, and 
              made her work seem not only more distasteful, but degrading. </p>
            <p>&quot;Did the German song suit, Miss March?&quot; inquired Mr. 
              Brooke, breaking an awkward pause. </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, yes! It was very sweet, and I'm much obliged to whoever 
              translated it for me.&quot; And Meg's downcast face brightened as 
              she spoke. </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't you read German?&quot; asked Miss Kate with a look 
              of surprise. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not very well. My father, who taught me, is away, and I don't 
              get on very fast alone, for I've no one to correct my pronunciation.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Try a little now. Here is Schiller's Mary Stuart and a tutor 
              who loves to teach.&quot; And Mr. Brooke laid his book on her lap 
              with an inviting smile. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's so hard I'm afraid to try,&quot; said Meg, grateful, 
              but bashful in the presence of the accomplished young lady beside 
              her. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll read a bit to encourage you.&quot; And Miss Kate read 
              one of the most beautiful passages in a perfectly correct but perfectly 
              expressionless manner. </p>
            <p>Mr. Brooke made no comment as she returned the book to Meg, who 
              said innocently, &quot;I thought it was poetry.&quot; &quot;Some 
              of it is. Try this passage.&quot; </p>
            <p>There was a queer smile about Mr. Brooke's mouth as he opened at 
              poor Mary's lament. </p>
            <p>Meg obediently following the long grass-blade which her new tutor 
              used to point with, read slowly and timidly, unconsciously making 
              poetry of the hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice. 
              Down the page went the green guide, and presently, forgetting her 
              listener in the beauty of the sad scene, Meg read as if alone, giving 
              a little touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen. If 
              she had seen the brown eyes then, she would have stopped short, 
              but she never looked up, and the lesson was not spoiled for her. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very well indeed!&quot; said Mr. Brooke, as she paused, quite 
              ignoring her many mistakes, and looking as if he did indeed love 
              to teach. </p>
            <p>Miss Kate put up her glass, and, having taken a survey of the little 
              tableau before her, shut her sketch book, saying with condescension, 
              &quot;You've a nice accent and in time will be a clever reader. 
              I advise you to learn, for German is a valuable accomplishment to 
              teachers. I must look after Grace, she is romping.&quot; And Miss 
              Kate strolled away, adding to herself with a shrug, &quot;I didn't 
              come to chaperone a governess, though she is young and pretty. What 
              odd people these Yankees are. I'm afraid Laurie will be quite spoiled 
              among them.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I forgot that English people rather turn up their noses at 
              governesses and don't treat them as we do,&quot; said Meg, looking 
              after the retreating figure with an annoyed expression. </p>
            <p>&quot;Tutors also have rather a hard time of it there, as I know 
              to my sorrow. There's no place like America for us workers, Miss 
              Margaret.&quot; And Mr. Brooke looked so contented and cheerful 
              that Meg was ashamed to lament her hard lot. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm glad I live in it then. I don't like my work, but I get 
              a good deal of satisfaction out of it after all, so I won't complain. 
              I only wished I liked teaching as you do.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I think you would if you had Laurie for a pupil. I shall 
              be very sorry to lose him next year,&quot; said Mr. Brooke, busily 
              punching holes in the turf.</p>
            <p>&quot;Going to college, I suppose?&quot; Meg's lips asked the question, 
              but her eyes added, &quot;And what becomes of you?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, it's high time he went, for he is ready, and as soon 
              as he is off, I shall turn soldier. I am needed.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I am glad of that!&quot; exclaimed Meg. &quot;I should think 
              every young man would want to go, though it is hard for the mothers 
              and sisters who stay at home,&quot; she added sorrowfully. </p>
            <p>&quot;I have neither, and very few friends to care whether I live 
              or die,&quot; said Mr. Brooke rather bitterly as he absently put 
              the dead rose in the hole he had made and covered it up, like a 
              little grave. </p>
            <p>&quot;Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal, and we 
              should all be very sorry to have any harm happen to you,&quot; said 
              Meg heartily.</p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you, that sounds pleasant,&quot; began Mr. Brooke, 
              looking cheerful again, but before he could finish his speech, Ned, 
              mounted on the old horse, came lumbering up to display his equestrian 
              skill before the young ladies, and there was no more quiet that 
              day. </p>
            <p> &quot;Don't you love to ride?&quot; asked Grace of Amy, as they 
              stood resting after a race round the field with the others, led 
              by Ned. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I dote upon it. My sister, Meg, used to ride when Papa was 
              rich, but we don't keep any horses now, except Ellen Tree,&quot; 
              added Amy, laughing. </p>
            <p>&quot;Tell me about Ellen Tree. Is it a donkey?&quot; asked Grace 
              curiously.</p>
            <p>&quot;Why, you see, Jo is crazy about horses and so am I, but we've 
              only got an old sidesaddle and no horse. Out in our garden is an 
              apple tree that has a nice low branch, so Jo put the saddle on it, 
              fixed some reins on the part that turns up, and we bounce away on 
              Ellen Tree whenever we like.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;How funny!&quot; laughed Grace. &quot;I have a pony at home, 
              and ride nearly every day in the park with Fred and Kate. It's very 
              nice, for my friends go too, and the Row is full of ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Dear, how charming! I hope I shall go abroad some day, but 
              I'd rather go to Rome than the row,&quot; said Amy, who had not 
              the remotest idea what the Row was and wouldn't have asked for the 
              world. </p>
            <p>Frank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they were 
              saying, and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture 
              as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical 
              gymnastics. Beth, who was collecting the scattered Author cards, 
              looked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way, &quot;I'm afraid 
              you are tired. Can I do anything for you?&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;Talk to me, please. It's dull, sitting by myself,&quot; 
              answered Frank, who had evidently been used to being made much of 
              at home. </p>
            <p>If he asked her to deliver a Latin oration, it would not have seemed 
              a more impossible task to bashful Beth, but there was no place to 
              run to, no Jo to hide behind now, and the poor boy looked so wistfully 
              at her that she bravely resolved to try. </p>
            <p> &quot;What do you like to talk about?&quot; she asked, fumbling 
              over the cards and dropping half as she tried to tie them up. </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting,&quot; 
              said Frank, who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his 
              strength. </p>
            <p>My heart! What shall I do? I don't know anything about them, thought 
              Beth, and forgetting the boy's misfortune in her flurry, she said, 
              hoping to make him talk, &quot;I never saw any hunting, but I suppose 
              you know all about it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I did once, but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping 
              a confounded five-barred gate, so there are no more horses and hounds 
              for me,&quot; said Frank with a sigh that made Beth hate herself 
              for her innocent blunder. </p>
            <p>&quot;Your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes,&quot; 
              she said, turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that 
              she had read one of the boys' books in which Jo delighted. </p>
            <p>Buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory, and in her eagerness 
              to amuse another, Beth forgot herself, and was quite unconscious 
              of her sisters' surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of 
              Beth talking away to one of the dreadful boys, against whom she 
              had begged protection.</p>
            <p>&quot;Bless her heart! She pities him, so she is good to him,&quot; 
              aid Jo, beaming at her from the croquet ground.</p>
            <p>&quot;I always said she was a little saint,&quot; added Meg, as 
              if there could be no further doubt of it.</p>
            <p>&quot;I haven't heard Frank laugh so much for ever so long,&quot; 
              said Grace to Amy, as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets 
              out of the acorn cups. </p>
            <p>&quot;My sister Beth is a very fastidious girl, when she likes 
              to be,&quot; said Amy, well pleased at Beth's success. She meant 
              `facinating', but as Grace didn't know the exact meaning of either 
              word, fastidious sounded well and made a good impression. </p>
            <p>An impromptu circus, fox and geese, and an amicable game of croquet 
              finished the afternoon. At sunset the tent was struck, hampers packed, 
              wickets pulled up, boats loaded, and the whole party floated down 
              the river, singing at the tops of their voices. Ned, getting sentimental, 
              warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain... </p>
            <p>Alone, alone, ah! Woe, alone, <br>
              and at the lines... </p>
            <p>We each are young, we each have a heart, Oh, why should we stand 
              thus coldly apart? </p>
            <p>he looked at Meg with such a lackadiasical expression that she 
              laughed outright and spoiled his song. </p>
            <p>&quot;How can you be so cruel to me?&quot; he whispered, under 
              cover of a lively chorus. &quot;You've kept close to that starched-up 
              Englishwoman all day, and now you snub me.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I didn't mean to, but you looked so funny I really couldn't 
              help it,&quot; replied Meg, passing over the first part of his reproach, 
              for it was quite true that she had shunned him, remembering the 
              Moffat party and the talk after it. </p>
            <p>Ned was offended and turned to Sallie for consolation, saying to 
              her rather pettishly, &quot;There isn't a bit of flirt in that girl, 
              is there?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Not a particle, but she's a dear,&quot; returned Sallie, 
              defending her friend even while confessing her shortcomings. </p>
            <p>&quot;She's not a stricken deer anyway,&quot; said Ned, trying 
              to be witty, and succeeding as well as very young gentlemen usually 
              do. </p>
            <p>On the lawn where it had gathered, the little party separated with 
              cordial good nights and good-bys, for the Vaughns were going to 
              Canada. As the four sisters went home through the garden, Miss Kate 
              looked after them, saying, without the patronizing tone in her voice, 
              &quot;In spite of their demonstrative manners, American girls are 
              very nice when one knows them.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I quite agree with you,&quot; said Mr. Brooke. </p>

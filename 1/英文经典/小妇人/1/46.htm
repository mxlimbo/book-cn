            <p> <br>
              While Laurie and Amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet carpets, 
              as they set their house in order, and planned a blissful future, 
              Mr. Bhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort, along 
              muddy roads and sodden fields. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I always do take a walk toward evening, and I don't know why 
              I should give it up, just because I happen to meet the Professor 
              on his way out,&quot; said Jo to herself, after two or three encounters, 
              for though there were two paths to Meg's whichever one she took 
              she was sure to meet him., either going or returning. </p>
            <p>He was always walking rapidly, and never seemed to see her until 
              quite close, when he would look as if his short-sighted eyes had 
              failed to recognize the approaching lady till that moment. Then, 
              if she was going to Meg's he always had something for the babies. 
              If her face was turned homeward, he had merely strolled down to 
              see the river, and was just returning, unless they were tired of 
              his frequent calls. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Under the circumstances, what could Jo do but greet him civilly, 
              and invite him in? If she was tired of his visits, she concealed 
              her weariness with perfect skill, and took care that there should 
              be coffee for supper, &quot;as Friedrich--I mean Mr. Bhaer--doesn't 
              like tea.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>By the second week, everyone knew perfectly well what was going 
              on, yet everyone tried to look as if they were stone-blind to the 
              changes in Jo's face. They never asked why she sang about her work, 
              did up her hair three times a day, and got so blooming with her 
              evening exercise. And no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion 
              that Professor Bhaer, while talking philosophy with the father, 
              was giving the daughter lessons in love. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Jo couldn't even lose her heart in a decorous manner, but sternly 
              tried to quench her feelings, and failing to do so, led a somewhat 
              agitated life. She was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering, 
              after her many and vehement declarations of independence. Laurie 
              was her especial dread, but thanks to the new manager, he behaved 
              with praiseworthy propriety, never called Mr. Bhaer `a capital old 
              fellow' in public, never alluded, in the remotest manner, to Jo's 
              improved appearance, or expressed the least surprise at seeing the 
              Professor's hat on the Marches' table nearly every evening. But 
              he exulted in private and longed for the time to come when he could 
              give Jo a piece of plate, with a bear and a ragged staff on it as 
              an appropriate coat of arms. <br>
            </p>
            <p>For a fortnight, the Professor came and went with lover-like regularity. 
              Then he stayed away for three whole days, and made no sign, a proceeding 
              which caused everybody to look sober, and Jo to become pensive, 
              at first, and then--alas for romance--very cross. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Disgusted, I dare say, and gone home as suddenly as he came. 
              It's nothing tome, of course, but I should think he would have come 
              and bid us goodbye like a gentleman,&quot; she said to herself, 
              with a despairing look at the gate, as she put on her things for 
              the customary walk one dull afternoon. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You'd better take the little umbrella, dear. It looks like 
              rain,&quot; said her mother, observing that she had on her new bonnet, 
              but not alluding to the fact. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, Marmee, do you want anything in town? I've got to run 
              in and get some paper,&quot; returned Jo, pulling out the bow under 
              her chin before the glass as an excuse for not looking at her mother. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, I want some twilled silesia, a paper of number nine 
              needles, and two yards of narrow lavender ribbon. Have you got your 
              thick boots on, and something warm under your cloak?&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I believe so,&quot; answered Jo absently. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;If you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer, bring him home to tea. I 
              quite long to see the dear man,&quot; added Mrs. March. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Jo heard that, but made no answer, except to kiss her mother, and 
              walk rapidly away, thinking with a glow of gratitude, in spite of 
              her heartache, &quot;How good she is to me! What do girls do who 
              haven't any mothers to help them through their troubles?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>The dry-goods stores were not down among the counting-houses, banks, 
              and wholesale warerooms, where gentlemen most do congregate, but 
              Jo found herself in that part of the city before she did a single 
              errand, loitering along as if waiting for someone, examining engineering 
              instruments in one window and samples of wool in another, with most 
              unfeminine interest, tumbling over barrels,being half-smothered 
              by descending bales, and hustled unceremoniously by busy men who 
              looked as if they wondered `how the deuce she got there'. A drop 
              of rain on her cheek recalled her thoughts from baffled hopes to 
              ruined ribbons. For the drops continued to fall, and being a woman 
              as well as a lover, she felt that, though it was too late to save 
              her heart, she might her bonnet. Now she remembered the little umbrella, 
              which she had forgotten to take in her hurry to be off, but regret 
              was unavailing, and nothing could be done but borrow one or submit 
              to to a drenching. She looked up at the lowering sky, down at the 
              crimson bow already flecked with black, forward along the muddy 
              street, then one long, lingering look behind, at a certain grimy 
              warehouse, with `Hoffmann, Swartz, &amp; Co.' over the door, and 
              said to herself, with a sternly reproachful air... <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It serves me right! what business had I to put on all my 
              best things and come philandering down here, hoping to see the Professor? 
              Jo, I'm ashamed of you! No, you shall not go there to borrow an 
              umbrella, or find out where he is, from his friends. You shall trudge 
              away, and do your errands in the rain, and if you catch your death 
              and ruin your bonnet, it's no more than you deserve. Now then!&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>With that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she 
              narrowly escaped annihilation from a passing truck, and precipitated 
              herself into the arms of a stately old gentleman, who said, &quot;I 
              beg pardon, ma'am,&quot; and looked mortally offended. Somewhat 
              daunted, Jo righted herself, spread her handkerchief over the devoted 
              ribbons, and putting temptation behind her, hurried on, with increasing 
              dampness about the ankles, and much clashing of umbrellas overhead. 
              The fact that a somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary 
              above the unprotected bonnet attracted her attention, and looking 
              up, she saw Mr. Bhaer looking down. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely 
              under many horse noses, and so fast through much mus. What do you 
              down here, my friend?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm shopping.&quot; <br>
              Mr. Bhaer smiled, as he glanced from the pickle factory on one side 
              to the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other, but her 
              only said politely, &quot;You haf no umbrella. May I go also, and 
              take for you the bundles?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, thank you.&quot; <br>
              Jo's cheeks were as red as her ribbon, and she wondered what he 
              thought of her, but she didn't care, for in a minute she found herself 
              walking away arm in arm with her Professor, feeling as if the sun 
              had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the world 
              was all right again, and that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling 
              through the wet that day. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;We thought you had gone,&quot; said Jo hastily, for she knew 
              he was looking at her. Her bonnet wasn't big enough to hide her 
              face, and she feared he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those 
              who haf been so heavenly kind tome?&quot; he asked so reproachfully 
              that she felt as if she had insulted him by the suggestion, and 
              answered heartily... <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I didn't. I knew you were busy about your own affairs, 
              but we rather missed you, Father and Mother especially.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;And you?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm always glad to see you, sir.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>In her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm, Jo made it rather 
              cool, and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill 
              the Professor, for his smile vanished, as he said gravely... <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I thank you, and come one more time before I go.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;You are going, then?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I haf no longer any business here, it is done.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Successfully, I hope?&quot; said Jo, for the bitterness of 
              disappointment was in that short reply of his. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I ought to think so, for I haf a way opened to me by which 
              I can make my bread and gif my Junglings much help.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Tell me, please! I like to know all about the--the boys,&quot; 
              said Jo eagerly. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That is so kind, I gladly tell you. My friends find for mea 
              place in a college, where I teach as at home, and earn enough to 
              make the way smooth for Franz and Emil. For this I should be grateful, 
              should I not?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Indeed you should. How splendid it will be to have you doing 
              what you like, and be able to see you often, and the boys!&quot; 
              cried Jo, clinging to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction 
              she could not help betraying. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! But we shall not meet often, I fear, this place is at 
              the West.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;So far away!&quot; And Jo left her skirts to their fate, 
              as if it didn't matter now what became of her clothes or herself. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Bhaer could read several languages, but he had not learned 
              to read women yet. He flattered himself that he knew Jo pretty well, 
              and was, therefore, much amazed by the contradictions of voice, 
              face, and manner, which she showed him in rapid succession that 
              day, for she was in half a dozen different moods in the course of 
              half an hour. When she met him she looked surprised, though it was 
              impossible to help suspecting that she had come for that express 
              purpose. When he offered her his arm, she took it with a look that 
              filled him with delight, but when he asked if she missed him, she 
              gave such chilly,formalreplythatdespair fell upon him. On learning 
              his good fortune she almost clappedherhands. Was the joy all for 
              the boys? Then on hearing his destination, she said, &quot;So far 
              away!&quot; in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a pinnacle 
              of hope, but the next minute she tumbled him down again by observing, 
              like one entirely absorbed in the matter... <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Here's the place for my errands. Will you come in? It won't 
              take long.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              Jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities, and particularly 
              wished to impress her escort with the neatness and dispatch with 
              which she would accomplish the business. But owing to the flutter 
              she was in, everything went amiss. She upset the tray of needles, 
              forgot the silesia was to be `twilled' till it was cut off, gave 
              the wrong change, and covered herself with confusion by asking for 
              lavender ribbon at the calico counter. Mr. Bhaer stood by, watching 
              her blush and blunder, and as he watched, his own bewilderment seemed 
              to subside, for he was beginning to see that on some occasions, 
              women, like dreams, go by contraries. <br>
              <br>
              When they came out, he put the parcel under his arm with a more 
              cheerful aspect, and splashed through the puddles as if he rather 
              enjoyed it on the whole. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Should we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies, 
              and haf a farewell feast tonight if I go for my last call at your 
              so pleasant home?&quot; he asked, stopping before a window full 
              of fruit and flowers. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;What will we buy?&quot; asked Jo, ignoring the latter part 
              of his speech, and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation 
              of delight as they went in. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;May they haf oranges and figs?&quot; asked Mr. Bhaer, with 
              a paternal air. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;They eat them when they can get them.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Do you care for nuts?&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Like a squirrel.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Hamburg grapes. Yes, we shall drink to the Fatherland in those?&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              Jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance, and asked why he didn't 
              buy a frail of dated, a cask of raisins, and a bag of almonds, and 
              be done with it? Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her purse, produced 
              his own, and finished the marketing by buying several pounds of 
              grapes, a pot of rosy daisies, and a pretty jar of honey, to be 
              regarded in the light of a demijohn. Then distorting his pockets 
              with knobby bundles, and giving her the flowers to hold, he put 
              up the old umbrella, and they traveled on again. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Miss Marsch, I haf a great favor to ask of you,&quot; began 
              the Professor, after a moist promenade of half a block. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; And Jo's heart began to beat so hard she was 
              afraid he would hear it. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I am bold to say it in spite of the rain, because so short 
              a time remains to me.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; And Jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot 
              with the sudden squeeze she gave it. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I wish to get a little dress for my Tina, and I am too stupid 
              to go alone. Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; And JO felt as calm and cool all of a sudden 
              as if she had stepped into a refrigerator. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Perhaps also a shawl for Tina's mother, she is so poor and 
              sick, and the husband is such a care. Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl 
              would be a friendly thing to take the little mother.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I'll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer. I'm going very fast, 
              and he's getting dearer every minute,&quot; added Jo to herself, 
              then with a mental shake she entered into the business with an energy 
              that was pleasant to behold. Mr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she 
              chose a pretty gown for Tina, and then ordered out the shawls. The 
              clerk, being a married man, condescended to take an interest in 
              the couple, who appeared to be shopping for their family. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Your lady may prefer this. It's a superior article, a most 
              desirable color, quite chaste and genteel,&quot; he said, shaking 
              out a comfortable gray shawl, and throwing it over Jo's shoulders. 
              <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?&quot; she asked, turning her 
              back to him, and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding 
              her face. &quot;Excellently well, we will haf it,&quot; answered 
              the Professor, smiling to himself as he paid for it, while Jo continued 
              to rummage the counters like a confirmed bargain-hunter. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Now shall we go home?&quot; he asked, as if the words were 
              very pleasant to him. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Yes, it's late, and I'm so tired.&quot; Jo's voice was more 
              pathetic than she knew. For now the sun seemed to have gone in as 
              suddenly as it came out, and the world grew muddy and miserable 
              again, and for the first time she discovered that her feet were 
              cold, her head ached, and that her heart was colder than the former, 
              fuller of pain than the latter. Mr. Bhaer was going away, he only 
              cared for her as a friend, it was all a mistake, and the sooner 
              it was over the better. With this idea in her head, she hailed an 
              approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that the daisies flew 
              out of the pot and were badly damaged. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;This is not our omniboos,&quot; said the Professor, waving 
              the loaded vehicle away, and stopping to pick up the poor little 
              flowers. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I beg your pardon. I didn't see the name distinctly. Never 
              mind, I can walk. I'm used to plodding in the mud,&quot; returned 
              Jo, winking hard, because she would have died rather than openly 
              wipe her eyes. Mr. Bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks, though she 
              turned her head away. The sight seemed to touch him very much, for 
              suddenly stooping down, he asked in a tone that meant a great deal, 
              &quot;Heart's dearest, why do you cry?&quot; <br>
              <br>
              Now, if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have 
              said she wasn't crying, had a cold in her head, or told any other 
              feminine fib proper to the occasion. Instead of which, that undignified 
              creature answered, with an irrepressible sob, &quot;Because you 
              are going away.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Ach, mein Gott, that is so good!&quot; cried Mr. Bhaer, managing 
              to clasp his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles, &quot;Jo, 
              I haf nothing but much love to gif you. I came to see if you could 
              care for it, and I waited to be sure that I was something more than 
              a friend. Am I? Can you make a little place in your heart for old 
              Fritz?&quot; he added, all in one breath. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Oh, yes!&quot; said Jo, and he was quite satisfied, for she 
              folded both hands over his are, and looked up at him with an expression 
              that plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life 
              beside him, even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella, 
              if he carried it. <br>
              <br>
              It was certainly proposing under difficulties, for even if he had 
              desired to do so, Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his knees, on 
              account of the mud. Neither could he offer Jo his hand, except figuratively, 
              for both were full. Much less could he indulge in tender remonstrations 
              in the open street, though he was near it. So the only way in which 
              he could express his rapture was to look at her, with an expression 
              which glorified his face to such a degree that there actually seemed 
              to be little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his beard. If 
              he had not loved Jo very much, I don't think he could have doneit 
              then, for she looked far from lovely, with her skirts in a deplorable 
              state, her rubber boots splashed to the ankle, and her bonnet a 
              ruin. Fortunately, Mr. Bhaer considered her the most beautiful woman 
              living, and she found him more `Jove-like&quot; than ever, though 
              his hatbrim was quite limp with the little rills trickling thence 
              upon his shoulders (for he held the umbrella all over Jo), and every 
              finger of his gloves needed mending. <br>
              <br>
              Passers-by probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics, for 
              they entirely forgot to hail a bus, and strolledleisurely along, 
              oblivious of deepening dusk and fog. Little they cared what anybody 
              thought, for they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes 
              but once in any life, the magical moment which bestows youth on 
              the old, beauty on the plain, wealth on the poor, and gives human 
              hearts a foretaste of heaven. The Professor looked as if he had 
              conquered a kingdom, and the world had nothing more to offer him 
              in the way of bliss. While Jo trudged beside him, feeling as if 
              her place had always been there, and wondering how she ever could 
              have chosen any other lot. Of course, she was the first to speak--intelligibly, 
              I mean, for the emotional remarks which followed her impetuous </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; were not of a coherent or reportable character. 
              <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Friedrich, why didn't you...&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Ah, heaven, she gifs me the name that no one speaks since 
              Minna died!&quot; cried the Professor, pausing in a puddle to regard 
              her with grateful delight. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I always call you so to myself--I forgot, but I won't unless 
              you like it.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Like it? It is more sweet to me than I can tell. Say `thou', 
              also, and I shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine.&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Isn't `thou' a little sentimental?&quot; asked Jo, privately 
              thinking it a lovely monosyllable. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Sentimental? Yes. Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment, 
              and keep ourselves young mit it. Your English `you' is so cold, 
              say `thou', heart's dearest, it means so much to me,&quot; pleaded 
              Mr. Bhaer, more like a romantic student than a grave professor. 
              <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Well, then, why didn't thou tell me all this sooner?&quot; 
              asked Jo bashfully. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Now I shall haf to show thee all my heart, and I so gladly 
              will, because thou must take care of it hereafter. See, then, myJo--ah, 
              the dear, funny little name--I had a wish to tell something the 
              day I said goodbye in New York, but I thought the handsome friend 
              was betrothed to thee, and so I spoke not. Wouldst thou have said 
              `Yes', then, if I had spoken?&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I don't know. I'm afraid not, for I didn't have any heart 
              just then.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Prut! That I do not believe. It was asleep till the fairy 
              prince came through the wood, and waked it up. Ah, well, `Die erste 
              Liebe ist die beste', but that I should not expect.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Yes, the first love is the best, but be so contented, for 
              I never had another. Teddy was only a boy, and soon got over his 
              little fancy,&quot; said Jo, anxious to correct the Professor's 
              mistake. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Good! Then I shall rest happy, and be sure that thou givest 
              me all. I haf waited so long, I am grown selfish, as thou wiltfind 
              , Professorin.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I like that,&quot; cried Jo, delighted with her new name. 
              &quot;Now tell me what brought you, at last, just when I wanted 
              you?&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;This.&quot; And Mr. Bhaer took a little worn paper out of 
              his waistcoat pocket. <br>
              <br>
              Jo unfolded it, and looked much abashed, for it was one of her own 
              contributions to a paper that paid for poetry, which accounted for 
              her sending it an occasional attempt. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;How could that bring you?&quot; she asked, wondering what 
              he meant. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I found it by chance. I knew it by the names and the initials, 
              and in it there was one little verse that seemed to call me. Read 
              and find him. I will see that you go not in the wet.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              IN THE GARRET Four little chests all in a row, Dim with dust, and 
              worn by time, All fashioned and filled, long ago, By children now 
              in their prime. Four little keys hung side by side, With faded ribbons, 
              brave and gay When fastened there, with childish pride, Long ago, 
              on a rainy day. Four little names, one on each lid, Carved out by 
              a boyish hand, And underneath there lieth hid Histories of the happpy 
              band Once playing here, and pausing oft To hear the sweet refrain, 
              That came and went on the roof aloft, In the falling summer rain. 
              <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Meg&quot; on the first lid, smooth and fair. I look in with 
              loving eyes, For folded here, with well-known care, A goodly gathering 
              lies, The record of a peaceful life-- Gifts to gentle child and 
              girl, A bridal gown, lines to a wife, A tiny shoe, a baby curl. 
              No toys in this first chest remain, For all are carried away, In 
              their old age, to join again In another small Meg's play. Ah, happy 
              mother! Well I know You hear, like a sweet refrain, Lullabies ever 
              soft and low In the falling summer rain. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Jo&quot; on the next lid, scratched and worn, And within a 
              motley store Of headless, dolls, of schoolbooks torn, Birds and 
              beasts that speak no more, Spoils brought home from the fairy ground 
              Only trod by youthful feet, Dreams of a future never found, Memories 
              of a past still sweet, Half-writ poems, stories wild, April letters, 
              warm and cold, Diaries of a wilful child, Hints of a woman early 
              old, A woman in a lonely home, Hearing, like a sad refrain-- &quot;Be 
              worthy, love, and love will come,&quot; In the falling summer rain. 
              <br>
              <br>
              My Beth! the dust is always swept From the lid that bears your name, 
              As if by loving eyes that wept, By careful hands that often came. 
              Death cannonized for us one saint, Ever less human than divine, 
              And still we lay, with tender plaint, Relics in this household shrine-- 
              The silver bell, so seldom rung, The little cap which last she wore, 
              The fair, dead Catherine that hung By angels borne above her door. 
              The songs she sang, without lament, In her prison-house of pain, 
              Forever are they sweetly blent With the falling summer rain. <br>
              <br>
              Upon the last lid's polished field-- Legend now both fair and true 
              A gallant knight bears on his shield, &quot;Amy&quot; in letters 
              gold and blue. Within lie snoods that bound her hair, Slippers that 
              have danced their last, Faded flowers laid by with care, Fans whose 
              airy toils are past, Gay valentines, all ardent flames, Trifles 
              that have borne their part In girlish hopes and fears and shames, 
              The record of a maiden heart Now learning fairer, truer spells, 
              Hearing, like a blithe refrain, The silver sound of bridal bells 
              In the falling summer rain. <br>
              <br>
              Four little chests all in a row, Dim with dust, and worn by time, 
              Four women, taught by weal and woe To love and labor in their prime. 
              Four sisters, parted for an hour, None lost, one only gone before, 
              Made by love's immortal power, Nearest and dearest evermore. Oh, 
              when these hidden stores of ours Lie open to the Father's sight, 
              May they be rich in golden hours, Deeds that show fairer for the 
              light, Lives whose brave music long shall ring, Like a spirit-stirring 
              strain, Souls that shall gladly soar and sing In the long sunshine 
              after rain. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;It's very bad poetry, but I felt it when I wrote it, one day 
              when I was very lonely, and had a good cry on a rag bag. I never 
              thought it would go where it could tell tales,&quot; said Jo, tearing 
              up the verses the Professor had treasured so long. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Let it go, it has done it's duty, and I will haf a fresh one 
              when I read all the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets,&quot; 
              said Mr. Bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments fly away 
              on the wind. &quot;Yes,&quot; he added earnestly, &quot;I read that, 
              and I think to myself, She has a sorrow, she is lonely, she would 
              find comfort in true love. I haf a heart full, full for her. Shall 
              I not go and say, &quot;If this is not too poor a thing to gif for 
              what I shall hope to receive, take it in Gott's name?&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;And so you came to find that it was not too poor, but the 
              one precious thing I needed,&quot; whispered Jo. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I had no courage to think that at first, heavenly kind as 
              was your welcome to me. But soon I began to hope, and then I said, 
              `I will haf her if I die for it,' and so I will!&quot; cried Mr. 
              Bhaer, with a defiant nod, as if the walls of mist closing round 
              them were barriers which he was to surmount or valiantly knock down. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Jo thought that was splendid, and resolved to be worthy of her knight, 
              though he did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous array. 
              <br>
              <br>
              &quot;What made you stay away so long?&quot; she asked presently, 
              finding it so pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful 
              answers that she could not keep silent. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;It was not easy, but I could not find the heart to take you 
              from that so happy home until I could haf a prospect of one to gif 
              you, after much time, perhaps, and hard work. How could I ask you 
              to gif up so much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but 
              a little learning?&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I'm glad you are poor. I couldn't bear a rich husband,&quot; 
              said Jo decidedly, adding in a softer tone, &quot;Don't fear poverty. 
              I've known it long enough to lose my dread and be happy working 
              for those I love, and don't call yourself old--forty is the prime 
              of life. I couldn't help loving you if you were seventy!&quot; <br>
              <br>
              The Professor found that so touching that he would have been glad 
              of his handkerchief, if he could have got at it. As her couldn't, 
              Jo wiped his eyes for him, and said, laughing, as she took away 
              a bundle or two... <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I may be strong-minded, but no one can say I'm out of my sphere 
              now, for woman's special mission is supposed to be drying tears 
              and bearing burdens. I'm to carry my share, Friedrich, and help 
              to earn the home. Make up your mind to that, or I'll never go,&quot; 
              she added resolutely, as he tried to reclaim his load. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;We shall see. Haf you patience to wait a long time, Jo? I 
              must go away and do my work alone. I must help my boys first, because, 
              even for you, I may not break my word to Minna. Can you forgif that, 
              and be happy while we hope and wait?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, I know I can, for we love one another, and that makes 
              all the rest easy to bear. I have my duty, also, and my work. I 
              couldn't enjoy myself if I neglected them even for you, so there's 
              no need of hurry or impatience. You can do your part out West, I 
              can do mine here, and both be happy hoping for the best, and leaving 
              the future to be as God wills.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! Thou gifest me such hope and courage, and I haf nothing 
              to gif back but a full heart and these empty hands,&quot; cried 
              the Professor, quite overcome. </p>
            <p>Jo never, never would learn to be proper, for when he said that 
              as they stood upon the steps, she just put both hands into his, 
              whispering tenderly, &quot;Not empty now,&quot; and stooping down, 
              kissed her Friedrich under the umbrella. It was dreadful, but she 
              would have done it if the flock of draggle-tailed sparrows on the 
              hedge had been human beings, for she was very far gone indeed, and 
              quite regardless of everything but her own happiness. Though it 
              came in such a very simple guise, that was the crowning moment of 
              both their lives, when, turning from the night and storm and loneliness 
              to the household light and warmth and peace waiting to receive them, 
              with a glad &quot;Welcome home!&quot; Jo led her lover in, and shut 
              the door. </p>

            <p><br>
              For a year Jo and her Professor worked and waited, hoped and loved, 
              met occasionally, and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise 
              in the price of paper was accounted for, Laurie said. The second 
              year began rather soberly, for their prospects did not brighten, 
              and Aunt March died suddenly. But when their first sorrow was over--for 
              they loved the old lady in spite of her sharp tongue--they found 
              they had cause for rejoicing, for she had left Plumfield to Jo, 
              which made all sorts of joyful things possible. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's a fine old place, and will bring a handsome sum, for 
              of course you intend to sell it,&quot; said Laurie, as they were 
              all talking the matter over some weeks later. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I don't,&quot; was Jo's decided answer, as she petted 
              the fat poodle, whom she had adopted, out of respect to his former 
              mistress. </p>
            <p>&quot;You don't mean to live there?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, I do.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;But, my dear girl, it's an immense house, and will take a 
              power of money to keep it in order. The garden and orchard alone 
              need two or three men, and farming isn't in Bhaer's line, I take 
              it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;He'll try his hand at it there, if I propose it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;And you expect to live on the produce of the place? Well, 
              that sounds paradisiacal, but you'll find it desperate hard work.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;The crop we are going to raise is a profitable one,&quot; 
              And Jo laughed. </p>
            <p>&quot;Of what is this fine crop to consist, ma'am?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Boys. I want to open a school for little lads--a good, happy, 
              homelike school, with me to take care of them and Fritz to teach 
              them.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That's a truly Joian plan for you! Isn't that just like her?&quot; 
              cried Laurie, appealing to the family, who looked as much surprised 
              as he. </p>
            <p> &quot;I like it,&quot; said Mrs. March decidedly. </p>
            <p>&quot;So do I,&quot; added her husband, who welcomed the thought 
              of a chance for trying the Socratic method of education on modern 
              youth. </p>
            <p> &quot;It will be an immense care for Jo,&quot; said Meg, stroking 
              the head or her one all-absorbing son. </p>
            <p>&quot;Jo can do it, and be happy in it. It's a splendid idea. </p>
            <p>Tell us all about it,&quot; cried Mr. Laurence, who had been longing 
              to lend the lovers a hand, but knew that they would refuse his help. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I knew you'd stand by me, sir. Amy does too--I see it in 
              her eyes, though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind 
              before she speaks. Now, my dear people,&quot; continued Jo earnestly, 
              &quot;just understand that this isn't a new idea of mine, but a 
              long cherished plan. Before my Fritz came, I used to think how, 
              when I'd made my fortune, and no one needed me at home, I'd hire 
              a big house, and pick up some poor, forlorn little lads who hadn't 
              any mothers, and take care of them, and make life jolly for them 
              before it was too late. I see so many going to ruin for want of 
              help at the right minute, I love so to do anything for them, I seem 
              to feel their wants, and sympathize with their troubles, an oh, 
              I should so like to be a mother to them!&quot; <br>
              <br>
              Mrs. March held out her hand to Jo, who took it, smiling, with tears 
              in her eyes, and went on in the old enthusiastic way, which they 
              had not seen for a long while. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I told my plan to Fritz once, and he said it was just what 
              he would like, and agreed to try it when we got rich. Bless his 
              dear heart, he's been doing it all his life--helping poor boys, 
              I mean, not getting rich, that he'll never be. Money doesn't stay 
              in his pocket long enough to lay up any. But now, thanks to my good 
              old aunt, who loved me better than I ever deserved, I'm rich, at 
              least I feel so, and we can live at Plumfield perfectly well, if 
              we have a flourishing school. It's just the place for boys, the 
              house is big, and the furniture strong and plain. There's plenty 
              of room for dozens inside, and splendid grounds outside. </p>
            <p>They could help in the garden and orchard. Such work is healthy, 
              isn't it, sir? Then Fritz could train and teach in his own way, 
              and Father will help him. I can feed and nurse and pet and scold 
              them, and Mother will be my stand-by. I've always longed for lots 
              of boys, and never had enough, now I can fill the house full and 
              revel in the little dears to my heart's content. Think what luxury-- 
            </p>
            <p>Plumfield my own, and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me.&quot; 
              <br>
              As Jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture, the family went 
              off into a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till they 
              thought he'd have an apoplectic fit. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't see anything funny,&quot; she said gravely, when 
              she could be heard. &quot;Nothing could be more natural and proper 
              than for my Professor to open a school, and for me to prefer to 
              reside in my own estate.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;She is putting on airs already,&quot; said Laurie, who regarded 
              the idea in the light of a capital joke. &quot;But may I inquire 
              how you intend to support the establishment? If all the pupils are 
              little ragamuffins, I'm afraid your crop won't be profitable in 
              a worldly sense, Mr. Bhaer.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Now don't be a wet-blanket, Teddy. Of course I shall have 
              rich pupils, also--perhaps begin with such altogether. Then, when 
              I've got a start, I can take in a ragamuffin or two, just for a 
              relish. Rich people's children often need care and comfort, as well 
              as poor. I've seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants, 
              or backward ones pushed forward, when it's real cruelty. </p>
            <p>Some are naughty through mismanagment or neglect, and some lose 
              their mothers. Besides, the best have to get through the hobbledehoy 
              age, and that's the very time they need most patience and kindness. 
              People laugh at them, and hustle them about, try to keep them out 
              of sight, and expect them to turn all at once from pretty children 
              into fine young men. They don't complain much-- </p>
            <p>plucky little souls--but they feel it. I've been through some- 
              thing of it, and I know all about it. I've a special interest in 
              such young bears, and like to show them that I see the warm, honest, 
              well-meaning boys' hearts, in spite of the clumsy arms and legs 
              and the topsy-turvy heads. I've had experience, too, for haven't 
              I brought up one boy to be a pride and honor to his family?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll testify that you tried to do it,&quot; said Laurie with 
              a grateful look. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And I've succeeded beyond my hopes, for here you are, a steady, 
              sensible businessman, doing heaps of good with your </p>
            <p>money, and laying up the blessings of the poor, instead of dollars.</p>
            <p>But you are not merely a businessman, you love good and beautiful 
              things, enjoy them yourself, and let others go halves, as you always 
              did in the old times. I am proud of you, Teddy, for you get better 
              every year, and everyone feels it, though you won't let them say 
              so. Yes, and when I have my flock, I'll just point to you, and say 
              `There's your model, my lads'.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Poor Laurie didn't know where to look, for, man though he was, 
              something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of 
              praise made all faces turn approvingly upon him. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I say, Jo, that's rather too much,&quot; he began, just in 
              his old boyish way. &quot;You have all done more for me than I can 
              ever thank you for, except by doing my best not to disapoint you. 
              You have rather cast me off lately, Jo, but I've had the best of 
              help, nevertheless. So, if I've got on at all, you may thank these 
              two for it.&quot; And he laid one hand gently on his grandfather's 
              head, and the other on Amy's golden one, for the three were never 
              far apart. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do think that families are the most beautiful things in 
              all the world!&quot; burst out Jo, who was in an unusually up-lifted 
              frame of mind just then. &quot;When I have one of my own, I hope 
              it will be as happy as the three I know and love the best. If John 
              and my Fritz were only here, it would be quite a little heaven on 
              earth,&quot; she added more quietly. And that night when she went 
              to her room after a blissful evening of family counsels, hopes, 
              and plans, her heart was so full of happiness that she could only 
              calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed always near her own, and 
              thinking tender thoughts of Beth. </p>
            <p>It was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed to 
              happen in an unusually rapid and delightful manner. Almost before 
              she knew where she was, Jo found herself married and settled at 
              Plumfield. Then a family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms, 
              and flourished surprisingly, poor boys as well as rich, for Mr. 
              Laurence was continually finding some touching case of destitution, 
              and begging the Bhaers to take pity on the child, and he would gladly 
              pay a trifle for its support. In this way, the sly old gentleman 
              got round proud Jo, and furnished her with the style of boy in which 
              she most delighted. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Of course it was uphill work at first, and Jo made queer mistakes, 
              but the wise Professor steered her safely into calmer waters, and 
              the most rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end. How Jo did 
              enjoy her `wilderness of boys', and how poor, dear Aunt March would 
              have lamented had she been there to see the sacred precincts of 
              prim, well-ordered Plumfield overrun with Toms, Dicks, and Harrys! 
              There was a sort of poetic justice about it, after all, for the 
              old lady had been the terror of the boys for miles around, and now 
              the exiles feasted freely on forbidden plums, kicked up the gravel 
              with profane boots unreproved, and played cricket in the big field 
              where the irritable `cow with a crumpled horn' used to invite rash 
              youths to come and be tossed. It became a sort of boys' paradise, 
              and Laurie suggested that it should be called the `Bhaer-garten', 
              as a compliment to its master and appropriate to its inhabitants. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>It never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not lay 
              up a fortune, but it was just what Jo intended it to be-- `a happy, 
              homelike place for boys, who needed teaching, care, and kindness'. 
              Every room in the big house was soon full. Every little plot in 
              the garden soon had its owner. A regular menagerie appeared in barn 
              and shed, for pet animals were allowed. And three times a day, Jo 
              smiled at her Fritz from the head of a long table lined on either 
              side with rows of happy young faces, which all turned to her with 
              affectionate eyes, confiding words, and grateful hearts, full of 
              love for `Mother Bhaer'. She had boys enough now, and did not tire 
              of them, though they were not angels, by any means, and some of 
              them caused both Professor and Professorin much trouble and anxiety. 
              But her faith in the good spot which exists in the heart of the 
              naughtiest, sauciest, most tantalizing little ragamuffin gave her 
              patience, skill, and in time success, for no mortal boy could hold 
              out long with Father Bhaer shining on him as benevolently as the 
              sun, and Mother Bhaer forgiving him seventy times seven. Very precious 
              to Jo was the friendship of the lads, their penitent sniffs and 
              whispers after wrongdoing, their droll or touching little confidences, 
              their pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, and plans, even their misfortunes, 
              for they only endeared them to her all the more. There were slow 
              boys and bashful boys, feeble boys and riotous boys, boys that lisped 
              and boys that stuttered, one or two lame ones, and a merry little 
              quadroon, who could not be taken in elsewhere, but who was welcome 
              to the `Bhaer-garten', though some people predicted that his admission 
              would ruin the school. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Yes, Jo was a very happy woman there, in spite of hard work, much 
              anxiety, and a perpetual racket. She enjoyed it heartily and found 
              the applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the 
              world, for now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic 
              believers and admirers. As the years went on, two little lads of 
              her own came to increase her happiness--Rob, named for Grandpa, 
              and Teddy, a happy-go-lucky baby, who seemed to have inherited his 
              papa's sunshiny temper as well as his mother's lively spirit. How 
              they ever grew up alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery 
              to their grandma and aunts, but they flourished like dandelions 
              in spring, and their rough nurses loved and served them well. <br>
            </p>
            <p>There were a great many holidays at Plumfield, and one of the most 
              delightful was the yearly apple-picking. For then the Marches, Laurences, 
              Brookes. And Bhaers turned out in full force and made a day of it. 
              Five years after Jo's wedding, one of these fruitful festivals occurred, 
              a mellow October day, when the air was full of an exhilarating freshness 
              which made the spirits rise and the blood dance healthily in the 
              veins. The old orchard wore its holiday attire. Goldenrod and asters 
              fringed the mossy walls. Grasshoppers skipped briskly in the sere 
              grass, and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a feast. Squirrels 
              were busy with their small harvesting. Birds twittered their adieux 
              from the alders in the lane, and every tree stood ready to send 
              down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake. Everybody 
              was there. </p>
            <p>Everybody laughed and sang, climbed up and tumbled down. Everybody 
              declared that there never had been such a perfect day or such a 
              jolly set to enjoy it, and everyone gave themselves up to the simple 
              pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no such things 
              as care or sorrow in the world. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley, and 
              Columella to Mr. Laurence, while enjoying... <br>
            </p>
            <p> The gentle apple's winey juice. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout 
              Teutonic knight, with a pole for a lance, leading on the boys, who 
              made a hook and ladder company of themselves, and performed wonders 
              in the way of ground and lofty tumbling. Laurie devoted himself 
              to the little ones, rode his small daughter in a bushel-basket, 
              took Daisy up among the bird's nests, and kept adventurous Rob from 
              breaking his neck. Mrs. March and Meg sat among the apple piles 
              like a pair of Pomonas, sorting the contributions that kept pouring 
              in, while Amy with a beautiful motherly expression in her face sketched 
              the various groups, and watched over one pale lad, who sat adoring 
              her with his little crutch beside him. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Jo was in her element that day, and rushed about, with her gown 
              pinned up, and her hat anywhere but on her head, and her baby tucked 
              under her arm, ready for any lively adventure which might turn up. 
              Little Teddy bore a charmed life, for nothing ever happened to him, 
              and Jo never felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree 
              by one lad, galloped off on the back of another, or supplied with 
              sour russets by his indulgent papa, who labored under the Germanic 
              delusion that babies could digest anything, from pickled cabbage 
              to buttons, nails, and their own small shoes. She knew that little 
              Ted would turn up again in time, safe and rosy, dirty and serene, 
              and she always received him back with a hearty welcome, for Jo loved 
              her babies tenderly. <br>
            </p>
            <p>At four o'clock a lull took place, and baskets remained empty, 
              while the apple pickers rested and compared rents and bruises. Then 
              Jo and Meg, with a detachment of the bigger boys, set forth the 
              supper on the grass, for an out-of-door tea was always the crowning 
              joy of the day. The land literally flowed with milk and honey on 
              such occasions, for the lads were not required to sit at table, 
              but allowed to partake of refreshment as they liked--freedom being 
              the sauce best beloved by the boyish soul. They availed themselves 
              of the rare privilege to the fullest extent, for some tried the 
              pleasing experiment of drinking mild while standing on their heads, 
              others lent a charm to leapfrog by eating pie in the pauses of the 
              game, cookies were sown broadcast over the field, and apple turnovers 
              roosted in the trees like a new style of bird. The little girls 
              had a private tea party, and Ted roved among the edibles at his 
              own sweet will. <br>
            </p>
            <p>When no one could eat any more, the Professor proposed the first 
              regular toast, which was always drunk at such times--&quot;Aunt 
              March, God bless her!&quot; A toast heartily given by the good man, 
              who never forgot how much he owed her, and quietly drunk by the 
              boys, who had been taught to keep her memory green. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Now, Grandma's sixtieth birthday! Long life to her, with 
              three times three!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>That was given with a will, as you may well believe, and the cheering 
              once begun, it was hard to stop it. Everybody's health was proposed, 
              form Mr. Laurence, who was considered their special patron, to the 
              astonished guinea pig, who had strayed from its proper sphere in 
              search of its young master. Demi, as the oldest grandchild, then 
              presented the queen of the day with various gifts, so numerous that 
              they were transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow. Funny 
              presents, some of them, but what would have been defects to other 
              eyes were ornaments to Grandma's--for the children's gifts were 
              all their own. Every stitch Daisy's patient little fingers had put 
              into the handkerchiefs she hemmed was better than embroidery to 
              Mrs. March. Demi's miracle of mechanical skill, though the cover 
              wouldn't shut, Rob's footstool had a wiggle in its uneven legs that 
              she declared was soothing, and no page of the costly book Amy's 
              child gave her was so fair as that on which appeared in tipsy capitals, 
              the words-- </p>
            <p>&quot;To dear Grandma, from her little Beth.&quot; During the ceremony 
              the boys had mysteriously disappeared, and when Mrs. March had tried 
              to thank her children, and broken down, while Teddy wiped her eyes 
              on his pinafore, the Professor suddenly began to sing. Then, from 
              above him, voice after voice took up the words, and from tree to 
              tree echoed the music of the unseen choir, as the boys sang with 
              all their hearts the little song that Jo had written, Laurie set 
              to music, and the Professor trained his lads to give with the best 
              effect. This was something altogether new, and it proved a grand 
              success, for Mrs. March couldn't get over her surprise, and insisted 
              on shaking hands with every one of the featherless birds, from tall 
              Franz and Emil to the little quadroon, who had the sweetest voice 
              of all. </p>
            <p>After this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs. March 
              and her daughters under the festival tree. </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't think I ever ought to call myself `unlucky Jo' again, 
              when my greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified,&quot; said 
              Mrs. Bhaer, taking Teddy's little fist out of the milk pitcher, 
              in which he was rapturously churning. </p>
            <p>&quot;And yet your life is very different from the one you pictured 
              so long ago. Do you remember our castles in the air?&quot; asked 
              Amy, smiling as she watched Laurie and John playing cricket with 
              the boys. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Dear fellows! It does my heart good to see them forget business 
              and frolic for a day,&quot; answered Jo, who now spoke in a maternal 
              way of all mankind. &quot;Yes, I remember, but the life I wanted 
              then seems selfish, lonely, and cold to me now. I haven't given 
              up the hope that I may write a good book yet, but I can wait, and 
              I'm sure it will be all the better for such experiences and illustrations 
              as these.&quot; And Jo pointed from the lively lads in the distance 
              to her father, leaning on the Professor's arm, as they walked to 
              and fro in the sunshine, deep in one of the conversations which 
              both enjoyed so much, and then to her mother, sitting enthroned 
              among her daughters, with their children in her lap and at her feet, 
              as if all found help and happiness in the face which never could 
              grow old to them. </p>
            <p>&quot;My castle was the most nearly realized of all. I asked for 
              splendid things, to be sure, but in my heart I knew I should be 
              satisfied, if I had a little home, and John, and some dear children 
              like these. I've got them all, thank God, and am the happiest woman 
              in the world.&quot; And Meg laid her hand on her tall boy's head, 
              with a face full of tender and devout content. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My castle is very different from what I planned, but I would 
              not alter it, though, like Jo, I don't relinquish all my artistic 
              hopes, or confine myself to helping others fulfill their dreams 
              of beauty. I've begun to model a figure of baby, and Laurie says 
              it is the best thing I've ever done. I think so, myself, and mean 
              to do it in marble, so that, whatever happens, I may at least keep 
              the image of my little angel.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p> As Amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping 
              child in her arms, for her one well-beloved daughter was a frail 
              little creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over 
              Amy's sunshine. This cross was doing much for both father and mother, 
              for one love and sorrow bound them closely together. Amy's nature 
              was growing sweeter, deeper, and more tender. Laurie was growing 
              more serious, strong, and firm, and both were learning that beauty, 
              youth, good fortune, even love itself, cannot keep care and pain, 
              loss and sorrow, from the most blessed for ... </p>
            <p>Into each life some rain must fall, Some days must be dark and 
              sad and dreary. </p>
            <p>&quot;She is growing better, I am sure of it, my dear. Don't despond, 
              but hope and keep happy,&quot; said Mrs. March, as tenderhearted 
              Daisy stooped from her knee to lay her rosy cheek against her little 
              cousin's pale one. </p>
            <p>&quot;I never ought to, while I have you to cheer me up, Marmee, 
              and Laurie to take more than half of every burden,&quot; replied 
              Amy warmly. &quot;He never lets me see his anxiety, but is so sweet 
              and patient with me, so devoted to Beth, and such a stay and comfort 
              to me always that I can't love him enough. So, in spite of my one 
              cross, I can say with Meg, `Thank God, I'm a happy woman.'&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;There's no need for me to say it, for everyone can see that 
              I'm far happier than I deserve,&quot; added Jo, glancing from her 
              good husband to her chubby children, tumbling on the grass beside 
              her. &quot;Fritz is getting gray and stout. I'm growing as thin 
              as a shadow, and am thirty. We never shall be rich, and Plumfield 
              may burn up any night, for that incorrigible Tommy Bangs will smoke 
              sweet-fern cigars under the bed-clothes, though he's set himself 
              afire three times already. But in spite of these unromantic facts, 
              I have nothing to complain of, and never was so jolly in my life. 
              Excuse the remark, but living among boys, I can't help using their 
              expressions now and then.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, Jo, I think your harvest will be a good one,&quot; beganMrs. 
              March, frightening away a big black cricket that was staring Teddy 
              out of countenance. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not half so good as yours, Mother. Here it is, and we never 
              can thank you enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have 
              done,&quot; cried Jo, with the loving impetuosity which she never 
              would outgrow. </p>
            <p>&quot;I hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every year,&quot; 
              said Amy softly. </p>
            <p>&quot;A large sheaf, but I know there's room in your heart for 
              it, Marmee dear,&quot; added Meg's tender voice. </p>
            <p>Touched to the heart, Mrs. March could only stretch out her arms, 
              as if to gather children and grandchildren to herself, and say, 
              with face and voice full of motherly love, gratitude, and humility... 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Oh, my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish 
              you a greater happiness than this!&quot; <br>
            </p>

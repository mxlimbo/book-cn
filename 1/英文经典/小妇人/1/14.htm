              Jo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began to grow 
              chilly, and the afternoons were short. For two or three hours the 
              sun lay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old 
              sofa, writing busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk before 
              her, while Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, 
              accompanied by his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently 
              very proud of his whiskers. Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled 
              away till the last page was filled, when she signed her name with 
              a flourish and threw down her pen, exclaiming... </p>
            <p>&quot;There, I've done my best! If this won't suit I shall have 
              to wait till I can do better.&quot; </p>
            <p>Lying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully through, 
              making dashes here and there, and putting in many exclamation points, 
              which looked like little balloons. Then she tied it up with a smart 
              red ribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful 
              expression, which plainly showed how ernest her work had been. Jo's 
              desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall. 
              It it she kept her papers, and a few books, safely shut away from 
              Scrabble, who, being likewise of a literary turn, was fond of making 
              a circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating 
              the leaves. From this tin receptacle Jo produced another manuscript, 
              and putting both in her pocket, crept quietly downstairs, leaving 
              her friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink. </p>
            <p>She put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and going 
              to the back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, 
              swung herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way 
              to the road. Once there, she composed herself, hailed a passing 
              omnibus, and rolled away to town, looking very merry and mysterious. 
            </p>
            <p>If anyone had been watching her, he would have thought her movements 
              decidedly peculiar, for on alighting, she went off at a great pace 
              till she reached a certain number in a certain busy street. Having 
              found the place with some difficulty, she went into the doorway, 
              looked up the dirty stairs, and after standing stock still a minute, 
              suddenly dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she 
              came. This maneuver she repeated several times, to the great amusement 
              of a black-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building 
              opposite. On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake, 
              pulled her hat over her eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking 
              as if she were going to have all her teeth out. </p>
            <p>There was a dentist's sign, among others, which adorned the entrance, 
              and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which 
              slowly opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, 
              the young gentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down 
              to post himself in the opposite doorway, saying with a smile and 
              a shiver, &quot;It's like her to come alone, but if she has a bad 
              time she'll need someone to help her home.&quot; </p>
            <p>In ten minutes Jo came running downstairs with a very red face 
              and the general appearance of a person who had just passed through 
              a trying ordeal of some sort. When she saw the young gentleman she 
              looked anything but pleased, and passed him with a nod. But he followed, 
              asking with an air of sympathy, &quot;Did you have a bad time?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Not very.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You got through quickly.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, thank goodness!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Why did you go alone?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Didn't want anyone to know.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You're the oddest fellow I ever saw. How many did you have 
              out?&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him, then 
              began to laugh as if mightily amused at something. </p>
            <p>&quot;There are two which I want to have come out, but I must wait 
              a week.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;What are you laughing at? You are up to some mischief, Jo,&quot; 
              said Laurie, looking mystified. </p>
            <p>&quot;So are you. What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard 
              saloon?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Begging your pardon, ma'am, it wasn't a billiard saloon, 
              but a gymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm glad of that.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;why?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You can teach me, and then when we play HAMLET, you can be 
              Laertes, and we'll make a fine thing of the fencing scene.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Laurie burst out with a hearty boy's laugh, which made several 
              passers-by smile in spite of themselves. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll teach you whether we play HAMLET or not. It's grand 
              fun and will straighten you up capitally. But I don't believe that 
              was your only reason for saying `I'm glad' in that decided way, 
              was it now?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I 
              hope you never go to such places. Do you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Not often.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I wish you wouldn't.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;It's no harm, Jo. I have billiards at home, but it's no fun 
              unless you have good players, so, as I'm fond of it, I come sometimes 
              and have a game with Ned Moffat or some of the other fellows.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Oh, dear, I'm so sorry, for you'll get to liking it better 
              and better, and will waste time and money, and grow like those dreadful 
              boys. I did hope you'd stay respectable and be a satisfaction to 
              your friends,&quot; said Jo, shaking her head. </p>
            <p>&quot;Can't a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then 
              without losing his respectability?&quot; asked Laurie, looking nettled. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That depends upon how and where he takes it. I don't like 
              Ned and his set, and wish you'd keep out of it. Mother won't let 
              us have him at our house, though he wants to come. And if you grow 
              like him she won't be willing to have us frolic together as we do 
              now.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Won't she?&quot; asked Laurie anxiously. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, she can't bear fashionable young men, and she'd shut 
              us all up in bandboxes rather than have us associate with them.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Well, she needn't get out her bandboxes yet. I'm not a fashionable 
              party and don't mean to be, but I do like harmless larks now and 
              then, don't you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don't get wild, 
              will you? Or there will be an end of all our good times.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;I'll be a double distilled saint.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I can't bear saints. Just be a simple, honest, respectable 
              boy, and we'll never desert you. I don't know what I should do if 
              you acted like Mr. King's son. He had plenty of money, but didn't 
              know how to spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and 
              forged his father's name, I believe, and was altogether horrid.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You think I'm likely to do the same? Much obliged.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;No, I don't--oh, dear, no!--but I hear people talking about 
              money being such a temptation, and I sometimes wish you were poor. 
              I shouldn't worry then.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Do you worry about me, Jo?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;A little, when you look moody and discontented, as you sometimes 
              do, for you've got such a strong will, if you once get started wrong, 
              I'm afraid it would be hard to stop you.&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie walked in silence a few minutes, and Jo watched him, wishing 
              she had held her tongue, for his eyes looked angry, though his lips 
              smiled as if at her warnings. </p>
            <p>&quot;Are you going to deliver lectures all the way home?&quot; 
              he asked presently. </p>
            <p>&quot;Of course not. Why?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Because if you are, I'll take a bus. If you're not, I'd like 
              to walk with you and tell you something very interesting.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I won't preach any more, and I'd like to hear the news immensely.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very well, then, come on. It's a secret, and if I tell you, 
              you must tell me yours.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I haven't got any,&quot; began Jo, but stopped suddenly, 
              remembering that she had. </p>
            <p>&quot;You know you have--you can't hide anything, so up and fess, 
              or I won't tell,&quot; cried Laurie. </p>
            <p>&quot;Is your secret a nice one?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, isn't it! All about people you know, and such fun! You 
              ought to hear it, and I've been aching to tell it this long time. 
              Come, you begin.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You'll not say anything about it at home, will you?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Not a word.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;And you won't tease me in private?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I never tease.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, you do. You get everything you want out of people. I 
              don't know how you do it, but you are a born wheedler.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you. Fire away.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I've left two stories with a newspaperman, and he's 
              to give his answer next week,&quot; whispered Jo, in her confidant's 
              ear. </p>
            <p>&quot;Hurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!&quot; 
              cried Laurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again, to the 
              great delight of two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a dozen 
              Irish children, for they were out of the city now. &quot;Hush! It 
              won't come to anything, I dare say, but I couldn't rest till I had 
              tried, and I said nothing about it because I didn't want anyone 
              else to be disappointed.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;It won't fail. Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare 
              compared to half the rubbish that is published every day. Won't 
              it be fun to see them in print, and shan't we feel proud of our 
              authoress?&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo's eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed in, 
              and a friend's praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Where's your secret? Play fair, Teddy, or I'll never believe 
              you again,&quot; she said, trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes 
              that blazed up at a word of encouragement. </p>
            <p>&quot;I may get into a scrape for telling, but I didn't promise 
              not to, so I will, for I never feel easy in my mind till I've told 
              you any plummy bit of news I get. I know where Meg's glove is.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Is that all? said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded 
              and twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's quite enough for the present, as you'll agree when I 
              tell you where it is.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Tell, then.&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo's ear, which produced 
              a comical change. She stood and stared at him for a minute, looking 
              both surprised and displeased, then walked on, saying sharply, &quot;How 
              do you know?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Saw it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Where?' </p>
            <p>&quot;Pocket.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;All this time?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, isn't that romantic?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, it's horrid.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't you like it?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Of course I don't. It's ridiculous, it won't be allowed. 
              My patience! What would Meg say?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You are not to tell anyone. Mind that.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I didn't promise.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That was understood, and I trusted you.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I won't for the present, anyway, but I'm disgusted, 
              and wish you hadn't told me.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I thought you'd be pleased.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank 
              you.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You'll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you 
              away.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'd like to see anyone try it,&quot; cried Jo fiercely. </p>
            <p>&quot;So should I!&quot; And Laurie chuckled at the idea. </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't think secrets agree with me, I feel rumpled up in 
              my mind since you told me that,&quot; said Jo rather ungratefully. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Race down this hill with me, and you'll be all right,&quot; 
              suggested Laurie. </p>
            <p>No one was in sight, the smooth road sloped invitingly before her, 
              and finding the temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon leaving 
              hat and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran. Laurie 
              reached the goal first and was quite satisfied with the success 
              of his treatment, for his Atalanta came panting up with flying hair, 
              bright eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her 
              face. </p>
            <p>&quot;I wish I was a horse, then I could run for miles in this 
              splendid air, and not lose my breath. It was capital, but see what 
              a guy it's made me. Go, pick up my things, like a cherub, as you 
              are,&quot; said Jo, dropping down under a maple tree, which was 
              carpeting the bank with crimson leaves. </p>
            <p>Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and Jo 
              bundled up her braids, hoping no one would pass by till she was 
              tidy again. But someone did pass, and who should it be but Meg, 
              looking particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit, for 
              she had been making calls. </p>
            <p>&quot;What in the world are you doing here?&quot; she asked, regarding 
              her disheveled sister with well-bred surprise. </p>
            <p>&quot;Getting leaves,&quot; meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy 
              handful she had just swept up. </p>
            <p>&quot;And hairpins,&quot; added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into 
              Jo's lap. &quot;They grow on this road, Meg, so do combs and brown 
              straw hats.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You have been running, Jo. How could you? When will you stop 
              such romping ways?&quot; said Meg reprovingly, as she settled her 
              cuffs and smoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Never till I'm stiff and old and have to use a crutch. Don't 
              try to make me grow up before my time, Meg. It's hard enough to 
              have you change all of a sudden. Let me be a little girl as long 
              as I can.&quot; </p>
            <p>As she spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of 
              her lips, for lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting 
              to be a woman, and Laurie's secret made her dread the separation 
              which must surely come some time and now seemed very near. He saw 
              the trouble in her face and drew Meg's attention from it by asking 
              quickly, &quot;Where have you been calling, all so fine?&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;At the Gardiners', and Sallie has been telling me all about 
              Belle Moffat's wedding. It was very splendid, and they have gone 
              to spend the winter in Paris. Just think how delightful that must 
              be!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Do you envy her, Meg?&quot; said Laurie. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm afraid I do.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm glad of it!&quot; muttered Jo, tying on her hat with 
              a jerk. </p>
            <p>&quot;Why?&quot; asked Meg, looking surprised. </p>
            <p>&quot;Because if you care much about riches, you will never go 
              and marry a poor man,&quot; said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was 
              mutely warning her to mind what she said. </p>
            <p>&quot;I shall never `go and marry' anyone,&quot; observed Meg, 
              walking on with great dignity while the others followed, laughing, 
              whispering, skipping stones, and `behaving like children', as Meg 
              said to herself, though she might have been tempted to join them 
              if she had not had her best dress on. </p>
            <p>For a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were 
              quite bewildered. She rushed to the door when the postman rang, 
              was rude to Mr. Brooke whenever they met, would sit looking at Meg 
              with a woe-begone face, occasionally jumping up to shake and then 
              kiss her in a very mysterious manner. Laurie and she were always 
              making signs to one another, and talking about `Spread Eagles' till 
              the girls declared they had both lost their wits. On the second 
              Saturday after Jo got out of the window, Meg, as she sat sewing 
              at her window, was scandalized by the sight of Laurie chasing Jo 
              all over the garden and finally capturing her in Amy's bower. What 
              went on there, Meg could not see, but shrieks of laughter were heard, 
              followed by the murmur of voices and a great flapping of newspapers. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What shall we do with that girl? She never will behave like 
              a young lady,&quot; sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a disapproving 
              face. </p>
            <p>&quot;I hope she won't. She is so funny and dear as she is,&quot; 
              said Beth, who had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at 
              Jo's having secrets with anyone but her. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's very trying, but we never can make her commy la fo,&quot; 
              added Amy, who sat making some new frills for herself, with her 
              curls tied up in a very becoming way., two agreeable things that 
              made her feel unusually elegant and ladylike. </p>
            <p>In a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa, and affected 
              to read.</p>
            <p>&quot;Have you anything interesting there?&quot; asked Meg, with 
              condescension. </p>
            <p>&quot;Nothing but a story, won't amount to much, I guess,&quot; 
              returned Jo, carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You'd better read it aloud. That will amuse us and keep you 
              out of mischief,&quot; said Amy in her most grown-up tone. </p>
            <p>&quot;What's the name?&quot; asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept 
              her face behind the sheet. </p>
            <p>&quot;The Rival Painters.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That sounds well. Read it,&quot; said Meg. </p>
            <p>With a loud &quot;Hem!&quot; and a long breath, Jo began to read 
              very fast. The girls listened with interest, for the tale was romantic, 
              and somewhat pathetic, as most of the characters died in the end. 
              &quot;I like that about the splendid picture,&quot; was Amy's approving 
              remark, as Jo paused. </p>
            <p>&quot;I prefer the lovering part. Viola and Angelo are two of our 
              favorite names, isn't that queer?&quot; said Meg, wiping her eyes, 
              for the lovering part was tragical. </p>
            <p>&quot;Who wrote it?&quot; asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse 
              of Jo's face. </p>
            <p>The reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying a flushed 
              countenance, and with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement 
              replied in a loud voice, &quot;Your sister.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You?&quot; cried Meg, dropping her work. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's very good,&quot; said Amy critically. </p>
            <p>&quot;I knew it! I knew it! Oh, my Jo, I am so proud!&quot; And 
              Beth ran to hug her sister and exult over this splendid success. 
            </p>
            <p>Dear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure! How Meg wouldn't 
              believe it till she saw the words. &quot;Miss Josephine March,&quot; 
              actually printed in the paper. How graciously Amy critisized the 
              artistic parts of the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which 
              unfortunately couldn't be carried out, as the hero and heroine were 
              dead. How Beth got excited, and skipped and sang with joy. How Hannah 
              came in to exclaim, &quot;Sakes alive, well I never!&quot; in great 
              astonishment at `that Jo's doin's'. How proud Mrs. March was when 
              she knew it. How Jo laughed, with tears in her eyes, as she declared 
              she might as well be a peacock and done with it. and how th `Spread 
              Eagle' might be said to flap his wings triumphantly over the House 
              of March, as the paper passed from hand to hand. </p>
            <p>&quot;Tell us about it.&quot; &quot;When did it come?&quot; &quot;How 
              much did you get for it?&quot; &quot;What will Father say?&quot; 
              &quot;Won't Laurie laugh?&quot; cried the family, all in one breath 
              as they clustered about Jo, for these foolish, affectionate people 
              mad a jubilee of every little household joy. </p>
            <p>&quot;Stop jabbering, girls, and I'll tell you everything,&quot; 
              said Jo, wondering if Miss Burney felt any grander over her Evilina 
              than she did over her `Rival Painters'. Having told how she disposed 
              of her tales, Jo added, &quot;And when I went to get my answer, 
              the man said he liked them both, but didn't pay beginners, only 
              let them print in his paper, and noticed the stories. It was good 
              practice, he said, and when the beginners improved, anyone would 
              pay. So I let him have the two stories, and today this was sent 
              to me, and Laurie caught me with it and insisted on seeing it, so 
              I let him. And he said it was good, and I shall write more, and 
              he's going to get the next paid for, and I am so happy, for in time 
              I may be able to support myself and help the girls.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo's breath gave out here, and wrapping her head in the paper, 
              she bedewed her little story with a few natural tears, for to be 
              independent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest 
              wishes of her heart, and this seemed to be the first step toward 
              that happy end. </p>

              Like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed. 
              The invalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began to talk or returning 
              early in the new year. Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa 
              all day, amusing herself with the well-beloved cats at first, and 
              in time with doll's sewing, which had fallen sadly behindhand. Her 
              once active limbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her for 
              a daily airing about the house in her strong arms. Meg cheerfully 
              blackened and burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for 
              `the dear', while Amy, a loyal slave of the ring, celebrated her 
              return by giving away as many of her treasures as she could prevail 
              on her sisters to accept. </p>
            <p>As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the 
              house, and Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly 
              impossible or magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this 
              unusually merry Christmas. Laurie was equally impracticable, and 
              would have had bonfires, skyrockets, and triumphal arches, if he 
              had had his own way. After many skirmishes and snubbings, the ambitious 
              pair were considered effectually quenched and went about with forlorn 
              faces, which were rather belied by explosions of laughter when the 
              two got together. </p>
            <p>Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid 
              Christmas Day. Hannah `felt in her bones' that it was going to be 
              an unusually fine day, and she proved herself a true prophetess, 
              for everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success. 
              To begin with, Mr. March wrote that he should soon be with them, 
              then Beth felt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed 
              in her mother's gift, a soft crimson merino wrapper, was borne in 
              high triumph to the window to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie. 
              The Unquenchables had done their best to be worthy of the name, 
              for like elves they had worked by night and conjured up a comical 
              surprise. Out in the garden stood a stately snow maiden, crowned 
              with holly, bearing a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand, a 
              great roll of music in the other, a perfect rainbow of an Afghan 
              round her chilly shoulders, and a Christmas carol issuing from her 
              lips on a pink paper streamer. </p>
            <p><br>
              THE JUNGFRAU TO BETH </p>
            <p>God bless you, dear Queen Bess! <br>
              May nothing you dismay, <br>
              But health and peace and happiness <br>
              Be yours, this Christmas day. <br>
              Here's fruit to feed our busy bee, <br>
              And flowers for her nose. <br>
              Here's music for her pianee, <br>
              An afghan for her toes, </p>
            <p>A portrait of Joanna, see, <br>
              By Raphael No. 2, <br>
              ho laboured with great industry <br>
              To make it fair and true. </p>
            <p>Accept a ribbon red, I beg, <br>
              For Madam Purrer's tail, <br>
              And ice cream made by lovely Peg, <br>
              A Mont Blanc in a pail. </p>
            <p>Their dearest love my makers laid <br>
              Within my breast of snow. <br>
              Accept it, and the Alpine maid, <br>
              From Laurie and from Jo. </p>
            <p><br>
              How Beth laughed when she saw it, how Laurie ran up and down to 
              bring in the gifts, and what ridiculous speeches Jo made as she 
              presented them.</p>
            <p>&quot;I'm so full of happiness, that if Father was only here, I 
              couldn't hold one drop more,&quot; said Beth, quite sighing with 
              contentment as Jo carried her off to the study to rest after the 
              excitement, and to refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes 
              the `Jungfrau' had sent her. </p>
            <p>&quot;So am I,&quot; added Jo, slapping the pocket wherein reposed 
              the long-desired UNDINE AND SINTRAM. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm sure I am,&quot; echoed Amy, poring over the engraved 
              copy of the Madonna and Child, which her mother had given her in 
              a pretty frame. </p>
            <p>&quot;Of course I am!&quot; cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds 
              of her first sild dress, for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving 
              it. &quot;How can I be otherwise?&quot; said Mrs. March gratefully, 
              as her eyes went from her husband's letter to Beth's smiling face, 
              and her hand carressed the brooch made of gray and golden, chestnut 
              and dark brown hair, which the girls had just fastened on her breast. 
            </p>
            <p>Now and then, in this workaday world, things do happen in the delightful 
              storybook fashion, and what a comfort it is. Half an hour after 
              everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one drop 
              more, the drop came. Laurie opened the parlor door and popped his 
              head in very quietly. He might just as well have turned a somersault 
              and uttered an Indian war whoop, for his face was so full of suppressed 
              excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped 
              up, though he only said, in a queer, breathless voice, &quot;Here's 
              another Christmas present for the March family.&quot; </p>
            <p>Before the words were well out of his mouth, he was whisked away 
              somehow, and in his place appeared a tall man, muffled up to the 
              eyes, leaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say something 
              and couldn't. Of course there was a general stampede, and for several 
              minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the strangest things 
              were done, and no one said a word. </p>
            <p>Mr. March became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving 
              arms. Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away, and had to be 
              doctored by Laurie in the china closet. Mr. Brooke kissed Meg entirely 
              by mistake, as he somewhat incoherently explained. And Amy, the 
              dignified, tumbled over a stool, and never stopping to get up, hugged 
              and cried over her father's boots in the most touching manner. Mrs. 
              March was the first to recover herself, and held up her hand with 
              a warning, &quot;Hush! Remember Beth.&quot; </p>
            <p>But it was too late. The study door flew open, the little red wrapper 
              appeared on the threshold, joy put strength into the feeble limbs, 
              and Beth ran straight into her father's arms. Never mind what happened 
              just after that, for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the 
              bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present. 
            </p>
            <p>It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight 
              again, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the 
              fat turkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed 
              up from the kitchen. As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to 
              thank Mr. Brooke for his faithful care of her husband, at which 
              Mr. Brooke suddenly remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and seizing 
              Laurie, he precipitately retired. Then the two invalids were ordered 
              to repose, which they did, by both sitting in one big chair and 
              talking hard. </p>
            <p>Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when 
              the fine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor, to take 
              advantage of it, how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether 
              a most estimable and upright young man. Why Mr. March paused a minute 
              just there, and after a glance at Meg, who was violently poking 
              the fire, looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, 
              I leave you to imagine. Also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head 
              and asked, rather abruptly, if he wouldn't like to have something 
              to eat. Jo saw and understood the look, and she stalked grimly away 
              to get wine and beef tea, muttering to herself as she slammed the 
              door, &quot;I hate estimable young men with brown eyes!&quot; </p>
            <p>There never was such a Christmas dinner as they had that day. The 
              fat turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed, 
              browned, and decorated. So was the plum pudding, which melted in 
              one's mouth, likewise the jellies, in which Amy reveled like a fly 
              in a honeypot. Everything turned out well, which was a mercy, Hannah 
              said, &quot;For my mind was that flustered, Mum, that it's a merrycle 
              I didn't roast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let 
              alone bilin' of it in a cloth.&quot; </p>
            <p>Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke, 
              at whom Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement. Two 
              easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table, in which 
              sat Beth and her father, feasting modestly on chicken and a little 
              fruit. They drank healths, told stories, sang songs, `reminisced', 
              as the old folks say, and had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh ride 
              had been planned, but the girls would not leave their father, so 
              the guests departed early, and as twilight gathered, the happy family 
              sat together round the fire. </p>
            <p>&quot;Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas 
              we expected to have. Do you remember?&quot; asked Jo, breaking a 
              short pause which had followed a long conversation about many things. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Rather a pleasant year on the whole!&quot; said Meg, smiling 
              at the fire, and congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke 
              with dignity. </p>
            <p>&quot;I think it's been a pretty hard one,&quot; observed Amy, 
              watching the light shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes. </p>
            <p>&quot;i'm glad it's over, because we've got you back,&quot; whispered 
              Beth, who sat on her father's knee. </p>
            <p>&quot;Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, 
              especially the latter part of it. But you have got on bravely, and 
              I think the burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon,&quot; 
              said Mr. March, looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young 
              faces gathered round him. </p>
            <p>&quot;How do you know? Did Mother tell you?' asked Jo. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not much. Straws show which way the wind blows, and I've 
              made several discoveries today.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, tell us what they are!&quot; cried Meg, who sat beside 
              him. </p>
            <p>&quot;Here is one.&quot; And taking up the hand which lay on the 
              arm of his chair, he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn 
              on the back, and two or three little hard spots on the palm. &quot;I 
              remember a time when this hand was white and smooth, and your first 
              care was to keep it so. It was very pretty then, but to me it is 
              much prettier now, for in this seeming blemishes I read a little 
              history. A burnt offering has been made to vanity, this hardened 
              palm has earned something better than blisters, and I'm sure the 
              sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long time, so much 
              good will went into the stitches. Meg, my dear, I value the womanly 
              skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or fashionable 
              accomplishments. I'm proud to shake this good, industrious little 
              hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it away.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received 
              it in the hearty pressure of her father's hand and the approving 
              smile he gave her. </p>
            <p>&quot;What about Jo? Please say something nice, for she has tried 
              so hard and been so very, very good to me,&quot; said Beth in her 
              father's ear. </p>
            <p>He laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, 
              with and unusually mild expression in her face.</p>
            <p>&quot;In spite of the curly crop, I don't see the `son Jo' whom 
              I left a year ago,&quot; said Mr. March. &quot;I see a young lady 
              who pins her collar straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither 
              whistles, talks slang, nor lies on the rug as she used to do. Her 
              face is rather thin and pale just now, with watching and anxiety, 
              but I like to look at it, for it has grown gentler, and her voice 
              is lower. She doesn't bounce, but moves quietly, and takes care 
              of a certain little person in a motherly way which delights me. 
              I rather miss my wild girl, but if I get a strong, helpful, tenderhearted 
              woman in her place, I shall feel quite satisfied. I don't know whether 
              the shearing sobered our black sheep, but I do know that in all 
              Washington I couldn't find anything beautiful enough to be bought 
              with the five-and-twenty dollars my good girl sent me.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo's keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin face 
              grew rosy in the firelight as she received her father's praise, 
              feeling that she did deserve a portion of it. </p>
            <p>&quot;Now, Beth,&quot; said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready 
              to wait. </p>
            <p>&quot;There's so little of her, I'm afraid to say much, for fear 
              she will slip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used 
              to be,&quot; began their father cheerfully. But recollecting how 
              nearly he had lost her, he held her close, saying tenderly, with 
              her cheek against his own, &quot;I've got you safe, my Beth, and 
              I'll keep you so, please God.&quot; </p>
            <p>After a minute's silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on the 
              cricket at his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining hair... 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands 
              for her mother all the afternoon, gave Meg her place tonight, and 
              has waited on every on with patience and good humor. I also observe 
              that she does not fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even 
              mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears, so I conclude that 
              she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less, 
              and has decided to try and mold her character as carefully as she 
              molds her little clay figures. I am glad of this, for though I should 
              be very proud of a graceful statue made by her, I shall be infinitely 
              prouder of a lovable daughter with a talent for making life beautiful 
              to herself and others.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;What are you thinking of, Beth?&quot; asked Jo, when Amy 
              had thanked her father and told about her ring. </p>
            <p>&quot;I read in PILGRIM'S PROGRESS today how, after many troubles, 
              christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies 
              bloomed all year round, and there they rested happily, as we do 
              now, before they went on to their journey's end,&quot; answered 
              Beth, adding, as she slipped out of her father's arms and went to 
              the instrument, &quot;It's singing time now, and I want to be in 
              my old place. I'll try to sing the song of the shepherd boy which 
              the Pilgrims heard. I made the music for Father, because he likes 
              the verses.&quot; </p>
            <p>So, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the keys, 
              and in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again, sang 
              to her own accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a singularly 
              fitting song for her. </p>
            <p>He that is down need fear no fall, <br>
              He that is low no pride. <br>
              He that is humble ever shall <br>
              Have God to be his guide. </p>
            <p>I am content with what I have, <br>
              Little be it, or much. <br>
              And, Lord! Contentment still I crave, <br>
              Because Thou savest such. </p>
            <p>Fulness to them a burden is, <br>
              That go on pilgrimage. <br>

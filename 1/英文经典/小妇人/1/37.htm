              <br>
              At three o'clock in the afternoon, all the fashionable world at 
              Nice may be seen on the Promenade des Anglais--a charming place, 
              for the wide walk, bordered with palms, flowers, and tropical shrubs, 
              is bounded on one side by the sea, on the other by the grand drive, 
              lined with hotels and villas, while beyond lie orange orchards and 
              the hills. Many nations are represented, many languages spoken, 
              many costumes worn, and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and 
              brilliant as a carnival. Haughty English, lively French, sober Germans, 
              handsome Spaniards, ugly Russians, meek Jews, free-and-easy Americans, 
              all drive, sit, or saunter here, chatting over the news, and criticzing 
              the latest celebrity who has arrived--Ristori or Dickens, Victor 
              Emmanuel or the Queen of the Sandwich Islands. The equipages are 
              as varied as the company and attract as much attention, especially 
              the low basket barouches in which ladies drive themselves, with 
              a pair of dashing ponies, gay nets to keep their voluminous flounces 
              from overflowing the diminutive vehicles, and little grooms on the 
              perch behind. </p>
            <p>Along this walk, on Christmas Day, a tall young man walked slowly, 
              with his hands behind him, and a somewhat absent expression of countenance. 
              He looked like an Italian, was dressed like an Englishman, and had 
              the independent air of an American--a combination which caused sundry 
              pairs of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him, and sundry 
              dandies in black velvet suits, with rose-colored neckties, buff 
              gloves, and orange flowers in their buttonholes, to shrug their 
              shoulders, and then envy him his inches. There were plenty of pretty 
              faces to admire, but the young man took little notice of them, except 
              to glance now and then at some blonde girl in blue. Presently he 
              strolled out of the promenade and stood a moment at the crossing, 
              as if undecided whether to go and listen to the band in the Jardin 
              Publique, or to wander along the beach toward Castle Hill. The quick 
              trot of ponies feet made him look up, as one of the little carriages, 
              containing a single young lady, came rapidly down the street. The 
              lady was young, blonde, and dressed in blue. He stared a minute, 
              then his whole face woke up, and, waving his hat like a boy, he 
              hurried forward to meet her. </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, Laurie, is it really you? I thought you'd never come!&quot; 
              cried Amy, dropping the reins and holding out both hands, to the 
              great scandalization of a French mamma, who hastened her daughter's 
              steps, lest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners 
              of these `mad English'. </p>
            <p>&quot;I was detained by the way, but I promised to spend Christmas 
              with you, and here I am.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;How is your grandfather? When did you come? Where are you 
              staying?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Very well--last night--at the Chauvain. I called at your 
              hotel, but you were out.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I have so much to say, I don't know where to begin! Get in 
              and we can talk at our ease. I was going for a drive and longing 
              for company. Flo's saving up for tonight.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;What happens then, a ball?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;A Christmas party at out hotel. There are many Americans 
              there, and they give it in honor of the day. You'll go with us, 
              of course? Aunt will be charmed.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you. Where now?&quot; asked Laurie, leaning back and 
              folding his arms, a proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred to 
              drive, for her parasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies 
              backs afforded her infinite satisfaction. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm going to the bankers first for letters, and then to Castle 
              Hill. The view is so lovely, and I like to feed the peacocks. Have 
              you ever been there?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Often, years ago, but I don't mind having a look at it.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Now tell me all about yourself. The last I heard of you, 
              your grandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin.&quot; &quot;Yes, 
              I spent a month there and then joined him in Paris, where he has 
              settled for the winter. He has friends there and finds plenty to 
              amuse him, so I go and come, and we got on capitally.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;That's a sociable arrangement,&quot; said Amy, missing something 
              in Laurie's manner, though she couldn't tell what. </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, you see, he hates to travel, and I hate to keep still, 
              so we each suit ourselves, and there is no trouble. I am often with 
              him, and he enjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that someone 
              is glad to see me when I get back from my wanderings. Dirty old 
              hole, isn't it?&quot; he added, with a look of disgust as they drove 
              along the boulevard to the Place Napoleon in the old city. </p>
            <p>&quot;The dirt is picturesque, so I don't mind. The river and the 
              hills are delicious, and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets 
              are my delight. Now we shall have to wait for that procession to 
              pass. It's going to the Church of St. John.&quot; </p>
            <p>While Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under 
              their canopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, and some 
              brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked, Amy watched him, and 
              felt a new sort of shyness steal over her, for he was changed, and 
              she could not find the merry-faced boy she left in the moody-looking 
              man beside her. He was handsomer than ever and greatly improved, 
              she thought, but now that the flush of pleasure at meeting her was 
              over, he looked tired and spiritless--not sick, nor exactly unhappy, 
              but older and graver than a year or two of prosperous life should 
              have made him. She couldn't understand it and did not venture to 
              ask questions, so she shook her head and touched up her ponies, 
              as the procession wound away across the arches of the Paglioni bridge 
              and vanished in the church. </p>
            <p>&quot;Que pensez-vous?&quot; she said, airing her French, which 
              had improved in quantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;That mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the 
              result is charming,&quot; replied Laurie, bowing with his hand on 
              his heart and an admiring look. </p>
            <p>She blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did not satisfy 
              her like the blunt praises he used to give her at home, when he 
              promenaded round her on festival occasions, and tole her she was 
              `altogether jolly', with a hearty smile and an approving pat on 
              the head. She didn't like the new tone, for though not blase, it 
              sounded indifferent in spite of the look. </p>
            <p> &quot;If that's the way he's going to grow up, I wish he's stay 
              a boy,&quot; she thought, with a curious sense of disappointment 
              and discomfort, trying meantime to seem quite easy and gay. </p>
            <p>At Avigdor's she found the precious home letters and, giving the 
              reins to Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady 
              road between green hedges, where tea roses bloomed as freshly as 
              in June. </p>
            <p>&quot;Beth is very poorly, Mother says. I often think I ought to 
              go home, but they all say `stay'. So I do, for I shall never have 
              another chance like this,&quot; said Amy, looking sober over one 
              page. </p>
            <p>&quot;I think you are right, there. You could do nothing at home, 
              and it is a great comfort to them to know that you are well and 
              happy, and enjoying so much, my dear.&quot; </p>
            <p>He drew a little nearer, and looked more like his old self as he 
              said that, and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy's heart was 
              lightened, for the look, the act, the brotherly `my dear', seemed 
              to assure her that if any trouble did come, she would not be alone 
              in a strange land. Presently she laughed and showed him a small 
              sketch of Jo in her scribbling suit, with the bow rampantly erect 
              upon her cap, and issuing from her mouth the words, `Genius burns!'. 
            </p>
            <p>Laurie smiled, took it, put it in his vest pocket `to keep it from 
              blowing away', and listened with interest to the lively letter Amy 
              read him.</p>
            <p>&quot;This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents 
              in the morning, you and letters in the afternoon, and a party at 
              night,&quot; said Amy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old 
              fort, and a flock of splendid peacocks came trooping about them, 
              tamely waiting to be fed. While Amy stood laughing on the bank above 
              him as she scattered crumbs to the brilliant birds, Laurie looked 
              at her as she had looked at him, with a natural curiosity to see 
              what changes time and absence had wrought. He found nothing to perplex 
              or disappoint, much to admire and approve, for overlooking a few 
              little affectations of speech and manner, she was as sprightly and 
              graceful as ever, with the addition of that indescribable something 
              in dress and bearing which we call elegance. Always mature for her 
              age, she had gained a certain aplomb in both carriage and conversation, 
              which made her seem more of a woman of the world than she was, but 
              her old petulance now and then showed itself, her strong will still 
              held its own, and her native frankness was unspoiled by foreign 
              polish. </p>
            <p>Laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks, 
              but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him, and carried away 
              a pretty little picture of a bright-faced girl standing in the sunshine, 
              which brought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh color of 
              her cheeks, the golden gloss of her hair, and made her a prominent 
              figure in the pleasant scene. </p>
            <p>As they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill, Amy 
              waved her hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt, and said, 
              pointing here and there, &quot;Do you remember the Cathedral and 
              the Corso, the fishermen dragging their nets in the bay, and the 
              lovely road to Villa Franca, Schubert's Tower, just below, and best 
              of all, that speck far out to sea which they say ils Corsica?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I remember. It's not much changed,&quot; he answered without 
              enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>&quot;What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck!&quot; 
              said Amy, feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; was all he said, but he turned and strained his 
              eyes to see the island which a greater usurper than even Napoleon 
              now made interesting in his sight. </p>
            <p>&quot;Take a good look at it for her sake, and then come and tell 
              me what you have been doing with yourself all this while,&quot; 
              said Amy, seating herself, ready for a good talk. </p>
            <p>But she did not get it, for though he joined her and answered all 
              her questions freely, she could only learn that he had roved about 
              the Continent and been to Greece. So after idling away an hour, 
              they drove home again, and having paid his respects to Mrs. Carrol, 
              Laurie left them, promising to return in the evening. </p>
            <p>It must be recorded of Amy that she deliberately prinked that night. 
              Time and absence had done its work on both the young people. She 
              had seen her old friend in a new light, not as `our boy', but as 
              a handsome and agreeable man, and she was conscious of a very natural 
              desire to find favor in his sight. Amy knew her good points, and 
              made the most of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune 
              to a poor and pretty woman. </p>
            <p>Tarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she enveloped herself 
              in them on such occasions, and following the sensible English fashion 
              of simple dress for young girls, got up charming little toilettes 
              with fresh flowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices, 
              which were both inexpensive and effective. It must be confessed 
              that the artist sometimes got possession of the woman, and indulged 
              in antique coiffures, statuesque attitudes, and classic draperies. 
              But, dear heart, we all have out little weaknesses, and find it 
              easy to pardon such in the young, who satisfy our eyes with their 
              comeliness, and keep our hearts merry with their artless vanities. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I do want him to think I look well, and tell them so at 
              home,&quot; said Amy to herself, as she put on Flo's old white silk 
              ball dress, and covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of 
              which her white shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic 
              effect. Her hair she had the sense to let alone, after gathering 
              up the thick waves and curls into a Hebe-like knot at the back of 
              her head. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's not the fashion, but it's becoming, and I can't afford 
              to make a fright of myself,&quot; she used to say, when advised 
              to frizzle, puff, or braid, as the latest style commanded. </p>
            <p>Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion, Amy 
              looped her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and framed 
              the white shoulders in delicate green vines. Remembering the painted 
              boots, she surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction, 
              and chassed down the room, admiring her aristocratic feet all by 
              herself. </p>
            <p>&quot;My new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm, 
              and the real lace on Aunt's mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress. 
              If I only had a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy,&quot; 
              she said, surveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in 
              each hand. </p>
            <p>In spite of this affliction, she looked unusually gay and graceful 
              as she glided away. She seldom ran--it did not suit her style, she 
              thought, for being tall, the stately and Junoesque was more appropriate 
              than the sportive or piquante. She walked up and down the long saloon 
              while waiting for Laurie, and once arranged herself under the chandelier, 
              which had a good effect upon her hair, then she thought better of 
              it, and went away to the other end of the room, as if ashamed of 
              the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one. It so 
              happened that she could not have done a better thing, for Laurie 
              came in so quietly she did not hear him, and as she stood at the 
              distant window, with her head half turned and one hand gathering 
              up her dress, the slender, white figure against the red curtains 
              was as effective as a well-placed statue. </p>
            <p>&quot;Good evening, Diana!&quot; said Laurie, with the look of 
              satisfaction she liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Good evening, Apollo!&quot; she answered, smiling back at 
              him, for he too looked unusually debonair, and the thought of entering 
              the ballroom on the arm of such a personable man caused Amy to pity 
              the four plain Misses Davis from the bottom of her heart. </p>
            <p>&quot;Here are your flowers. I arranged them myself, remembering 
              that you didn't like what Hannah calls a `sot-bookay', said Laurie, 
              handing her a delicate nosegay, in a holder that she had long coveted 
              as she daily passed it in Cardiglia's window. </p>
            <p> &quot;How kind you are!&quot; she exclaimed gratefully. &quot;If 
              I'd known you were coming I'd have had something ready for you today, 
              though not as pretty as this, I'm afraid.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you. It isn't what it should be, but you have improved 
              it,&quot; he added, as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Please don't.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I thought you liked that sort of thing.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Not from you, it doesn't sound natural, and I like your old 
              bluntness better.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm glad of it,&quot; he answered, with a look of relief, 
              then buttoned her gloves for her, and asked if his tie was straight, 
              just as he used to do when they went to parties together at home. 
            </p>
            <p>The company assembled in the long salle a manger that evening was 
              such as one sees nowhere but on the Continent. The hospitable Americans 
              had invited every acquaintance they had in Nice, and having no prejudice 
              against titles, secured a few to add luster to their Christmas ball. 
            </p>
            <p>A Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and 
              talk with a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet's mother in black 
              velvet with a pearl bridle under her chin. A Polish count, aged 
              eighteen, devoted himself to the ladies, who pronounced him, `a 
              fascinating dear', and a German Serene Something, having come to 
              supper alone, roamed vaguely about, seeking what he might devour. 
              Baron Rothschild's private secretary, a largenosed Jew in tight 
              boots, affably beamed upon the world, as if his master's name crowned 
              him with a golden halo. A stout Frenchman, who knew the Emperor, 
              came to indulge his mania for dancing, and Lady de Jones, a British 
              matron, adorned the scene with her little family of eight. Of course, 
              there were many light-footed, shrill-voiced American girls, handsome, 
              lifeless-looking English ditto, and a few plain but piquante French 
              demoiselles, likewise the usual set of traveling young gentlemen 
              who disported themselves gaily, while mammas of all nations lined 
              the walls and smiled upon them benignly when they danced with their 
              daughters. </p>
            <p>Any young girl can imagine Amy's state of mind when she `took the 
              stage' that night, leaning on Laurie's arm. She knew she looked 
              well, she loved to dance, she felt that her foot was on her native 
              heath in a ballroom, and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which 
              comes when young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom 
              they are born to rule by virtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood. 
              She did pity the Davis girls, who were awkward, plain, and destitute 
              of escort, except a grim papa and three grimmer maiden aunts, and 
              she bowed to them in her friendliest manner as she passed, which 
              was good of her, as it permitted them to see her dress, and burn 
              with curiosity to know who her distinguished-looking friend might 
              be. With the first burst of the band, Amy's color rose, her eyes 
              began to sparkle, and her feet to tap the floor impatiently, for 
              she danced well and wanted Laurie to know it. Therefore the shock 
              she received can better be imagined than described, when he said 
              in a perfectly tranquil tone, &quot;Do you care to dance?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;One usually does at a ball.&quot; </p>
            <p>Her amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair his error 
              as fast as possible.</p>
            <p>&quot;I meant the first dance. May I have the honor?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I can give you one if I put off the Count. He dances devinely, 
              but he will excuse me, as you are an old friend,&quot; said Amy, 
              hoping that the name would have a good effect, and show Laurie that 
              she was not to be trifled with. &quot;Nice little boy, but rather 
              a short Pole to support . .. A daughter of the gods, Devinely tall, 
              and most devinely fair,&quot;</p>
            <p>was all the satisfaction she got, however. </p>
            <p>The set in which they found themselves was composed of English, 
              and Amy was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillion, feeling 
              all the while as if she could dance the tarantella with relish. 
              Laurie resigned her to the `nice little boy', and went to do his 
              duty to Flo, without securing Amy for the joys to come, which reprehensible 
              want of forethought was properly punished, for she immediately engaged 
              herself till supper, meaning to relent if he then gave any signs 
              penitence. She showed him her ball book with demure satisfaction 
              when he strolled instead of rushed up to claim her for the next, 
              a glorious polka redowa. But his polite regrets didn't impose upon 
              her, and when she galloped away with the Count, she saw Laurie sit 
              down by her aunt with an actual expression of relief. </p>
            <p>That was unpardonable, and Amy took no more notice of him for a 
              long while, except a word now and then when she came to her chaperon 
              between the dances for a necessary pin or a moment's rest. Her anger 
              had a good effect, however, for she hid it under a smiling face, 
              and seemed unusually blithe and brilliant. Laurie's eyes followed 
              her with pleasure, for she neither romped nor sauntered, but danced 
              with spirit and grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should 
              be. He very naturally fell to studying her from this new point of 
              view, and before the evening was half over, had decided that `little 
              Amy was going to make a very charming woman'. </p>
            <p>It was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social season 
              took possession of everyone, and Christmas merriment made all faces 
              shine, hearts happy, and heels light. The musicians fiddled, tooted, 
              and banged as if they enjoyed it, everybody danced who could, and 
              those who couldn't admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth. 
              The air was dark with Davises, and many Jones gamboled like a flock 
              of young giraffes. The golden secretary darted through the room 
              like a meteor with a dashing frenchwoman who carped the floor with 
              her pink satin train. The serene Teuton found the supper table and 
              was happy, eating steadily through the bill of fare, and dismayed 
              the garcons by the ravages he committed. But the Emperor's friend 
              covered himself with glory, for he danced everything, whether he 
              knew it or not, and introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures 
              bewildered him. The boyish abandon of that stout man was charming 
              to behold, for though he `carried weight', he danced like an India-rubber 
              ball. He ran, he flew, he pranced, his face glowed, his bald head 
              shown, his coattails waved wildly, his pumps actually twinkled in 
              the air, and when the music stopped, he wiped the drops from his 
              brow, and beamed upon his fellow men like a French Pickwick without 
              glasses. </p>
            <p>Amy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but 
              more graceful agility, and Laurie found himself involuntarily keeping 
              time to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they 
              flew by as indefatigably as if winged. When little Vladimir finally 
              relinquished her, with assurances that he was `desolated to leave 
              so early', she was ready to rest, and see how her recreant knight 
              had borne his punishment. </p>
            <p>It had been successful, for at three-and-twenty, blighted affections 
              find a balm in friendly society, and young nerves will thrill, young 
              blood dance, and healthy young spirits rise, when subjected to the 
              enchantment of beauty, light, music, and motion. Laurie had a waked-up 
              look as he rose to give her his seat, and when he hurried away to 
              bring her some supper, she said to herself, with a satisfied smile, 
              &quot;Ah, I thought that would do him good!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You look like Balzac's `FEMME PEINTE PAR ELLE-NENE',&quot; 
              he said, as he fanned her with one hand and held her coffee cup 
              in the other. </p>
            <p>&quot;My rouge won't come off.&quot; And Amy rubbed her brilliant 
              cheek, and showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that 
              made him laugh outright. </p>
            <p>&quot;What do you call this stuff?&quot; he asked, touching a fold 
              of her dress that had blown over his knee. </p>
            <p>&quot;Illusion.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Good name for it. It's very pretty--new thing, isn't it?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;It's as old as the hills. You have seen it on dozens of 
              girls, and you never found out that it was pretty till now? Stupide!&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I never saw it on you before, which accounts for the mistake, 
              you see.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;None of that, it is forbidden. I'd rather take coffee than 
              compliments just now. No, don't lounge, it makes me nervous.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Laurie sat bold upright, and meekly took her empty plate feeling 
              an odd sort of pleasure in having `little Amy' order him about, 
              for she had lost her shyness now, and felt an irrestible desire 
              to trample on him, as girls have a delightful way of doing when 
              lords of creation show any signs of subjection. </p>
            <p> &quot;Where did you learn all this sort of thing?&quot; he asked 
              with a quizzical look. </p>
            <p>&quot;As `this sort of thing' is rather a vague expression, would 
              you kindly explain?&quot; returned Amy, knowing perfectly well what 
              he meant, but wickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Well--the general air, the style, the self-possession, the-- 
              the--illusion--you know&quot;, laughed Laurie, breaking down and 
              helping himself out of his quandary with the new word. </p>
            <p>Amy was gratified, but of course didn't show it, and demurely answered, 
              &quot;Foreign life polishes one in spite of one's self. I study 
              as well as play, and as for this&quot;--with a little gesture toward 
              her dress--&quot;why, tulle is cheap, posies to be had for nothing, 
              and I am used to making the most of my poor little things.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Amy rather regretted that last sentence, fearing it wasn't in good 
              taste, but Laurie liked her better for it, and found himself both 
              admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of 
              opportunity, and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers. 
              Amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly, now why he filled 
              up her book with his own name, and devoted himself to her for the 
              rest of the evening in the most delightful manner, but the impulse 
              that wrought this agreeable change was the result of one of the 
              new impressions which both of them were unconsciously giving and 
              receiving. </p>

              The June roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that 
              morning, rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine, 
              like friendly little neighbors, as they were. Quite flushed with 
              excitement were their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind, whispering 
              to one another what they had seen, for some peeped in at the dining 
              room windows where the feast was spread, some climbed up to nod 
              and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride, others waved 
              a welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden, 
              porch, and hall, and all, from the rosiest full-blown flower to 
              the palest baby bud, offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance 
              to the gentle mistress who had loved and tended them so long. </p>
            <p>Meg looked very like a rose herself, for all that was best and 
              sweetest in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day, 
              making it fair and tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty. 
              Neither silk, lace, nor orange flowers would she have. &quot;I don't 
              want a fashionable wedding, but only those about me whom I love, 
              and to them I wish to look and be my familiar self.&quot; </p>
            <p>So she made her wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender 
              hopes and innocent romances of a girlish heart. her sisters braided 
              up her pretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies 
              of the valley, which `her John' liked best of all the flowers that 
              grew. </p>
            <p>&quot;You do look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet 
              and lovely that I should hug you if it wouldn't crumple your dress,&quot; 
              cried Amy, surveying her with delight when all was done. </p>
            <p>&quot;Then I am satisfied. But please hug and kiss me, everyone, 
              and don't mind my dress. I want a great many crumples of this sort 
              put into it today.&quot; And Meg opened her arms to her sisters, 
              who clung about her with April faces for a minute, feeling that 
              the new love had not changed the old. </p>
            <p>&quot;Now I'm going to tie John's cravat for him, and then to stay 
              a few minutes with Father quietly in the study.&quot; And Meg ran 
              down to perform these little ceremonies, and then to follow her 
              mother wherever she went, conscious that in spite of the smiles 
              on the motherly face, there was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly 
              heart at the flight of the first bird from the nest. </p>
            <p>As the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches to 
              their simple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few changes 
              which three years have wrought in their appearance, for all are 
              looking their best just now. </p>
            <p>Jo's angles are much softened, she has learned to carry herself 
              with ease, if not grace. The curly crop has lengthened into a thick 
              coil, more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure. There 
              is a fresh color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her eyes, 
              and only gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today. </p>
            <p>Beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever. The beautiful, 
              kind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression that saddens 
              one, although it is not sad itself. It is the shadow of pain which 
              touches the young face with such pathetic patience, but Beth seldom 
              complains and always speaks hopefully of `being better soon'. </p>
            <p>Amy is with truth considered `the flower of the family', for at 
              sixteen she has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman, not beautiful, 
              but possessed of that indescribable charm called grace. One saw 
              it in the lines of her figure, the make and motion of her hands, 
              the flow of her dress, the droop of her hair, unconscious yet harmonious, 
              and as attractive to many as beauty itself. Amy's nose still afflicted 
              her, for it never would grow Grecian, so did her mouth, being too 
              wide, and having a decided chin. These offending features gave character 
              to her whole face, but she never could see it, and consoled herself 
              with her wonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls 
              more golden and abundant than ever. </p>
            <p>All three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for 
              the summer), with blush roses in hair and bosom, and all three looked 
              just what they were, fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls, pausing a 
              moment in their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest 
              chapter in the romance of womanhood.</p>
            <p>There were to be no ceremonious performances, everything was to 
              be as natural and homelike as possible, so when Aunt March arrived, 
              she was scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and 
              lead her in, to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that 
              had fallen down, and to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister 
              marching upstairs with a grave countenance and a wine bottle under 
              each arm. </p>
            <p>&quot;Upon my word, here's a state of things!&quot; cried the old 
              lady, taking the seat of honor prepared for her, and settling the 
              folds of her lavender moire with a great rustle. &quot;You oughtn't 
              to be seen till the last minute, child.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm not a show, Aunty, and no one is coming to stare at me, 
              to criticize my dress, or count the cost of my luncheon. I'm too 
              happy to care what anyone says or thinks, and I'm going to have 
              my little wedding just as I like it. John, dear, here's your hammer.&quot; 
              And away went Meg to help `that man' in his highly improper employment. 
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brooke didn't even say, &quot;Thank you,&quot; but as he stooped 
              for the unromantic tool, he kissed his little bride behind the folding 
              door, with a look that made Aunt March whisk out her pocket handkerchief 
              with a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes. </p>
            <p>A crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the indecorous 
              exclamation, &quot;Jupiter Ammon! Jo's upset the cake again!&quot; 
              caused a momentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of 
              cousins arrived, and `the party came in', as Beth used to say when 
              a child. </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't let that young giant come near me, he worries me worse 
              than mosquitoes,&quot; whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms 
              filled and Laurie's black head towered above the rest. </p>
            <p>&quot;He has promised to be very good today, and he can be perfectly 
              elegant if he likes,&quot; returned Amy, and gliding away to warn 
              Hercules to beware of the dragon, which warning caused him to haunt 
              the old lady with a devotion that nearly distracted her. </p>
            <p>There was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon 
              the room as Mr. March and the young couple took their places under 
              the green arch. Mother and sisters gathered close, as if loath to 
              give Meg up. The fatherly voice broke more than once, which only 
              seemed to make the service more beautiful and solemn. The bridegroom's 
              hand trembled visibly, and no one heard his replies. But Meg looked 
              straight up in her husband's eyes, and said, &quot;I will!&quot; 
              with such tender trust in her own face and voice that her mother's 
              heart rejoiced and Aunt March sniffed audibly. </p>
            <p>Jo did not cry, though she was very near it once, and was only 
              saved from a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was 
              staring fixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and 
              emotion in his wicked black eyes. Beth kept her face hidden on her 
              mother's shoulder, but Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a 
              most becoming ray of sunshine touching her white forehead and the 
              flower in her hair. </p>
            <p>It wasn't at all the thing, I'm afraid, but the minute she was 
              fairly married, Meg cried, &quot;The first kiss for Marmee!&quot; 
              and turning, gave it with her heart on her lips. During the next 
              fifteen minutes she looked more like a rose than ever, for everyone 
              availed themselves of their privileges to the fullest extent, from 
              Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who, adorned with a headdress fearfully 
              and wonderfully made, fell upon her in the hall, crying with a sob 
              and a chuckle, &quot;Bless you, deary, a hundred times! The cake 
              ain't hurt a mite, and everything looks lovely.&quot; </p>
            <p>Everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant, 
              or tried to, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when 
              hearts are light. There was no display of gifts, for they were already 
              in the little house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a 
              plentiful lunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr. Laurence 
              and Aunt March shrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, 
              and coffee were found to be to only sorts of nectar which the three 
              Hebes carried around. No one said anything, till Laurie, who insisted 
              on serving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver 
              in his hand and a puzzled expression on his face. </p>
            <p>&quot;Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?&quot; he whispered, 
              &quot;or am I merely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying 
              about loose this morning?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, your grandfather kindly offered us his best, and Aunt 
              March actually sent some, but Father put away a little for Beth, 
              and dispatched the rest to the Soldier's Home. You know he thinks 
              that wine should be used only in illness, and Mother says that neither 
              she nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under 
              her roof.&quot; </p>
            <p>Meg spoke seriously and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh, 
              but he did neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in his 
              impetuous way, &quot;I like that! For I've seen enough harm done 
              to wish other women would think as you do.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You are not made wise by experience, I hope?&quot; And there 
              was an anxious accent in Meg's voice. </p>
            <p>&quot;No. I give you my word for it. Don't think too well of me, 
              either, this is not one of my temptations. Being brought up where 
              wine is as common as water and almost as harmless, I don't care 
              for it, but when a pretty girl offers it, one doesn't like to refuse, 
              you see.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own. 
              Come, Laurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this 
              the happiest day of my life.&quot; </p>
            <p>A demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a 
              moment, for ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial. Meg 
              knew that if he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs, 
              and feeling her power, used it as a woman may for her friend's good. 
              She did not speak, but she looked up at him with a face made very 
              eloquent by happiness, and a smile which said, &quot;No one can 
              refuse me anything today.&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie certainly could not, and with an answering smile, he gave 
              her his hand, saying heartily, &quot;I promise, Mrs. Brooke!&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I thank you, very, very much.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;And I drink `long life to your resolution', Teddy,&quot; 
              cried Jo, baptizing him with a splash of lemonade, as she waved 
              her glass and beamed approvingly upon him. </p>
            <p>So the toast was drunk, the pledge made and loyally kept in spite 
              of many temptations, for with instinctive wisdom, the girls seized 
              a happy moment to do their friend a service, for which he thanked 
              them all his life.</p>
            <p>After lunch, people strolled about, by twos and threes, through 
              the house and garden, enjoying the sunshine without and within. 
              Meg and John happened to be standing together in the middle of the 
              grass plot, when Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put 
              the finishing touch to this unfashionable wedding. </p>
            <p>&quot;All the married people take hands and dance round the new-made 
              husband and wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters 
              prance in couples outside!&quot; cried Laurie, promenading down 
              the path with Amy, with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone 
              else followed their example without a murmur. Mr. and Mrs. March, 
              Aunt and Uncle Carrol began it, others rapidly joined in, even Sallie 
              Moffat, after a moment's hesitation, threw her train over her arm 
              and whisked Ned into the ring. But the crowning joke was Mr. Laurence 
              and Aunt March, for when the stately old gentleman chass'ed solemnly 
              up to the old lady, she just tucked her cane under arm, and hopped 
              briskly away to join hands with the rest and dance about the bridal 
              pair, while the young folks pervaded the garden like butterflies 
              on a midsummer day. </p>
            <p>Want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then 
              people began to go. </p>
            <p>&quot;I wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well, but I 
              think you'll be sorry for it,&quot; said Aunt March to Meg, adding 
              to the bridegroom, as he led her to the carriage, &quot;You've got 
              a treasure, young man, see that you deserve it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That is the prettiest wedding I've been to for an age, Ned, 
              and I don't see why, for there wasn't a bit of style about it,&quot; 
              observed Mrs. Moffat to her husband, as they drove away. </p>
            <p>&quot;Laurie, my lad, if you ever want to indulge in this sort 
              of thing, get one of those little girls to help you, and I shall 
              be perfectly satisfied,&quot; said Mr. Laurence, settling himself 
              in his easy chair to rest after the excitement of the morning. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll do my best to gratify you, Sir,&quot; was Laurie's unusually 
              dutiful reply, as he carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his 
              buttonhole. </p>
            <p>The little house was not far away, and the only bridal journey 
              Meg had was the quiet walk with John from the old home to the new. 
              When she came down, looking like a pretty Quakeress in her dovecolored 
              suit and straw bonnet tied with white, they all gathered about her 
              to say goodby, as tenderly as if she had been going to make the 
              grand tour. </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't feel that I am separated from you, Marmee dear, or 
              that I love you any the less for loving John so much,&quot; she 
              said, clinging to her mother, with full eyes for a moment. &quot;I 
              shall come every day, Father, and expect to keep my old place in 
              all your hearts, though I am married. Beth is going to be with me 
              a great deal, and the other girls will drop in now and then to laugh 
              at my housekeeping struggles. Thank you all for my happy wedding 
              day. Goodby, goodby!&quot; </p>
            <p>They stood watching her, with faces full of love and hope and tender 
              pride as she walked away, leaning on her husband's arm, with her 
              hands full of flowers and the June sunshine brightening her happy 
              face--and so Meg's married life began. </p>

              Beth did have the fever, and was much sicker than anyone but Hannah 
              and the doctor suspected. The girls knew nothing about illness, 
              and Mr. Laurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had everything 
              her own way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a good deal 
              to the excellent nurse. Meg stayed at home, lest she should infect 
              the Kings, and kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty 
              when she wrote letters in which no mention was made of Beth's illness. 
              She could not think it right to deceive her mother, but she had 
              been bidden to mind Hannah, and Hannah wouldn't hear of `Mrs. March 
              bein' told, and worried just for sech a trifle.' </p>
            <p>Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night, not a hard task, for 
              Beth was very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long 
              as she could control herself. But there came a time when during 
              the fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play 
              on the coverlet as if on her beloved little piano, and try to sing 
              with a throat so swollen that there was no music left, a time when 
              she did not know the familiar faces around her, but addressed them 
              by wrong names, and called imploringly for her mother. Then Jo grew 
              frightened, Meg begged to be allowed to write the truth, and even 
              Hannah said she `would think of it, though there was no danger yet'. 
              A letter from Washington added to their trouble, for Mr. March had 
              had a relapse, and could not think of coming home for a long while. 
            </p>
            <p>How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and 
              how heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited, 
              while the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home. Then 
              it was that Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on 
              her work, felt how rich she had been in things more precious than 
              any luxuries money could buy--in love, protection, peace, and health, 
              the real blessings of life. Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened 
              room, with that suffering little sister always before her eyes and 
              that pathetic voice sounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty 
              and to sweetness of Beth's nature, to feel how deep and tender a 
              place she filled in all hearts, and to acknowledge the worth of 
              Beth's unselfish ambition to live for others, and make home happy 
              by that exercise of those simple virtues which all may possess, 
              and which all should love and value more than talent, wealth, or 
              beauty. And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly to be at home, that 
              she might work for Beth, feeling now that no service would be hard 
              or irksome, and remembering, with regretful grief, how many neglected 
              tasks those willing hands had done for her. Laurie haunted the house 
              like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locke the grand piano, because 
              he could not bear to be reminded of the young neighbor who used 
              to make the twilight pleasant for him. Everyone missed Beth. The 
              milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she did, poor Mrs. 
              Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to get a shroud 
              for Minna, the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and good wishes, 
              and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how many 
              friends shy little Beth had made. </p>
            <p>Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for even 
              in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege. She longed 
              for her cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should 
              get sick, and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about Jo. 
              She sent loving messages to Amy, bade them tell her mother that 
              she would write soon, and often begged for pencil and paper to try 
              to say a word, that Father might not think she had neglected him. 
              But soon even these intervals of consciousness ended, and she lay 
              hour after hour, tossing to and fro, with incoherent words on her 
              lips, or sank into a heavy sleep which brought her no refreshment. 
              Dr. Bangs came twice a day, Hannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram 
              in her desk all ready to send off at any minute, and Jo never stirred 
              from Beth's side. </p>
            <p>The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter 
              wind blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready for 
              its death. When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, 
              held the hot hand in both his own for a minute, and laid it gently 
              down, saying, in a low voice to Hannah, &quot;If Mrs. March can 
              leave her husband she'd better be sent for.&quot; </p>
            <p>Hannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously, 
              Meg dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of 
              her limbs at the sound of those words, and Jo, standing with a pale 
              face for a minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, 
              and throwing on her things, rushed out into the storm. She was soon 
              back, and while noiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in 
              with a letter, saying that Mr. March was mending again. Jo read 
              it thankfully, but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her 
              heart, and her face was so full of misery that Laurie asked quickly, 
              &quot;What is it? Is Beth worse?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I've sent for Mother,&quot; said Jo, tugging at her rubber 
              boots with a tragic expression. </p>
            <p>&quot;Good for you, Jo! Did you do it on your own responsibility?&quot; 
              asked Laurie, as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the 
              rebellious boots, seeing how her hands shook. </p>
            <p>&quot;No. The doctor told us to.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, Jo, it's not so bad as that?&quot; cried Laurie, with 
              a startled face. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, it is. She doesn't know us, she doesn't even talk about 
              the flocks of green doves, as she calls the vine leaves on the wall. 
              She doesn't look like my Beth, and there's nobody to help us bear 
              it. Mother and father both gone, and God seems so far away I can't 
              find Him.&quot; </p>
            <p>As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo's cheeks, she stretched 
              out her hand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark, 
              and Laurie took it in his, whispering as well as he could with a 
              lump in his throat, &quot;I'm here. Hold on tome, Jo, dear!&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>She could not speak, but she did `hold on', and the warm grasp 
              of the friendly human hand comforted her sore heart, and seemed 
              to lead her nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her 
              in her trouble. </p>
            <p>Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no fitting 
              words came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her bent 
              head as her mother used to do. It was the best thing he could have 
              done, far more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt 
              the unspoken sympathy, and in the silence learned the sweet solace 
              which affection administers to sorrow. Soon she dried the tears 
              which had relieved her, and looked up with a grateful face. </p>
            <p> &quot;Thank you, Teddy, I'm better now. I don't feel so forlorn, 
              and will try to bear it if it comes.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Keep hoping for the best, that will help you, Jo. Soon your 
              mother will be here, and then everything will be all right.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I'm so glad Father is better. Now she won't feel so bad 
              about leaving him. Oh, me! It does seem as if all the troubles came 
              in a heap, and I got the heaviest part on my shoulders,&quot; sighed 
              Jo, spreading her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry. </p>
            <p>&quot;Doesn't Meg pull fair?&quot; asked Laurie, looking indignant. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Oh, yes, she tries to, but she can't love Bethy as I do, 
              and she won't miss her as I shall. Beth is my conscience, and I 
              can't give her up. I can't! I can't!&quot; </p>
            <p>Down went Jo's face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried despairingly, 
              for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a tear. Laurie 
              drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak till he had subdued 
              the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips. It might 
              be unmanly, but he couldn't help it, and I am glad of it. Presently, 
              as Jo's sobs quieted, he said hopefully, &quot;I don't think she 
              will die. She's so good, and we all love her so much, I don't believe 
              God will take her away yet.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;The good and dear people always do die,&quot; groaned Jo, 
              but she stopped crying, for her friend's words cheered her up in 
              spite of her own doubts and fears. </p>
            <p>&quot;Poor girl, you're worn out. It isn't like you to be forlorn. 
              Stop a bit. I'll hearten you up in a jiffy.&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied head 
              down on Beth's little brown hood, which no one had thought of moving 
              from the table where she left it. It must have possessed some magic, 
              for the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into 
              Jo, and when Laurie came running down with a glass of wine, she 
              took it with a smile, and said bravely, &quot;I drink-- Health to 
              my Beth! You are a good doctor, Teddy, and such a comfortable friend. 
              How can I ever pay you?&quot; she added, as the wine refreshed her 
              body, as the kind words had done her troubled mind. </p>
            <p> &quot;I'll send my bill, by-and-by, and tonight I'll give you 
              some- thing that will warm the cockles of your heart better than 
              quarts of wine,&quot; said Laurie, beaming at her with a face of 
              suppressed satisfaction at something. </p>
            <p>&quot;What is it?&quot; cried Jo, forgetting her woes for a minute 
              in her wonder. </p>
            <p>&quot;I telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered 
              she'd come at once, and she'll be here tonight, and everything will 
              be all right. Aren't you glad I did it?&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute, 
              for he had kept his plot a secret, for fear of disappointing the 
              girls or harming Beth. Jo grew quite white, flew out of her chair, 
              and the moment he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing 
              her arms round his neck, and crying out, with a joyful cry, &quot;Oh, 
              Laurie! Oh, Mother! I am so glad!&quot; She did not weep again, 
              but laughed hysterically, and trembled and clung to her friend as 
              if she was a little bewildered by the sudden news. </p>
            <p>Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of 
              mind. He patted her back soothingly, and finding that she was recovering, 
              followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought Jo round 
              at once. Holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away, saying 
              breathlessly, &quot;Oh, don't! I didn't mean to, it was dreadful 
              of me, but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah 
              that I couldn't help flying at you. Tell me all about it, and don't 
              give me wine again, it makes me act so.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't mind,&quot; laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie. 
              &quot;Why, you see I got fidgety, and so did Grandpa. We thought 
              Hannah was overdoing the authority business, and your mother ought 
              to know. She'd never forgive us if Beth... Well, if anything happened, 
              you know. So I got grandpa to say it was high time we did something, 
              and off I pelted to the office yesterday, for the doctor looked 
              sober, and Hannah most took my head off when I proposed a telegram. 
              I never can bear to be `lorded over', so that settled my mind, and 
              I did it. Your mother will come, I know, and the late train is in 
              at two A.M. I shall go for her, and you've only got to bottle up 
              your rapture, and keep Beth quiet till that blessed lady gets here.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Laurie, you're an angel! How shall I ever thank you?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Fly at me again. I rather liked it,&quot; said Laurie, looking 
              mischievous, a thing he had not done for a fortnight. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, thank you. I'll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes. 
              Don't tease, but go home and rest, for you'll be up half the night. 
              Bless you, Teddy, bless you!&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo had backed into a corner, and as she finished her speech,she 
              vanished precipitately into the kitchen, where she sat down upon 
              a dresser and told the assembled cats that she was &quot;happy, 
              oh, so happy!&quot; while Laurie departed, feeling that he had made 
              a rather neat thing of it. </p>
            <p>&quot;That's the interferingest chap I ever see, but I forgive 
              him and do hope Mrs. March is coming right away,&quot; said Hannah, 
              with an air of relief, when Jo told the good news. </p>
            <p>Meg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter, while 
              Jo set the sickroom in order, and Hannah `knocked up a couple of 
              pies in case of company unexpected&quot;. A breath of fresh air 
              seemed to blow through the house, and something better than sunshine 
              brightened the quiet rooms. Everything appeared to feel the hopeful 
              change. Beth's bird began to chirp again, and a half-blown rose 
              was discovered on Amy's bush in the window. The fires seemed to 
              burn with unusual cheeriness, and every time the girls met, their 
              pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged one another, whispering 
              encouragingly, &quot;Mother's coming, dear! Mother's coming!&quot; 
              Every one rejoiced but Beth. She lay in that heavy stupor, alike 
              unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It was a piteous 
              sight, the once rosy face so changed and vacant, the once busy hands 
              so weak and wasted, the once smiling lips quite dumb, and the once 
              pretty, well-kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the pillow. 
              All day she say so, only rousing now and then to mutter, &quot;Water!&quot; 
              with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word. All day Jo 
              and Meg hovered over her, watching, waiting, hoping, and trusting 
              in God and Mother, and all day the snow fell, the bitter wind raged, 
              and the hours dragged slowly by. But night came at last, and every 
              time the clock struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side 
              of the bed, looked at each other with brightening eyes, for each 
              hour brought help nearer. The doctor had been in to say that some 
              change, for better or worse, would probably take place about midnight, 
              at which time he would return. </p>
            <p>Hannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed's foot 
              and fell fast asleep, Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the parlor, 
              feeling that he would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs. March's 
              countenance as she entered. Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to 
              rest, but staring into the fire with the thoughtful look which made 
              his black eyes beautifully soft and clear. </p>
            <p>The girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them as 
              they kept their watch, with that dreadful sense of powerlessness 
              which comes to us in hours like those. </p>
            <p>&quot;If God spares Beth, I never will complain again,&quot; whispered 
              Meg earnestly. </p>
            <p>&quot;If god spares Beth, I'll try to love and serve Him all my 
              life,&quot; answered Jo, with equal fervor. </p>
            <p>&quot;I wish I had no heart, it aches so,&quot; sighed Meg, after 
              a pause. </p>
            <p>&quot;If life is often as hard as this, I don't see how we ever 
              shall get through it,&quot; added her sister despondently. </p>
            <p>Here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in watching 
              Beth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face. The house 
              was still as death, and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke 
              the deep hush. Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters 
              saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed. An 
              hour went by, and nothing happened except Laurie's quiet departure 
              for the station. Another hour, still no one came, and anxious fears 
              of delay in the storm, or accidents by the way, or, worst of all, 
              a great grief at Washington, haunted the girls. </p>
            <p>It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how 
              dreary the world looked in its winding sheet of snow, heard a movement 
              by the bed, and turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling before their mother's 
              easy chair with her face hidden. A dreadful fear passed coldly over 
              Jo, as she thought, &quot;Beth is dead, and Meg is afraid to tell 
              me.&quot; </p>
            <p>She was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited eyes 
              a great change seemed to have taken place. The fever flush and the 
              look of pain were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale 
              and peaceful in its utter repose that Jo felt no desire to weep 
              or to lament. Leaning low over this dearest of her sisters, she 
              kissed the damp forehead with her heart on her lips, and softly 
              whispered, &quot;Goodby, my Beth. Goodby!&quot; </p>
            <p>As if awaked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep, hurried 
              to the bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at her lips, 
              and then, throwing her apron over her head, sat down to rock to 
              and fro, exclaiming, under her breath, &quot;The fever's turned, 
              she's sleepin' nat'ral, her skin's damp, and she breathes easy. 
              Praise be given! Oh, my goodness me!&quot; </p>
            <p>Before the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor came 
              to confirm it. He was a homely man, but they thought his face quite 
              heavenly when he smiled and said, with a fatherly look at them, 
              &quot;Yes, my dears, I think the little girl will pull through this 
              time. Keep the house quiet, let her sleep, and when she wakes, give 
              her...&quot; </p>
            <p>What they were to give, neither heard, for both crept into the 
              dark hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close, rejoicing 
              with hearts too full for words. When they went back to be kissed 
              and cuddled by faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying, as she used 
              to do, with her cheek pillowed on her hand, the dreadful pallor 
              gone, and breathing quietly, as if just fallen asleep. </p>
            <p>&quot;If Mother would only come now!&quot; said Jo, as the winter 
              night began to wane. </p>
            <p>&quot;See,&quot; said Meg, coming up with a white, half-opened 
              rose, </p>
            <p>&quot;I thought this would hardly be ready to lay in Beth's hand 
              tomorrow if she--went away from us. But it has blossomed in the 
              night, and now I mean to put it in my vase here, so that when the 
              darling wakes, the first thing she sees will be the little rose, 
              and Mother's face.&quot; </p>
            <p>Never had the sun risen so beautifully, and never had the world 
              seemed so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo, as they 
              looked out in the early morning, when their long, sad vigil was 
              done. </p>
            <p>&quot;It looks like a fairy world,&quot; said Meg, smiling to herself, 
              as she stood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight. </p>
            <p>&quot;Hark!&quot; cried Jo, starting to her feet. </p>
            <p>Yes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry from Hannah, 
              and then Laurie's voice saying in a joyful whisper, </p>
            <p> &quot;Girls, she's come! She's come!&quot; </p>

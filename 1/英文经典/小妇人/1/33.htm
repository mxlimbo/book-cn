            <p> <br>
              New York, November </p>
            <p>Dear Marmee and Beth, </p>
            <p>I'm going to write you a regular volume, for I've got heaps to 
              tell, though I'm not a fine young lady traveling on the continent. 
              When I lost sight of Father's dear old face, I felt a trifle blue, 
              and might have shed a briny drop or two, if an Irish lady with four 
              small children, all crying more or less, hadn't diverted my mind, 
              for I amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat every 
              time they opened their mouths to roar. </p>
            <p>Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I cleared 
              up likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my heart. </p>
            <p>Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once, even in 
              that big house full of strangers. She gave me a funny little sky 
              parlor--all she had, but there is a stove in it, and a nice table 
              in a sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I like. 
              A fine view and a church tower opposite atone for the many stairs, 
              and I took a fancy to my den on the spot. The nursery, where I am 
              to teach and sew, is a pleasant room next Mrs. Kirke's private parlor, 
              and the two little girls are pretty children, rather spoiled, I 
              fancy, but they took to me after telling them The Seven Bad Pigs, 
              and I've no doubt I shall make a model governess. </p>
            <p>I am to have my meals with the children, if I prefer it to the 
              great table, and for the present I do, for I am bashful, though 
              no one will believe it. </p>
            <p>&quot;Now, my dear, make yourself at home,&quot; said Mrs. K. in 
              her motherly way, &quot;I'm on the drive from morning to night, 
              as you may suppose with such a family, but a great anxiety will 
              be off my mind if I know the children are safe with you. My rooms 
              are always open to you, and your own shall be as comfortable as 
              I can make it. There are some pleasant people in the house if you 
              feel sociable, and your evenings are always free. Come to me if 
              anything goes wrong, and be as happy as you can. There's the tea 
              bell, I must run and change my cap.&quot; And off she bustled, leaving 
              me to settle myself in my new nest. </p>
            <p>As I went downstairs soon after, I saw something I liked. The flights 
              are very long in this tall house, and as I stood waiting at the 
              head of the third one for a little servant girl to lumber up, I 
              saw a gentleman come along behind her, take theheavy hod of coal 
              out of her hand, carry it all the way up, put it down at a door 
              near by, and walk away, saying, with a kind nod and a foreign accent, 
              &quot;It goes better so. The little back is too young to haf such 
              heaviness.&quot; </p>
            <p>Wasn't it good of him? I like such things, for as Father says, 
              trifles show character. When I mentioned it to Mrs. K., that evening, 
              she laughed, and said, &quot;That must have been Professor Bhaer, 
              he's always doing things of that sort.&quot; </p>
            <p>Mrs. K. told me he was from Berlin, very learned and good, but 
              poor as a church mouse, and gives lessons to support himself and 
              two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here, according to 
              the wishes of his sister, who married an American. Not a very romantic 
              story, but it interested me, and I was glad to hear that Mrs. K. 
              lends him her parlor for some of his scholars. There is a glass 
              door between it and the nursery, and I mean to peep at him, and 
              then I'll tell you how he looks. He's almost forty, so it's no harm, 
              Marmee. </p>
            <p>After tea and a go-to-bed romp with the little girls, I attacked 
              the big workbasket, and had a quiet evening chatting with my new 
              friend. I shall keep a journal-letter, and send it once a week, 
              so goodnight, and more tomorrow. </p>
            <p><br>
              Tuesday Eve <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Had a lively time in my seminary this morning, for the children 
              acted like Sancho, and at one time I really thought I should shake 
              them all round. Some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics, and 
              I kept it up till they were glad to sit down and keep still. After 
              luncheon, the girl took them out for a walk, and I went to my needlework 
              like little Mabel `with a willing mind'. I was thanking my stars 
              that I'd learned to make nice buttonholes, when the parlor door 
              opened and shut, and someone began to hum, Kennst Du Das Land, like 
              a big bumblebee. It was dreadfully improper, I know, but I couldn't 
              resist the temptation, and lifting one end of the curtain before 
              the glass door, I peeped in. Professor Bhaer was there, and while 
              he arranged his books, I took a good look at him. A regular German--rather 
              stout, with brown hair tumbled all over his head, a bushy beard, 
              good nose, the kindest eyes I ever saw, and a splendid big voice 
              that does one's ears good, after our sharp or slipshod American 
              gabble. His clothes were rusty, his hands were large, and he hadn't 
              a really handsome feature in his face, except his beautiful teeth, 
              yet I liked him, for he had a fine head, his linen was very nice, 
              and he looked like a gentleman, though two buttons were off his 
              coat and there was a patch on one shoe. He looked sober in spite 
              of his humming, till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth 
              bulbs toward the sun, and stroke the cat, who received him like 
              an old friend. Then he smiled, and when a tap came at the door, 
              called out in a loud, brisk tone, &quot;Herein!&quot; </p>
            <p>I was just going to run, when I caught sight of a morsel of a child 
              carrying a big book, and stopped, to see what was going on. </p>
            <p>&quot;Me wants me Bhaer,&quot; said the mite, slamming down her 
              book and running to meet him. </p>
            <p>&quot;Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer. Come, then, and take a goot hug 
              from him, my Tina,&quot; said the Professor, catching her up with 
              a laugh, and holding her so high over his head that she had to stoop 
              her little face to kiss him. </p>
            <p>&quot;Now me mus tuddy my lessin,&quot; went on the funny little 
              thing. So he put her up at the table, opened the great dictionary 
              she had brought, and gave her a paper and pencil, and she scribbled 
              away, turning a leaf now and then, and passing her little fat finger 
              down the page, as if finding a word, so soberly that I nearly betrayed 
              myself by a laugh, while Mr. Bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair 
              with a fatherly look that made me think she must be his own, though 
              she looked more French than German. </p>
            <p>Another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back 
              to my work, and there I virtuously remained through all the noise 
              and gabbling that went on next door. One of the girls kept laughing 
              affectedly, and saying, &quot;Now Professor,&quot; in a coquettish 
              tone, and the other pronounced her German with an accent that must 
              have made it hard for him to keep sober. </p>
            <p>Both seemed to try his patience sorely, for more than once I heard 
              him say emphatically, &quot;No, no, it is not so, you haf not attend 
              to what I say,&quot; and once there was a loud rap, as if he struck 
              the table with his book, followed by the despairing exclamation, 
              &quot;Prut! It all goes bad this day.&quot; </p>
            <p>Poor man, I pitied him, and when the girls were gone, took just 
              one more peep to see if he survived it. He seemed to have thrown 
              himself back in his chair, tired out, and sat there with his eyes 
              shut till the clock struck two, when he jumped up, put his books 
              in his pocket, as if ready for another lesson, and taking little 
              Tina who had fallen asleep on the sofa in his arms, he carried her 
              quietly away. I fancy he has a hard life of it. Mrs. Kirke asked 
              me if I wouldn't go down to the five o'clock dinner, and feeling 
              a little bit homesick, I thought I would, just to see what sort 
              of people are under the same roof with me. So I made myself respectable 
              and tried to slip in behind Mrs. Kirke, but as she is short and 
              I'm tall, my efforts at concealment were rather a failure. She gave 
              me a seat by her, and after my face cooled off, I plucked up courage 
              and looked about me. The long table was full, and every-- one intent 
              on getting their dinner, the gentlemen especially, who seemed to 
              be eating on time, for they bolted in every sense of the word, vanishing 
              as soon as they were done. There was the usual assortment of young 
              men absorbed in themselves, young couples absorbed in each other, 
              married ladies in their babies, and old gentlemen in politics. I 
              don't think I shall care to have much to do with any of them, except 
              one sweetfaced maiden lady, who looks as if she had something in 
              her. </p>
            <p>Cast away at the very bottom of the table was the Professor, shouting 
              answers to the questions of a very inquisitive, deaf old gentleman 
              on one side, and talking philosophy with a Frenchman on the other. 
              If Amy had been here, she'd have turned her back on him forever 
              because, sad to relate, he had a great appetite, and shoveled in 
              his dinner in a manner which would have horrified `her ladyship'. 
              I didn't mind, for I like `to see folks eat with a relish', as Hannah 
              says, and the poor man must have needed a deal of food after teaching 
              idiots all day. </p>
            <p>As I went upstairs after dinner, two of the young men were settling 
              their hats before the hall mirror, and I heard one say low to the 
              other, &quot;Who's the new party?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Governess, or something of that sort.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;What the deuce is she at our table for?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Friend of the old lady's.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Handsome head, but no style.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Not a bit of it. Give us a light and come on.&quot; </p>
            <p>I felt angry at first, and then I didn't care, for a governess 
              is as good as a clerk, and I've got sense, if I haven't style, which 
              is more than some people have, judging from the remarks of the elegant 
              beings who clattered away, smoking like bad chimneys. I hate ordinary 
              people! </p>
            <p><br>
              Thursday </p>
            <p><br>
              Yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching, sewing, and writing 
              in my little room, which is very cozy, with a light and fire. I 
              picked up a few bits of news and was introduced to the Professor. 
              It seems that Tina is the child of the Frenchwoman who does the 
              fine ironing in the laundry here. The little thing has lost her 
              heart to Mr. Bhaer, and follows him about the house like a dog whenever 
              he is at home, which delights him, as he is very fond of children, 
              though a `bacheldore'. Kitty and Minnie Kirk likewise regard him 
              with affection, and tell all sorts of stories about the plays he 
              invents, the presents he brings, and the splendid tales he tells. 
              The younger men quiz him, it seems, call him Old Fritz, Lager Beer, 
              Ursa Major, and make all manner of jokes on his name. But he enjoys 
              it like a boy, Mrs. Kirke says, and takes it so good-naturedly that 
              they all like him in spite of his foreign ways. </p>
            <p>The maiden lady is a Miss Norton, rich, cultivated, and kind. She 
              spoke to me at dinner today (for I went to table again, it's such 
              fun to watch people), and asked me to come and see her at her room. 
              She has fine books and pictures, knows interesting persons, and 
              seems friendly, so I shall make myself agreeable, for I do want 
              to get into good society, only it isn't the same sort that Amy likes. 
            </p>
            <p>I was in our parlor last evening when Mr. Bhaer came in with some 
              newspapers for Mrs. Kirke. She wasn't there, but Minnie, who is 
              a little old woman, introduced me very prettily. &quot;This is Mamma's 
              friend, Miss March.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, and she's jolly and we like her lots,&quot; added Kitty, 
              who is and `enfant terrible'. </p>
            <p>We both bowed, and then we laughed, for the prim introduction and 
              the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast. </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah, yes, I hear these naughty ones go to vex you, Mees Marsch. 
              If so again, call at me and I come,&quot; he said, with a threatening 
              frown that delighted the little wretches. </p>
            <p>I promised I would, and he departed, but it seems as if I was doomed 
              to see a good deal of him, for today as I passed his door on my 
              way out, by accident I knocked against it with my umbrella. It flew 
              open, and there he stood in his dressing gown, with a big blue sock 
              on one hand and a darning needle in the other. He didn't seem at 
              all ashamed of it, for when I explained and hurried on, he waved 
              his hand, sock and all, saying in his loud, cheerful way... </p>
            <p>&quot;You haf a fine day to make your walk. Bon voyage, Mademoiselle.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>I laughed all the way downstairs, but it was a little pathetic, 
              also to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes. The 
              German gentlemen embroider, I know, but darning hose is another 
              thing and not so pretty. </p>
            <p>Nothing has happened to write about, except a call on Miss Norton, 
              who has a room full of pretty things, and who was very charming, 
              for she showed me all her treasures, and asked me if I would sometimes 
              go with her to lectures and concerts, as her escort, if I enjoyed 
              them. She put it as a favor, but I'm sure Mrs. Kirke has told her 
              about us, and she does it out of kindness to me. I'm as proud as 
              Lucifer, but such favors from such people don't burden me, and I 
              accepted gratefully. When I got back to the nursery there was such 
              an uproar in the parlor that I looked in, and there was Mr. Bhaer 
              down on his hands and knees, with Tina on his back, Kitty leading 
              him with a jump rope, and Minnie feeding two small boys with seedcakes, 
              as they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs. </p>
            <p> &quot;We are playing nargerie,&quot; explained Kitty. </p>
            <p>&quot;Dis is mine effalunt!&quot; added Tina, holding on by the 
              Professor's hair. </p>
            <p>&quot;Mamma always allows us to do what we like Saturday afternoon, 
              when Franz and Emil come, doesn't she, Mr. Bhaer?&quot; said Minnie. 
            </p>
            <p>The `effalunt' sat up, looking as much in earnest as any of them, 
              and said soberly to me, &quot;I gif you my wort it is so, if we 
              make too large a noise you shall say Hush! to us, and we go more 
              softly.&quot; </p>
            <p>I promised to do so, but left the door open and enjoyed the fun 
              as much as they did, for a more glorious frolic I never witnessed. 
              They played tag and soldiers, danced and sang, and when it began 
              to grow dark they all piled onto the sofa about the Professor, while 
              he told charming fairy stories of the storks on the chimney tops, 
              and the little `koblods', who ride the snowflakes as they fall. 
              I wish Americans were as simple and natural as Germans, don't you? 
            </p>
            <p>I'm so fond of writing, I should go spinning on forever if motives 
              of economy didn't stop me, for though I've used thin paper and written 
              fine, I tremble to think of the stamps this long letter will need. 
              Pray forward Amy's as soon as you can spare them. My small news 
              will sound very flat after her splendors, but you will like them, 
              I know. Is Teddy studying so hard that he can't find time to write 
              to his friends? Take good care of him for me, Beth, and tell me 
              all about the babies, and give heaps of love to everyone. From your 
              faithful Jo. </p>
            <p>P.S. On reading over my letter, it strikes me as rather Bhaery, 
              but I am always interested in odd people, and I really had nothing 
              else to write about. Bless you! </p>

              DECEMBER </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>My Precious Betsey, </p>
            <p>As this is to be a scribble-scrabble letter, I direct it to you, 
              for it may amuse you, and give you some idea of my goings on, for 
              though quiet, they are rather amusing, for which, oh, be joyful! 
              After what Amy would call Herculaneum efforts, in the way of mental 
              and moral agriculture, my young ideas begin to shoot and my little 
              twigs to bend as I could wish. They are not so interesting tome 
              as Tina and the boys, but I do my duty by them, and they are fond 
              of me. Franz and Emil are jolly little lads, quite after my own 
              heart, for the mixture of German and American spirit in the produces 
              a constant state of effervescence. Saturday afternoons are riotous 
              times, whether spent in the house or out, for on pleasant days they 
              all go to walk, like a seminary, with the Professor and myself to 
              keep order, and then such fun! </p>
            <p>We are very good friends now, and I've begun to take lessons. I 
              really couldn't help it, and it all came about in such a droll way 
              that I must tell you. To begin at the beginning, Mrs. Kirke called 
              to me one day as I passed Mr. Bhaer's room where she was rummaging. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Did you ever see such a den, my dear? Just come and help 
              me put these books to rights, for I've turned everything upside 
              down, trying to discover what he has done with the six new handkerchiefs 
              I gave him not long ago.&quot; </p>
            <p>I went in, and while we worked I looked about me, for it was `a 
              den' to be sure. Books and papers everywhere, a broken meerschaum, 
              and an old flute over the mantlepiece as if done with, a ragged 
              bird without any tail chirped on one window seat, and a box of white 
              mice adorned the other. Half-finished boats and bits of string lay 
              among the manuscripts. Dirty little boots stood drying before the 
              fire, and traces of the dearly beloved boys, for whom he makes a 
              slave of himself, were to be seen all over the room. After a grand 
              rummage three of the missing articles were found, one over the bird 
              cage, one covered with ink, and a third burned brown, having been 
              used as a holder. </p>
            <p>&quot;Such a man!&quot; laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as she put 
              the relics in the rag bay. &quot;I suppose the others are torn up 
              to rig ships, bandage cut fingers, or make kite tails. It's dreadful, 
              but I can't scold him. He's so absent-minded and goodnatured, he 
              lets those boys ride over him roughshod. I agreed to do his washing 
              and mending, but he forgets to give out his things and I forget 
              to look them over, so he comes to a sad pass sometimes.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;Let me mend them,&quot; said I. &quot;I don't mind it, and 
              he needn't know. I'd like to, he's so kind to me about bringing 
              my letters and lending books.&quot; </p>
            <p>So I have got his things in order, and knit heels into two pairs 
              of the socks, for they were boggled out of shape with his queer 
              darns. Nothing was said, and I hoped he wouldn't find it out, but 
              one day last week he caught me at it. Hearing the lessons he gives 
              to others has interested and amused me so much that I took a fancy 
              to lear, for Tina runs in and out, leaving the door open, and I 
              can hear. I had been sitting near this door, finishing off the last 
              sock, and trying to understand what he said to a new scholar, who 
              is as stupid as I am. The girl had gone, and I thought he had also, 
              it was so still, and I was busily gabbling over a verb, and rocking 
              to and fro in a most absurd way, when a little crow made me look 
              up, and there was Mr. Bhaer looking and laughing quietly, while 
              he made signs to Tina not to betray him. </p>
            <p>&quot;So!&quot; he said, as I stopped and stared like a goose, 
              &quot;you peep at me, I peep at you, and this is not bad, but see, 
              I am not pleasanting when I say, haf you a wish for German?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, but you are too busy. I am too stupid to learn,&quot; 
              I blundered out, as red as a peony. </p>
            <p>&quot;Prut! We will make the time, and we fail not to find the 
              sense. At efening I shall gif a little lesson with much gladness, 
              for look you, Mees Marsch, I haf this debt to pay.&quot; And he 
              pointed to my work `Yes, ' they say to one another, these so kind 
              ladies, `he is a stupid old fellow, he will see not what we do, 
              he will never observe that his sock heels go not in holes any more, 
              he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall, and believe 
              that strings make theirselves.' &quot;Ah! But I haf an eye, and 
              I see much. I haf a heart, and I feel thanks for this. Come, a little 
              lesson then and now, or no more good fairy works for me and mine.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Of course I couldn't say anything after that, and as it really 
              is a splendid opportunity, I made the bargain, and we began. I took 
              four lessons, and then I stuck fast in a grammatical bog. The Professor 
              was very patient with me, but it must have been torment to him, 
              and now and then he'd look at me with such an expression of mild 
              despair that it was a toss-up with me whether to laugh or cry. I 
              tried both ways, and when it came to a sniff or utter mortification 
              and woe, he just threw the grammar on to the floor and marched out 
              of the room. I felt myself disgraced and deserted forever, but didn't 
              blame him a particle, and was scrambling my papers together, meaning 
              to rush upstairs and shake myself hard, when in he came, as brisk 
              and beaming as if I'd covered myself in glory. </p>
            <p>&quot;Now we shall try a new way. You and I will read these pleasant 
              little MARCHEN together, and dig no more in that dry book, that 
              goes in the corner for making us trouble.&quot; </p>
            <p>He spoke so kindly, and opened Hans Andersons's fairy tales so 
              invitingly before me, that I was more ashamed than ever, and went 
              at my lesson in a neck-or-nothing style that seemed to amuse him 
              immensely. I forgot my bashfulness, and pegged away (no other word 
              will express it) with all my might, tumbling over long words, pronouncing 
              according to inspiration of the minute, and doing my very best. 
              When I finished reading my first page, and stopped for breath, he 
              clapped his hands and cried out in his hearty way, &quot;Das ist 
              gut!' Now we go well! My turn. I do him in German, gif me your ear.&quot; 
              And away he went, rumbling out the words with his strong voice and 
              a relish which was good to see as well as hear. Fortunately the 
              story was the CONSTANT TIN SOLDIER, which is droll, you know, so 
              I could laugh, and I did, though I didn't understand half he read, 
              for I couldn't help it, he was so earnest, I so excited, and the 
              whole thing so comical. </p>
            <p>After that we got on better, and now I read my lessons pretty well, 
              for this way of studying suits me, and I can see that the grammar 
              gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills in jelly. 
              I like it very much, and he doesn't seem tired of it yet, which 
              is very good of him, isn't it? I mean to give him something on Christmas, 
              for I dare not offer money. Tell me something nice, Marmee. </p>
            <p>I'm glad Laurie seems so happy and busy, that he has given up smoking 
              and lets his hair grow. You see Beth manages him better than I did. 
              I'm not jealous, dear, do your best, only don't make a saint of 
              him. I'm afraid I couldn't like him without a spice of human naughtiness. 
              Read him bits of my letters. I haven't time to write much, and that 
              will do just as well. Thank Heaven Beth continues so comfortable. 
              <br>

            <p>JANUARY <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              A Happy New Year to you all, my dearest family, which of course 
              includes Mr. L. and a young man by the name of Teddy. I can't tell 
              you how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle, for i didn't get it 
              till night and had given up hoping. Your letter came in the morning, 
              but you said nothing about a parcel, meaning it for a surprise, 
              so I was disappointed, for I'd had a `kind of feeling' that you 
              wouldn't forget me. I felt a little low in my mind as I sat up in 
              my room after tea, and when the big, muddy, battered-looking bundle 
              was brought to me, I just hugged it and pranced. It was so homey 
              and refreshing that I sat down on the floor and read and looked 
              and ate and laughed and cried, in my usual absurd way. The things 
              were just what I wanted, and all the better for being made instead 
              of bought. Beth's new `ink bib' was capital, and Hannah's box of 
              hard gingerbread will be a treasure. I'll be sure and wear the nice 
              flannels you sent, Marmee, and read carefully the books Father has 
              marked. Thank you all, heaps and heaps! </p>
            <p>Speaking of books reminds me that I'm getting rich in that line, 
              for on New Year's Day Mr. Bhaer gave me a fine Shakespeare. It is 
              one he values much, and I've often admired it, set up in the place 
              of honor with his German Bible, Plato, Homer, and Milton, so you 
              may imagine how I felt when he brought it down, without its cover, 
              and showed me my own name in it, &quot;from my friend Friedrich 
              Bhaer&quot;. </p>
            <p>&quot;You say often you wish a library. Here I gif you one, for 
              between these lids (he meant covers) is many books in one. Read 
              him well, and he will help you much, for the study of character 
              in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it 
              with your pen.&quot; </p>
            <p>I thanked him as well as I could, and talk now about `my library', 
              as if I had a hundred books. I never knew how much there was in 
              Shakespeare before, but then I never had a Bhaer to explain it to 
              me. Now don't laugh at his horrid name. It isn't pronounced either 
              Bear or Beer, as people will say it, but something between the two, 
              as only Germans can give it. I'm glad you both like what I tell 
              you about him, and hope you will know him some day. Mother would 
              admire his warm heart, Father his wise head. I admire both, and 
              feel rich in my new `friend Friedrich Bhaer'. </p>
            <p>Not having much money, or knowing what he'd like, I got several 
              little things, and put them about the room, where he would find 
              them unexpectedly. They were useful, pretty, or funny, a new standish 
              on his table, a little vase for his flower, he always has one, or 
              a bit of green in a glass, to keep him fresh, he says, and a holder 
              for his blower, so that he needn't burn up what Amy calls `mouchoirs'. 
              I made it like those Beth invented, a big butterfly with a fat body, 
              and black and yellow wings, worsted feelers, and bead eyes. It took 
              his fancy immensely, and he put it on his mantlepiece as an article 
              of virtue, so it was rather a failure after all. Poor as he is, 
              he didn't forget a servant or a child in the house, and not a soul 
              here, from the French laundrywoman to Miss Norton forgot him. I 
              was so glad of that. </p>
            <p>They got up a masquerade, and had a gay time New Year's Eve. I 
              didn't mean to go down, having no dress. But at the last minute, 
              Mrs. Kirke remembered some old brocades, and Miss Norton lent me 
              lace and feathers. So I dressed up as Mrs. Malaprop, and sailed 
              in with a mask on. No one knew me, for I disguised my voice, and 
              no one dreamed of the silent, haughty Miss March (for they think 
              I am very stiff and cool, most of them, and so I am to whippersnappers) 
              could dance and dress, and burst out into a `nice derangement of 
              epitaphs, like an allegory on the banks of the Nile'. I enjoyed 
              it very much, and when we unmasked it was fun to see them stare 
              at me. I heard one of the young men tell another that he knew I'd 
              been an actress, in fact, he thought he remembered seeing me at 
              one of the minor theaters. Meg will relish that joke. Mr. Bhaer 
              was Nick Bottom, and Tina was Titania, a perfect little fairy in 
              his arms. To see them dance was `quite a landscape', to use a Teddyism. 
            </p>
            <p>I had a very happy New Year, after all, and when I thought it over 
              in my room, I felt as if I was getting on a little in spite of my 
              many failures, for I'm cheerful all the time now, work with a will, 
              and take more interest in other people than I used to, which is 
              satisfactory. Bless you all! Ever your loving... Jo </p>

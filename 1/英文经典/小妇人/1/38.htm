              <br>
              In France the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married, 
              when `Vive la liberte!' becomes their motto. In America, as everyone 
              knows, girls early sign the declaration of independence, and enjoy 
              their freedom with republican zest, but the young matrons usually 
              abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion 
              almost as close as a French nunnery, though by no means as quiet. 
              Whether they like it or not, they are virtually put upon the shelf 
              as soon as the wedding excitement is over, and most of them might 
              exclaim, as did a very pretty woman the other day, &quot;I'm as 
              handsome as ever, but no one takes any notice of me because I'm 
              married.&quot; </p>
            <p>Not being a belle or even a fashionable lady, Meg did not experience 
              this affliction till her babies were a year old, for in her little 
              world primitive customs prevailed, and she found herself more admired 
              and beloved than ever. </p>
            <p>As she was a womanly little woman, the maternal instinct was very 
              strong, and she was entirely absorbed in her children, to the utter 
              exclusion of everything and everybody else. Day and night she brooded 
              over them with tireless devotion and anxiety, leaving John to the 
              tender mercies of the help, for an Irish lady now presided over 
              the kitchen department. Being a domestic man, John decidedly missed 
              the wifely attentions he had been accustomed to receive, but as 
              he adored his babies, he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for 
              a time, supposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon 
              be restored. But three months passed, and there was no return of 
              repose. Meg looked worn and nervous, the babies absorbed every minute 
              of her time, the house was neglected, and Kitty, the cook, who took 
              life `aisy', kept him on short commons. When he went out in the 
              morning he was bewildered by small commissions for the captive mamma, 
              if he came gaily in at night, eager to embrace his family, he was 
              quenched by a &quot;Hush! They are just asleep after worrying all 
              day.&quot; If he proposed a little amusement at home, &quot;No, 
              it would disturb the babies.&quot; If he hinted at a lecture or 
              a concert, he was answered with a reproachful look, and a decided 
              &quot;Leave my children for pleasure, never!&quot; His sleep was 
              broken by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly 
              to and fro in the watches of the night. His meals were interrupted 
              by the frequent flight of the presiding genius, who deserted him, 
              half-helped, if a muffled chirp sounded from the nest above. And 
              when he read his paper of an evening, Demi's colic got into the 
              shipping list and Daisy's fall affected the price of stocks, for 
              Mrs. Brooke was only interested in domestic news. </p>
            <p>The poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had bereft 
              him of his wife, home was merely a nursery and the perpetual `hushing' 
              made him feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred 
              precincts of Babyland. He bore it very patiently for six months, 
              and when no signs of amendment appeared, he did what other paternal 
              exiles do--tried to get a little comfort elsewhere. Scott had married 
              and gone to housekeeping not far off, and John fell into the way 
              of running over for an hour or two of an evening, when his own parlor 
              was empty, and his own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have 
              no end. Mrs. Scott was a lively, pretty girl, with nothing to do 
              but be agreeable, and she performed her mission most successfully. 
              The parlor was always bright and attractive, the chessboard ready, 
              the piano in tune, plenty of gay gossip, and a nice little supper 
              set forth in tempting style. </p>
            <p>John would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so 
              lonely, but as it was he gratefully took the next best thing and 
              enjoyed his neighbor's society.</p>
            <p>Meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first, and found 
              it a relief to know that John was having a good time instead of 
              dozing in the parlor, or tramping about the house and waking the 
              children. But by-and-by, when the teething worry was over and the 
              idols went to sleep at proper hours, leaving Mamma time to rest, 
              she began to miss John, and find her workbasket dull company, when 
              he was not sitting opposite in his old dressing gown, comfortably 
              scorching his slippers on the fender. She would not ask him to stay 
              at home, but felt injured because he did not know that she wanted 
              him without being told, entirely forgetting the many evenings he 
              had waited for her in vain. She was nervous and worn out with watching 
              and worry, and in that unreasonable frame of mind which the best 
              of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares oppress them. 
              Want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness, and too much devotion 
              to that idol of American women, the teapot, makes them feel as if 
              they were all nerve and no muscle.</p>
            <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she would say, looking in the glass, &quot;I'm 
              getting old and ugly. John doesn't find me interesting any longer, 
              so he leaves his faded wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor, 
              who has no incumbrances. Well, the babies love me, they don't care 
              if I am thin and pale and haven't time to crimp my hair, they are 
              my comfort, and some day John will see what I've gladly sacrificed 
              for them, won't he, my precious?&quot; </p>
            <p>To which pathetic appeal daisy would answer with a coo, or Demi 
              with a crow, and Meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal 
              revel, which soothed her solitude for the time being. But the pain 
              increased as politics absorbed John, who was always running over 
              to discuss interesting points with Scott, quite unconscious that 
              Meg missed him. Not a word did she say, however, till her mother 
              found her in tears one day, and insisted on knowing what the matter 
              was, for Meg's drooping spirits had not escaped her observation. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I wouldn't tell anyone except you, Mother, but I really do 
              need advice, for if John goes on much longer I might as well be 
              widowed,&quot; replied Mrs. Brooke, drying her tears on Daisy's 
              bib with an injured air. </p>
            <p>&quot;Goes on how, my dear?&quot; asked her mother anxiously. </p>
            <p>&quot;He's away all day, and at night when I want to see him, he 
              is continually going over to the Scotts'. It isn't fair that I should 
              have the hardest work, and never any amusement. Men are very selfish, 
              even the best of them.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;So are women. Don't blame John till you see where you are 
              wrong yourself.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;But it can't be right for him to neglect me.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't you neglect him?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, Mother, I thought you'd take my part!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;So I do, as far as sympathizing goes, but I think the fault 
              is yours, Meg.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't see how.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Let me show you. Did John ever neglect you, as you call it, 
              while you made it a point to give him your society of an evening, 
              his only leisure time?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, but I can't do it now, with two babies to tend.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I think you could, dear, and I think you ought. May I speak 
              quite freely, and will you remember that it's Mother who blames 
              as well as Mother who sympathizes?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Indeed I will! Speak to me as if I were little Meg again. 
              I often feel as if I needed teaching more than ever since these 
              babies look to me for everything.&quot; </p>
            <p>Meg drew her low chair beside her mother's, and with a little interruption 
              in either lap, the two women rocked and talked lovingly together, 
              feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than ever. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You have only made the mistake that most young wives make-forgotten 
              your duty to your husband in your love for your children. A very 
              natural and forgivable mistake, Meg, but one that had better be 
              remedied before you take to different ways, for children should 
              draw you nearer than ever, not separate you, as if they were all 
              yours, and John had nothing to do but support them. I've seen it 
              for some weeks, but have not spoken, feeling sure it would come 
              right in time.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm afraid it won't. If I ask him to stay, he'll think I'm 
              jealous, and I wouldn't insult him by such an idea. He doesn't see 
              that I want him, and I don't know how to tell him without words.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Make it so pleasant he won't want to go away. My dear, he's 
              longing for his little home, but it isn't home without you, and 
              you are always in the nursery.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oughtn't I to be there?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Not all the time, too much confinement makes you nervous, 
              and then you are unfitted for everything. Besides, you owe something 
              to John as well as to the babies. Don't neglect husband for children, 
              don't shut him out of the nursery, but teach him how to help in 
              it. His place is there as well as yours, and the children need him. 
              Let him feel that he has a part to do, and he will do it gladly 
              and faithfully, and it will be better for you all.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You really think so, Mother?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I know it, Meg, for I've tried it, and I seldom give advice 
              unless I've proved its practicability. When you and Jo were little, 
              I went on just as you are, feeling as if I didn't do my duty unless 
              I devoted myself wholly to you. Poor Father took to his books, after 
              I had refused all offers of help, and left me to try my experiment 
              alone. I struggled along as well as I could, but Jo was too much 
              for me. I nearly spoiled her by indulgence. You were poorly, and 
              I worried about you till I fell sick myself. Then Father came to 
              the rescue, quietly managed everything, and made himself so helpful 
              that I saw my mistake, and never have been able to got on without 
              him since. That is the secret of our home happiness. He does not 
              let business wean him from the little cares and duties that affect 
              us all, and I try not to let domestic worries destroy my interest 
              in his pursuits. Each do our part alone in many things, but at home 
              we work together, always.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;It is so, Mother, and my great wish is to be to my husband 
              and children what you have been to yours. Show me how, I'll do anything 
              you say.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You were always my docile daughter. Well, dear, if I were 
              you, I'd let John have more to do with the management of Demi, for 
              the boy needs training, and it's none too soon to begin. Then I'd 
              do what I have often proposed, let Hannah come and help you. She 
              is a capital nurse, and you may trust the precious babies to her 
              while you do more housework. You need the exercise, Hannah would 
              enjoy the rest, and John would find his wife again. Go out more, 
              keep cheerful as well as busy, for you are the sunshine-maker of 
              the family, and if you get dismal there is no fair weather. Then 
              I'd try to take an interest in whatever John likes--talk with him, 
              let him read to you, exchange ideas, and help each other in that 
              way. Don't shut yourself up in a bandbox because you are a woman, 
              but understand what is going on, and educate yourself to take your 
              part in the world's work, for it all affects you and yours.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;John is so sensible, I'm afraid he will think I'm stupid 
              if I ask questions about politics and things.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't believe he would. Love covers a multitude of sins, 
              and of whom could you ask more freely than of him? Try it, and see 
              if he doesn't find your society far more agreeable than Mrs. Scott's 
              suppers.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I will. Poor John! I'm afraid I have neglected him sadly, 
              but I thought I was right, and he never said anything.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;He tried not to be selfish, but he has felt rather forlorn, 
              I fancy. This is just the time, Meg, when young married people are 
              apt to grow apart, and the very time when they ought to be most 
              together, for the first tenderness soon wears off, unless care is 
              taken to preserve it. And no time is so beautiful and precious to 
              parents as the first years of the little lives given to them to 
              train. Don't let John be a stranger to the babies, for they will 
              do more to keep him safe and happy in this world of trial and temptation 
              than anything else, and through them you will learn to know and 
              love one another as you should. Now, dear, good-by. Think over Mother's 
              preachment, act upon it if it seems good, and God bless you all.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Meg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it, though 
              the first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it. 
              Of course the children tyrannized over her, and ruled the house 
              as soon as they found out that kicking and squalling brought them 
              whatever they wanted. Mamma was an abject slave to their caprices, 
              but Papa was not so easily subjugated, and occasionally afflicted 
              his tender spouse by an attempt at paternal discipline with his 
              obstreperous son. For Demi inherited a trifle of his sire's firmness 
              of character, we won't call it obstinacy, and when he made up his 
              little to have or to do anything, all the king's horses and all 
              the king's men could not change that pertinacious little mind. Mamma 
              thought the dear too young to be taught to conquer his prejudices, 
              but Papa believed that it never was too soon to learn obedience. 
              So Master Demi early discovered that when he undertook to `wrastle' 
              with `Parpar', he always got the worst of it, yet like the Englishman, 
              baby respected the man who conquered him, and loved the father whose 
              grave &quot;No, no,&quot; was more impressive than all Mamma's love 
              pats. A few days after the talk with her mother, Meg resolved to 
              try a social evening with John, so she ordered a nice supper, set 
              the parlor in order, dressed herself prettily, and put the children 
              to bed early, that nothing should interfere with her experiment. 
              But unfortunately Demi's most unconquerable prejudice was against 
              going to bed, and that night he decided to go on a rampage. So poor 
              Meg sang and rocked, told stories and tried every sleep-prevoking 
              wile she could devise, but all in vain, the big eyes wouldn't shut, 
              and long after Daisy had gone to byelow, like the chubby little 
              bunch of good nature she was, naughty Demi lay staring at the light, 
              with the most discouragingly wide-awake expression of countenance. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Will Demi lie still like a good boy, while Mamma runs down 
              and gives poor Papa his tea?&quot; asked Meg, as the hall door softly 
              closed, and the well-known step went tip-toeing into the dining 
              room. </p>
            <p>&quot;Me has tea!&quot; said Demi, preparing to join in the revel. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;No, but I'll save you some little cakies for breakfast, 
              if you'll go bye-by like Daisy. Will you, lovey?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Iss!&quot; and Demi shut his eyes tight, as if to catch sleep 
              and hurry the desired day. </p>
            <p>Taking advantage of the propitious moment, Meg slipped away and 
              ran down to greet her husband with a smiling face and the little 
              blue bow in her hair which was his especial admiration. He saw it 
              at once and said with pleased surprise, &quot;Why, little mother, 
              how gay we are tonight. Do you expect company?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Only you, dear.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I'm tired of being dowdy, so I dressed up as a change. 
              You always make yourself nice for table, no matter how tired you 
              are, so why shouldn't I when I have the time?' </p>
            <p>&quot;I do it out of respect for you, my dear,&quot; said old-fashioned 
              John. </p>
            <p>&quot;Ditto, ditto, Mr. Brooke,&quot; laughed Meg, looking young 
              and pretty again, as she nodded to him over the teapot.</p>
            <p>&quot;Well, it's altogether delightful, and like old times. This 
              tastes right. I drink your health, dear.&quot; And John sipped his 
              tea with an air of reposeful rapture, which was of very short duration 
              however, for as he put down his cup, the door handle rattled mysteriously, 
              and a little voice was heard, saying impatiently ... </p>
            <p>&quot;Opy doy. Me's tummin!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;It's that naughty boy. I told him to go to sleep alone, and 
              here he is, downstairs, getting his death a-cold pattering over 
              that canvas,&quot; said Meg, answering the call. </p>
            <p>&quot;Mornin' now,&quot; announced Demi in joyful tone as he entered, 
              with his long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every 
              curl bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table, eyeing the `cakies' 
              with loving glances. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, it isn't morning yet. You must go to bed, and not trouble 
              poor Mamma. Then you can have the little cake with sugar on it.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Me loves Parpar,&quot; said the artful one, preparing to 
              climb the paternal knee and revel in forbidden joys. But John shook 
              his head, and said to Meg... </p>
            <p>&quot;If you told him to stay up there, and go to sleep alone, 
              make him do it, or he will never learn to mind you.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, of course. Come, Demi.&quot; And Meg led her son away, 
              feeling a strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside 
              her, laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered 
              as soon as they reached the nursery. </p>
            <p>Nor was he disappointed, for that shortsighted woman actually gave 
              him a lump of sugar, tucked him into his bed, and forbade any more 
              promenades till morning. </p>
            <p>&quot;Iss!&quot; said Demi the perjured, blissfully sucking his 
              sugar, and regarding his first attempt as eminently successful. 
            </p>
            <p>Meg returned to her place, and supper was progressing pleasantly, 
              when the little ghost walked again and exposed the maternal delinquencies 
              by boldly demanding, &quot;More sudar, Marmar.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Now this won't do,&quot; said John, hardening his heart against 
              the engaging little sinner. &quot;We shall never know any peace 
              till that child learns togo to bed properly. You have made a slave 
              of yourself long enough. Give him one lesson, and then there will 
              be an end of it. Put him in his bed and leave him, Meg.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;He won't stay there, he never does unless I sit by him.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I'll manage him. Demi, go upstairs, and get into your bed, 
              as Mamma bids you.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;S'ant!&quot; replied the young rebel, helping himself to 
              the coveted `cakie', and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;You must never say that to Papa. I shall carry you if you 
              don't go yourself.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Go 'way, me don't love Parpar.&quot; And Demi retired to 
              his mother's skirts for protection. </p>
            <p>But even that refuge proved unavailing, for he was delivered over 
              to the enemy, with a &quot;Be gentle with him, John,&quot; which 
              struck the culprit with dismay, for when Mamma deserted him, then 
              the judgment day was at hand. Bereft of his cake, defrauded of his 
              frolic, and borne away by a strong hand to that detested bed, poor 
              Demi could not restrain his wrath, but openly defied Papa, and kicked 
              and screamed lustily all the way upstairs. The minute he was put 
              into bed on one side, he rolled out on the other, and made for the 
              door, only to be ignominiously caught up by the tail of his little 
              toga and put back again, which lively performance was kept up till 
              the young man's strength gave out, when he devoted himself to roaring 
              at the top of his voice. This vocal exercise usually conquered Meg, 
              but John sat as unmoved as the post which is popularly believed 
              to be deaf. No coaxing, no sugar, no lullaby, no story, even the 
              light was put out and only the red glow of the fire enlivened the 
              `big dark' which Demi regarded with curiosity rather than fear. 
              This new order of things disgusted him, and he howled dismally for 
              `Marmar', as his angry passions subsided, and recollections of his 
              tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat. The plaintive 
              wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to Meg's heart, and 
              she ran up to say beseechingly... </p>
            <p>&quot;Let me stay with him, he'll be good now, John.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, my dear. I've told him he must go to sleep, as you bid 
              him, and he must, if I stay here all night.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;But he'll cry himself sick,&quot; pleaded Meg, reproaching 
              herself for deserting her boy. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, he won't, he's so tired he will soon drop off and then 
              the matter is settled, for he will understand that he has got to 
              mind. Don't interfere, I'll manage him.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;He's my child, and I can't have his spirit broken by harshness.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;He's my child, and I won't have his temper spoiled by indulgence. 
              Go down, my dear, and leave the boy to me.&quot; </p>
            <p>When John spoke in that masterful tone, Meg always obeyed, and 
              never regretted her docility. </p>
            <p>&quot;Please let me kiss him once, John?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Certainly. Demi, say good night to Mamma, and let her go 
              and rest, for she is very tired with taking care of you all day.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory, for 
              after it was given, Demi sobbed more quietly, and lay quite still 
              at the bottom of the bed, whither he had wriggled in his anguish 
              of mind. </p>
            <p>&quot;Poor little man, he's worn out with sleep and crying. I'll 
              cover him up, and then go and set Meg's heart at rest.&quot; thought 
              John, creeping to the bedside, hoping to find his rebellious heir 
              asleep. </p>
            <p>But he wasn't, for the moment his father peeped at him, Demi's 
              eyes opened, his little chin began to quiver, and he put up his 
              arms, saying with a penitent hiccough, &quot;Me's dood, now.&quot;</p>
            <p> Sitting on the stairs outside Meg wondered at the long silence 
              which followed the uproar, and after imagining all sorts of impossible 
              accidents, she slipped into the room to set her fears at rest. Demi 
              lay fast asleep, not in his usual spreadeagle attitude, but in a 
              subdued bunch, cuddled close in the circle of his father's arm and 
              holding his father's finger, as if he felt that justice was tempered 
              with mercy, and had gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby. So held, 
              John had waited with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed 
              its hold, and while waiting had fallen asleep, more tired by that 
              tussle with his son than with his whole day's work. </p>
            <p>As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she smiled to 
              herself, and then slipped away again, saying in a satisfied tone, 
              &quot;I never need fear that John will be too harsh with my babies. 
              He does know how to manage them, and will be a great help, for Demi 
              is getting too much for me.&quot; </p>
            <p>When John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive or reproachful 
              wife, he was agreeably surprised to find Meg placidly trimming a 
              bonnet, and to be greeted with the request to read something about 
              the election, if he was not too tired. John saw in a minute that 
              a revolution of some kind was going on, but wisely asked no questions, 
              knowing that Meg was such a transparent little person, she couldn't 
              keep a secret to save her life, and therefore the clue would soon 
              appear. He read a long debate with the most amiable readiness and 
              then explained it in his most lucid manner, while Meg tried to look 
              deeply interested, to ask intelligent questions, and keep her thoughts 
              from wandering from the state of the nation to the state of her 
              bonnet. In her secret soul, however, she decided that politics were 
              as bad as mathematics, and the the mission of politicians seemed 
              to be calling each other names, but she kept these feminine ideas 
              to herself, and when John paused, shook her head and said with what 
              she thought diplomatic ambiguity, &quot;Well, I really don't see 
              what we are coming to.&quot; </p>
            <p>John laughed, and watched her for a minute, as she poised a pretty 
              little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand, and regarded 
              it with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;She is trying to like politics for my sake, so I'll try and 
              like millinery for hers, that's only fair,&quot; thought John the 
              Just, adding aloud, &quot;That's very pretty. Is it what you call 
              a breakfast cap?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;My dear man, it's a bonnet! My very best go-to-concert-and-theater 
              bonnet.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I beg your pardon, it was so small, I naturally mistook it 
              for one of the flyaway things you sometimes wear. How do you keep 
              it on?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud, 
              so.&quot; And Meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding 
              him with an air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's a love of a bonnet, but I prefer the face inside, for 
              it looks young and happy again.&quot; And John kissed the smiling 
              face, to the great detriment of the rosebud under the chin. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm glad you like it, for I want you to take me to one of 
              the new concerts some night. I really need some music to put me 
              in tune. Will you, please?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Of course I will, with all my heart, or anywhere else you 
              like. You have been shut up so long, it will do you no end of good, 
              and I shall enjoy it, of all things. What put it into your head, 
              little mother?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I had a talk with Marmee the other day, and told her 
              how nervous and cross and out of sorts I felt, and she said I needed 
              change and less care, so Hannah is to help me with the children, 
              and I'm to see to things about the house more, and now and then 
              have a little fun, just to keep me from getting to be a fidgety, 
              broken-down old woman before my time. It's only an experiment, John, 
              and I want to try it for your sake as much as for mine, because 
              I've neglected you shamefully lately, and I'm going to make home 
              what it used to be, if I can. You don't object, I hope?&quot; </p>
            <p>Never mind what John said, or what a very narrow escape the little 
              bonnet had from utter ruin. All that we have any business to know 
              is that John did not appear to object, judging from the changes 
              which gradually took place in the house and its inmates. It was 
              not all Paradise by any means, but everyone was better for the division 
              of labor system. The children throve under the paternal rule, for 
              accurate, stedfast John brought order and obedience into Babydom, 
              while Meg recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty 
              of wholesome exercise, a little pleasure, and much confidential 
              conversation with her sensible husband. Home grew homelike again, 
              and John had no wish to leave it, unless he took Meg with him. The 
              Scotts came to the Brookes' now, and everyone found the little house 
              a cheerful place, full of happiness, content, and family love. Even 
              Sallie Moffatt liked to go there. &quot;It is always so quiet and 
              pleasant here, it does me good, Meg,&quot; she used to say, looking 
              about her with wistful eyes, as if trying to discover the charm, 
              that she might use it in her great house, full of splendid lonliness, 
              for there were no riotous, sunny-faced babies there, and Ned lived 
              in a world of lis own, where there was no place for her. </p>
            <p>This household happiness did not come all at once, but John and 
              Meg had found the key to it, and each year of Married life taught 
              them how to use it, unlocking the treasuries of real home love and 
              mutual helpfulness, which the poorest may possess, and the richest 
              cannot buy. This is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers 
              may consent to be laid, safe from the restless fret and fever of 
              the world, finding loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters 
              who cling to them, undaunted by sorrow, poverty, or age, walking 
              side by side, through fair and stormy weather, with a faithful friend, 
              who is, in the true sense of the good old Saxon word, the `house-band', 
              and learning, as Meg learned, that a woman's happiest kingdom is 
              home, her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen, but 
              as a wise wife and mother. </p>

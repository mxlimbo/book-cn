              Jo's face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed upon 
              her, and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important. 
              Meg observed it, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, 
              for she had learned that the best way to manage Jo was by the law 
              of contraries, so she felt sure of being told everything if she 
              did not ask. She was rather surprised, therefore, when the silence 
              remained unbroken, and Jo assumed a patronizing air, which decidedly 
              aggravated Meg, who in turn assumed an air of dignified reserve 
              and devoted herself to her mother. This left Jo to her own devices, 
              for Mrs. March had taken her place as nurse, and bade her rest, 
              exercise, and amuse herself after her long confinement. Amy being 
              gone, Laurie was her only refuge, and much as she enjoyed his society, 
              she rather dreaded him just then, for he was an incorrigible tease, 
              and she feared he would coax the secret from her. </p>
            <p>She was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner suspected 
              a mystery than he set himself to find it out, and led Jo a trying 
              life of it. He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, and scolded; 
              affected indifference, that he might surprise the truth from her; 
              declared her knew, then that he didn't care; and at last, by dint 
              of perseverance, he satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and 
              Mr. Brooke. Feeling indignant that he was not taken into his tutor's 
              confidence, he set his wits to work to devise some proper retaliation 
              for the slight. </p>
            <p>Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed 
              in preparations for her father's return, but all of a sudden a change 
              seemed to come over her, and, for a day or two, she was quite unlike 
              herself. She started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was 
              very quiet, and sat over her sewing, with a timid, troubled look 
              on her face. To her mother's inquiries she answered that she was 
              quite well, and Jo's she silenced by begging to be let alone. </p>
            <p>&quot;She feels it in the air--love, I mean--and she's going very 
              fast. She's got most of the symptoms--is twittery and cross, doesn't 
              eat, lies awake, and mopes in corners. I caught her singing that 
              song he gave her, and once she said `John', as you do, and then 
              turned as red as a poppy. whatever shall we do?&quot; said Jo, looking 
              ready for any measures, however violent. </p>
            <p>&quot;Nothing but wait. Let her alone, be kind and patient, and 
              Father's coming will settle everything,&quot; replied her mother. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Here's a note to you, Meg, all sealed up. How odd! Teddy 
              never seals mine,&quot; said Jo next day, as she distributed the 
              contents of the little post office. </p>
            <p>Mrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a sound 
              from Meg made them look up to see her staring at her note with a 
              frightened face. </p>
            <p>&quot;My child, what is it?&quot; cried her mother, running to 
              her, while Jo tried to take the paper which had done the mischief. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It's all a mistake, he didn't send it. Oh, Jo, how could 
              you do it?&quot; and Meg hid her face in her hands, crying as if 
              her heart were quite broken. </p>
            <p>&quot;Me! I've done nothing! What's she talking about?&quot; cried 
              Jo, bewildered. </p>
            <p>Meg's mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note 
              from her pocket and threw it at Jo, saying reproachfully, &quot;You 
              wrote it, and that bad boy helped you. How could you be so rude, 
              so mean, and cruel to us both?&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo hardly heard her, for she and her mother were reading the note, 
              which was written in a peculiar hand. </p>
            <p><br>
              &quot;My Dearest Margaret, </p>
            <p>&quot;I can no longer restrain my passion, and must know my fate 
              before I return. I dare not tell your parents yet, but I think they 
              would consent if they knew that we adored one another. Mr. Laurence 
              will help me to some good place, and then, my sweet girl, you will 
              make me happy. I implore you to say nothing to your family yet, 
              but to send one word of hope through Laurie to, </p>
            <p> &quot;Your devoted John.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, the little villain! That's the way he meant to pay me 
              for keeping my word to Mother. I'll give him a hearty scolding and 
              bring him over to beg pardon,&quot; cried Jo, burning to execute 
              immediate justice. But her mother held her back, saying, with a 
              look she seldom wore... </p>
            <p>&quot;Stop, Jo, you must clear yourself first. You have played 
              so many pranks that I am afraid you have had a hand in this.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;On my word, Mother, I haven't! I never saw that note before, 
              and don't know anything about it, as true as I live!&quot; said 
              Jo, so earnestly that they believed her. &quot;If I had taken part 
              in it I'd have done it better than this, and have written a sensible 
              note. I should think you'd have known Mr. Brooke wouldn't write 
              such stuff as that,&quot; she added, scornfully tossing down the 
              paper. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's like his writing,&quot; faltered Meg, comparing it with 
              the note in her hand. &quot;Oh, Meg, you didn't answer it?&quot; 
              cried Mrs. March quickly. </p>
            <p> &quot;Yes, I did!&quot; and Meg hid her face again, overcome with 
              shame. </p>
            <p>&quot;Here's a scrape! Do let me bring that wicked boy over to 
              explain and be lectured. I can't rest till I get hold of him.&quot; 
              And Jo made for the door again. </p>
            <p>&quot;Hush! Let me handle this, for it is worse than I thought. 
              Margaret, tell me the whole story,&quot; commanded Mrs. March, sitting 
              down by Meg, yet keeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off. </p>
            <p>&quot;I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn't look 
              as if he knew anything about it,&quot; began Meg, without looking 
              up. &quot;I was worried at first and meant to tell you, then I remembered 
              how you liked Mr. Brooke, so I thought you wouldn't mind if I kept 
              my little secret for a few days. I'm so silly that I liked to think 
              no one knew, and while I was deciding what to say, I felt like the 
              girls in books, who have such things to do. Forgive me, Mother, 
              I'm paid for my silliness now. I never can look him in the face 
              again.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;What did you say to him?' asked Mrs. March. </p>
            <p>&quot;I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet, 
              that I didn't wish to have secrets from you, and he must speak to 
              father. I was very grateful for his kindness, and would be his friend, 
              but nothing more, for a long while.&quot; </p>
            <p>Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her hands, 
              exclaiming, with a laugh, &quot;You are almost equal to Caroline 
              Percy, who was a pattern of prudence! Tell on, Meg. What did he 
              say to that?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;He writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he 
              never sent any love letter at all, and is very sorry that my roguish 
              sister, Jo, should take liberties with our names. It's very kind 
              and respectful, but think how dreadful for me!&quot; </p>
            <p>Meg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair, and 
              Jo tramped about the room, calling Laurie names. All of a sudden 
              she stopped, caught up the two notes, and after looking at them 
              closely, said decidedly, &quot;I don't believe Brooke ever saw either 
              of these letters. Teddy wrote both, and keeps yours to crow over 
              me with because I wouldn't tell him my secret.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;Don't have any secrets, Jo. Tell it to Mother and keep out 
              of trouble, as I should have done,&quot; said Meg warningly. </p>
            <p> &quot;Bless you, child! Mother told me.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;That will do, Jo. I'll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie. 
              I shall sift the matter to the bottom, and put a stop to such pranks 
              at once.&quot; Away ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke's 
              real feelings. &quot;Now, dear, what are your own? Do you love him 
              enough to wait till her can make a home for you, or will you keep 
              yourself quite free for the present?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I've been so scared and worried, I don't want to have anything 
              to do with lovers for a long while, perhaps never,&quot; </p>
            <p>answered Meg petulantly. &quot;If John doesn't know anything about 
              this nonsense, don't tell him, and make Jo and Laurie hold their 
              tongues. I won't be deceived and plagued and made a fool of. It's 
              a shame!&quot; </p>
            <p>Seeing Meg's usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt 
              by this mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her by promises of 
              entire silence and great discretion for the future. The instant 
              Laurie's step was heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and 
              Mrs. March received the culprit alone. Jo had not told him why he 
              was wanted, fearing he wouldn't come, but he knew the minute he 
              saw Mrs. March's face, and stood twirling his hat with a guilty 
              air which convicted him at once. Jo was dismissed, but chose to 
              march up and down the hall like a sentinel, having some fear that 
              the prisoner might bolt. The sound of voices in the parlor rose 
              and fell for half an hour, but what happened during that interview 
              the girls never knew </p>
            <p>When they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother with 
              such a penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot, but did not 
              think it wise to betray the fact. Meg received his humble apology, 
              and was much comforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing 
              of the joke. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll never tell him to my dying day, wild horses shan't drag 
              it out of me, so you'll forgive me, Meg, and I'll do anything to 
              show how out-and-out sorry I am,&quot; he added, looking very much 
              ashamed of himself. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do, I 
              didn't think you could be so sly and malicious, Laurie,&quot; replied 
              Meg, trying to hid her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful 
              air. </p>
            <p>&quot;It was altogether abominable, and I don't deserve to be spoken 
              to for a month, but you will, though, won't you?&quot; And Laurie 
              folded his hands together with such and imploring gesture, as he 
              spoke in his irresistibly persuasive tone, that it was impossible 
              to frown upon him in spite of his scandalous behavior. </p>
            <p>Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March's grave face relaxed, in spite 
              of her efforts to keep sober, when she heard him declare that he 
              would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances, and abase himself 
              like a worm before the injured damsel. </p>
            <p>Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against him, 
              and succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression of 
              entire disapprobation. Laurie looked at her once or twice, but as 
              she showed no sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his 
              back on her till the others were done with him, when he made her 
              a low bow and walked off without a word. </p>
            <p>As soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving, 
              and when Meg and her mother went upstairs, she felt lonely and longed 
              for Teddy. After resisting for some time, she yielded to the impulse, 
              and armed with a book to return, went over to the big house. </p>
            <p>&quot;Is Mr. Laurence in?&quot; asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was 
              coming downstairs. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, Miss, but I don't believe he's seeable just yet.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Why not? Is he ill?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;La, no Miss, but he's had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is 
              in one of his tantrums about something, which vexes the old gentleman, 
              so I dursn't go nigh him.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Where is Laurie?' </p>
            <p>&quot;Shut up in his room, and he won't answer, though I've been 
              a-tapping. I don't know what's to become of the dinner, for it's 
              ready, and there's no one to eat it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll go and see what the matter is. I'm not afraid of either 
              of them.&quot; </p>
            <p>Up went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie's little 
              study. </p>
            <p>&quot;Stop that, or I'll open the door and make you!&quot; called 
              out the young gentleman in a threatening tone. </p>
            <p>Jo immediately knocked again. The door flew open, and in she bounced 
              before Laurie could recover from his surprise. Seeing that he really 
              was out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him, assumed a contrite 
              expression, and going artistically down upon her knees, said meekly, 
              &quot;Please forgive me for being so cross. I came to make it up, 
              and can't go away till I have.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;It's all right. Get up, and don't be a goose, Jo,&quot; was 
              the cavalier reply to her petition. </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you, I will. Could I ask what's the matter? You don't 
              look exactly easy in your mind.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I've been shaken, and I won't bear it!&quot; growled Laurie 
              indignantly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Who did it?&quot; demanded Jo. </p>
            <p>&quot;Grandfather. If it had been anyone else I'd have...&quot;</p>
            <p>And the injured youth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture 
              of the right arm. </p>
            <p>&quot;That's nothing. I often shake you, and you don't mind,&quot; 
              said Jo soothingly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Pooh! You're a girl, and it's fun, but I'll allow no man 
              to shake me!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't think anyone would care to try it, if you looked 
              as much like a thundercloud as you do now. Why were you treated 
              so?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Just because I wouldn't say what your mother wanted me for. 
              I'd promised not to tell, and of course I wasn't going to break 
              my word.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Couldn't you satisfy your grandpa in any other way?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;No, he would have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
              but the truth. I'd have told my part of the scrape, if I could without 
              bringing Meg in. As I couldn't, I held my tongue, and bore the scolding 
              till the old gentleman collared me. Then I bolted, for fear I should 
              forget myself.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;It wasn't nice, but he's sorry, I know, so go down and make 
              up. I'll help you.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Hanged if I do! I'm not going to be lectured and pummelled 
              by everyone, just for a bit of a frolic. I was sorry about Meg, 
              and begged pardon like a man, but I won't do it again, when I wasn't 
              in the wrong.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;He didn't know that.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;He ought to trust me, and not act as if I was a baby. It's 
              no use, Jo, he's got to learn that I'm able to take care of myself, 
              and don't need anyone's apron string to hold on by.&quot; &quot;What 
              pepper pots you are! &quot; sighed Jo. &quot;How do you mean to 
              settle this affair?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, he ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I 
              can't tell him what the fuss's about.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Bless you! He won't do that.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I won't go down till he does.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Now, Teddy, be sensible. Let it pass, and I'll explain what 
              I can. You can't stay here, so what's the use of being melodramatic?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't intend to stay here long, anyway. I'll slip off and 
              take a journey somewhere, and when Grandpa misses me he'll come 
              round fast enough.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;I dare say, but you ought not to go and worry him.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Don't preach. I'll go to Washington and see Brooke. It's 
              gay there, and I'll enjoy myself after the troubles.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;What fun you'd have! I wish I could run off too,&quot; said 
              Jo, forgetting her part of mentor in lively visions of martial life 
              at the capital. </p>
            <p>&quot;Come on, then! Why not? You go and surprise your father, 
              and I'll stir up old Brooke. It would be a glorious joke. Let's 
              do it, Jo. We'll leave a letter saying we are all right, and trot 
              off at once. I've got money enough. It will do you good, and no 
              harm, as you go to your father.&quot;</p>
            <p>For a moment Jo looked as if she would agree, for wild as the plan 
              was, it just suited her. She was tired of care and confinement, 
              longed for change, and thoughts of her father blended temptingly 
              with the novel charms of camps and hospitals, liberty and fun. Her 
              eyes kindled as they turned wistfully toward the window, but they 
              fell on the old house opposite, and she shook her head with sorrowful 
              decision.</p>
            <p>&quot;If I was a boy, we'd run away together, and have a capital 
              time, but as I'm a miserable girl, I must be proper and stop at 
              home. Don't tempt me, Teddy, it's a crazy plan.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That's the fun of it,&quot; began Laurie, who had got a willful 
              fit on him and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Hold your tongue!&quot; cried Jo, covering her ears. &quot;`Prunes 
              and prisms' are my doom, and I may as well make up my mind to it. 
              I came here to moralize, not to hear things that make me skip to 
              think of.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I thought 
              you had more spirit,&quot; began Laurie insinuatingly. </p>
            <p> &quot;Bad boy, be quiet! Sit down and think of your own sins, 
              don't go making me add to mine. If I get your grandpa to apologize 
              for the shaking, will you give up running away?&quot; asked Jo seriously.</p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, but you won't do it,&quot; answered Laurie, who wished 
              to make up, but felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased 
              first. </p>
            <p>&quot;If I can manage the young one, I can the old one,&quot; muttered 
              Jo, as she walked away, leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map 
              with his head propped up on both hands. </p>
            <p>&quot;Come in!&quot; And Mr. Laurence's gruff voice sounded gruffer 
              than ever, as Jo tapped at his door.</p>
            <p>&quot;It's only me, Sir, come to return a book,&quot; she said 
              blandly, as she entered. </p>
            <p>&quot;Want any more?&quot; asked the old gentleman, looking grim 
              and vexed, but trying not to show it.</p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, please. I like old Sam so well, I think I'll try the 
              second volume,&quot; returned Jo, hoping to propitiate him by accepting 
              a second dose of Boswell's Johnson, as he had recommended that lively 
              work. </p>
            <p>The shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps toward 
              the shelf where the Johnsonian literature was placed. Jo skipped 
              up, and sitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her 
              book, but was really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous 
              object of her visit. Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect that something 
              was brewing in her mind, for after taking several brisk turns about 
              the room, he faced round on her, speaking so abruptly that Rasselas 
              tumbled face downward on the floor. </p>
            <p>&quot;What has that boy been about? Don't try to shield him. I 
              know he has been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home. 
              I can't get a word from him, and when I threatened to shake the 
              truth out of him he bolted upstairs and locked himself into his 
              room.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;He did wrong, but we forgave him, and all promised not to 
              say a word to anyone,&quot; began Jo reluctantly. </p>
            <p>&quot;That won't do. He shall not shelter himself behind a promise 
              from you softhearted girls. If he's done anything amiss, he shall 
              confess, beg pardon, and be punished. Out with it, Jo. I won't be 
              kept in the dark.&quot; </p>
            <p>Mr. Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo would 
              have gladly run away, if she could, but she was perched aloft on 
              the steps, and he stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she 
              had to stay and brave it out. </p>
            <p>&quot;Indeed, Sir, I cannot tell. Mother forbade it. Laurie has 
              confessed, asked pardon, and been punished quite enough. We don't 
              keep silence to shield him, but someone else, and it will make more 
              trouble if you interfere. Please don't. It was partly my fault, 
              but it's all right now. So let's forget it, and talk about the RAMBLER 
              or something pleasant.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Hang the RAMBLER! Come down and give me your word that this 
              harum-scarum boy of mine hasn't done anything ungrateful or impertinent. 
              If he has, after all your kindness to him, I'll thrash him with 
              my own hands.&quot; </p>
            <p>The threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew the 
              irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson, 
              whatever he might say to the contrary. She obediently descended, 
              and made as light of the prank as she could without betraying Meg 
              or forgetting the truth. </p>
            <p>&quot;Hum... ha... well, if the boy held his tongue because he 
              promised, and not from obstinacy, I'll forgive him. He's a stubborn 
              fellow and hard to manage,&quot; said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his 
              hair till it looked as if he had been out in a gale, and smoothing 
              the frown from his brow with an air of relief. </p>
            <p>&quot;So am I, but a kind word will govern me when all the king's 
              horses and all the king's men couldn't,&quot; said Jo, trying to 
              say a kind word for her friend, who seemed to get out of one scrape 
              only to fall into another. </p>
            <p>&quot;You think I'm not kind to him, hey?&quot; was the sharp answer. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Oh, dear no, Sir. You are rather too kind sometimes, and 
              then just a trifle hasty when he tries your patience. Don't you 
              think you are?&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite placid, 
              though she quaked a little after her bold speech. </p>
            <p>To her great relief and surprise, the old gentleman only threw 
              his spectacles onto the table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly, 
              &quot;You're right, girl, I am! I love the boy, but he tries my 
              patience past bearing, and I know how it will end, if we go on so.&quot;</p>
            <p> &quot;I'll tell you, he'll run away.&quot; Jo was sorry for that 
              speech the minute it was made. She meant to warn him that Laurie 
              would not bear much restraint, and hoped he would be more forebearing 
              with the lad. </p>
            <p>Mr. Laurence's ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down, with 
              a troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which hung over 
              his table. It was Laurie's father, who had run away in his youth, 
              and married against the imperious old man's will. Jo fancied her 
              remembered and regretted the past, and she wished she had held her 
              tongue. </p>
            <p>&quot;He won't do it unless he is very much worried, and only threatens 
              it sometimes, when he gets tired of studying. I often think I should 
              like to, especially since my hair was cut, so if you ever miss us, 
              you may advertise for two boys and look among the ships bound for 
              India.&quot; </p>
            <p>She laughed as she spoke, and Mr. Laurence looked relieved, evidently 
              taking the whole as a joke. </p>
            <p>&quot;You hussy, how dare you talk in that way? Where's your respect 
              for me, and your proper bringing up? Bless the boys and girls! What 
              torments they are, yet we can't do without them,&quot; he said, 
              pinching her cheeks good-humoredly. &quot;Go and bring that boy 
              down to his dinner, tell him it's all right, and advise him not 
              to put on tragedy airs with his grandfather. I won't bear it.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;He won't come, Sir. He feels badly because you didn't believe 
              him when he said he couldn't tell. I think the shaking hurt his 
              feelings very much.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed, for Mr. Laurence 
              began to laugh, and she knew the day was won.</p>
            <p>&quot;I'm sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking 
              me, I suppose. What the dickens does the fellow expect?&quot; And 
              the old gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.</p>
            <p> &quot;If I were you, I'd write him an apology, Sir. He says he 
              won't come down till he has one, and talks about Washington, and 
              goes on in an absurd way. A formal apology will make him see how 
              foolish he is, and bring him down quite amiable. Try it. He likes 
              fun, and this was is better than talking. I'll carry it up, and 
              teach him his duty.&quot; </p>
            <p>Mr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles, 
              saying slowly, &quot;You're a sly puss, but I don't mind being managed 
              by you and Beth. Here, give me a bit of paper, and let us have done 
              with this nonsense.&quot; </p>
            <p>The note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use 
              to another after offering some deep insult. Jo dropped a kiss on 
              the top of Mr. Laurence's bald head, and ran up to slip the apology 
              under Laurie's door, advising him through the keyhole to be submissive, 
              decorous, and a few other agreeable impossibilities. Finding the 
              door locked again, she left the note to do its work, and was going 
              quietly away, when the young gentleman slid down the banisters, 
              and waited for her at the bottom, saying, with his most virtuous 
              expression of countenance, &quot;What a good fellow you are, Jo! 
              Did you get blown up?&quot; he added, laughing. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, he was pretty mild, on the whole.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;AH! I got it all round. Even you cast me off over there, 
              and I felt just ready to go to the deuce,&quot; he began apologetically. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Don't talk that way, turn over a new leaf and begin again, 
              Teddy, my son.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I used 
              to spoil my copybooks, and I make so many beginnings there never 
              will be an end,&quot; he said dolefully. </p>
            <p>&quot;Go and eat your dinner, you'll feel better after it. Men 
              always croak when they are hungry,&quot; and Jo whisked out at the 
              front door after that. </p>
            <p>&quot;That's a `label' on my `sect',&quot; answered Laurie, quoting 
              Amy, as he went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his grandfather, 
              who was quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in 
              manner all the rest of the day. </p>
            <p>Everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over, 
              but the mischief was done, for though others forgot it, Meg remembered. 
              She never alluded to a certain person, but she thought of him a 
              good deal, dreamed dreams more than ever, and once Jo, rummaging 
              her sister's desk for stamps, found a bit of paper scribbled over 
              with the words, `Mrs. John Brooke', whereat she groaned tragically 
              and cast it into the fire, feeling that Laurie's prank had hastened 
              the evil day for her. </p>

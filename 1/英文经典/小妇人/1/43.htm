              <br>
              Jo was alone in the twilight, lying on the old sofa, looking at 
              the fire, and thinking. It was her favorite way of spending the 
              hour of dusk. No one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on 
              Beth's little red pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or 
              thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away. 
              Her face looked tired, grave, and rather sad, for tomorrow was her 
              birthday, and she was thinking how fast the years went by, how old 
              she was getting, and how little she seemed to have accomplished. 
              Almost twenty-five, and nothing to show for it. Jo was mistaken 
              in that. There was a good deal to show, and by-and-by she saw, and 
              was grateful for it. </p>
            <p>&quot;An old maid, that's what I'm to be. A literary spinster, 
              with a pen for a spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty 
              years hence a morsel of fame, perhaps, when, like poor Johnson, 
              I'm old and can't enjoy it, solitary, and can't share it, independent, 
              and don't need it. Well, I needn't be a sour saint nor a selfish 
              sinner, and, I dare say, old maids are very comfortable when they 
              get used to it, but...&quot; And there Jo sighed, as if the prospect 
              was not inviting. </p>
            <p>It seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things 
              to five-and-twenty. But it's not as bad as it looks, and one can 
              get on quite happily if one has something in one's self to fall 
              back upon. At twenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old maids, 
              but secretly resolve that they never will be. At thirty they say 
              nothing about it, but quietly accept the fact, and if sensible, 
              console themselves by remembering that they have twenty more useful, 
              happy years, in which they may be learning to grow old gracefully. 
              Don't laugh at the spinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, 
              tragic romances are hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly 
              under the sober gowns, and many silent sacrifices of youth, health, 
              ambition, love itself, make the faded faces beautiful in God's sight. 
              Even the sad, sour sisters should be kindly dealt with, because 
              they have missed the sweetest part of life, if for no other reason. 
              And looking at them with compassion, not contempt, girls in their 
              bloom should remember that they too may miss the blossom time. That 
              rosy cheeks don't last forever, that silver threads will come in 
              the bonnie brown hair, and that, by-and-by, kindness and respect 
              will be as sweet as love and admiration now.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no 
              matter how poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth 
              having is that which is the readiest to pay deference to the old, 
              protect the feeble, and serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, 
              or color. Just recollect the good aunts who have not only lectured 
              and fussed, but nursed and petted, too often without thanks, the 
              scrapes they have helped you out of, the tips they have given you 
              from their small store, the stitches the patient old fingers have 
              set for you, the steps the willing old feet have taken, and gratefully 
              pay the dear old ladies the little attentions that women love to 
              receive as long as they live. The bright-eyed girls are quick to 
              see such traits, and will like you all the better for them, and 
              if death, almost the only power that can part mother and son, should 
              rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a tender welcome and 
              maternal cherishing from some Aunt Priscilla, who has kept the warmest 
              corner of her lonely old heart for `the best nevvy in the world'. 
            </p>
            <p>Jo must have fallen asleep (as I dare say my reader has during 
              this little homily), for suddenly Laurie's ghost seemed to stand 
              before her, a substantial, lifelike ghost, leaning over her with 
              the very look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and didn't 
              like to show it. But, like Jenny in the ballad... <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>She could not think it he, <br>
              and lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped <br>
              and kissed her. Then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully 
              . .. </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh my Teddy! Oh my Teddy!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Glad! My blessed boy, words can't express my gladness. Where's 
              Amy?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Your mother has got her down at Meg's. We stopped there by 
              the way, and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Your what?&quot; cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two 
              words with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed 
              him. </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, the dickens! Now I've done it.&quot; And he looked so 
              guilty that Jo was down on him like a flash. </p>
            <p>&quot;You've gone and got married!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, please, but I never will again.&quot; And he went down 
              upon his knees, with a penitent clasping of hands, and a face full 
              of mischief, mirth, and triumph. </p>
            <p>&quot;Actually married?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Very much so, thank you.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Mercy on us. What dreadful thing will you do next?&quot; 
              And Jo fell into her seat with a gasp. </p>
            <p>&quot;A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,&quot; 
              returned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming with satisfaction. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;What can you expect, when you take one's breath away, creeping 
              in like a burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that? Get up, 
              you ridiculous boy, and tell me all about it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Not a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and promise 
              not to barricade.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day, and 
              patted the sofa invitingly, as she said in a cordial tone, &quot;The 
              old pillow is up garret, and we don't need it now. So, come and 
              fess, Teddy.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;How good it sounds to hear you say `Teddy'! No one ever calls 
              me that but you.&quot; And Laurie sat down with an air of great 
              content. </p>
            <p>&quot;What does Amy call you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;My lord.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That's like her. Well, you look it.&quot; And Jo's eye plainly 
              betrayed that she found her boy comelier than ever. </p>
            <p>The pillow was gone, but there was a barricade, nevertheless, a 
              natural one, raised by time absence, and change of heart. Both felt 
              it, and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible 
              barrier cast a little shadow over them. It was gone directly however, 
              for Laurie said, with a vain attempt at dignity... </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't I look like a married man and the head of a family?&quot; 
              &quot;Not a bit, and you never will. You've grown bigger and bonnier, 
              but you are the same scapegrace as ever.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Now really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect,&quot; 
              began Laurie, who enjoyed it all immensely. </p>
            <p>&quot;How can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled, 
              is so irresistibly funny that I can't keep sober!&quot; answered 
              Jo, smiling all over her face, so infectiously that they had another 
              laugh, and then settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant 
              old fashion. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for they 
              are all coming up presently. I couldn't wait. I wanted to be the 
              one to tell you the grand surprise, and have `first skim' as we 
              used to say when we squabbled about the cream.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Of course you did, and spoiled your story by beginning at 
              the wrong end. Now, start right, and tell me how it all happened. 
              I'm pining to know.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I did it to please Amy,&quot; began Laurie, with a 
              twinkle that made Jo exclaim... </p>
            <p>&quot;Fib number one. Amy did it to please you. Go on, and tell 
              the truth, if you can, sir.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Now she's beginning to marm it. Isn't it jolly to hear her?&quot; 
              said Laurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if 
              it quite agreed. &quot;It's all the same, you know, she and I being 
              one. We planned to come home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, 
              but they suddenly changed their minds, and decided to pass another 
              winter in Paris. But Grandpa wanted to come home. He went to please 
              me, and I couldn't let him go along, neither could I leave Amy, 
              and Mrs. Carrol had got English notions about chaperons and such 
              nonsense, and wouldn't let Amy come with us. So I just settled the 
              difficulty by saying, `Let's be married, and then we can do as we 
              like'.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Of course you did. You always have things to suit you.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Not always.&quot; And something in Laurie's voice made Jo 
              say hastily... </p>
            <p>&quot;How did you ever get Aunt to agree?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;It was hard work, but between us, we talked her over, for 
              we had heaps of good reasons on our side. There wasn't time to write 
              and ask leave, but you all liked it, had consented to it by-and-by, 
              and it was only `taking time by the fetlock', as my wife says.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Aren't we proud of those two word, and don't we like to 
              say them?&quot; interrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, 
              and watching with delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in 
              the eyes that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last. 
              &quot;A trifle, perhaps, she's such a captivating little woman I 
              can't help being proud of her. Well, then Uncle and Aunt were there 
              to play propriety. We were so absorbed in one another we were of 
              no mortal use apart, and that charming arrangement woul make everything 
              easy all round, so we did it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;When, where, how?&quot; asked Jo, in a fever of feminine 
              interest and curiosity, for she could not realize it a particle. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Six weeks ago, at the American consul's, in Paris, a very 
              quiet wedding of course, for even in our happiness we didn't forget 
              dear little Beth.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo put her hand in his as he said that, and Laurie gently smoothed 
              the little red pillow, which he remembered well. </p>
            <p>&quot;Why didn't you let us know afterward?&quot; asked Jo, in 
              a quieter tone, when they had sat quite still a minute. </p>
            <p>&quot;We wanted to surprise you. We thought we were coming directly 
              home, at first, but the dear old gentleman, as soon as we were married, 
              found he couldn't be ready under a month, at least, and sent us 
              off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked. Amy had once called 
              Valrosa a regular honeymoon home, so we went there, and were as 
              happy as people are but once in their lives. My faith! Wasn't it 
              love among the roses!&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of it, 
              for the fact that he told her these things so freely and so naturally 
              assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten. She tried 
              to draw away her hand, but as if he guessed the thought that prompted 
              the half-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast, and said, with 
              a manly gravity she had never seen in him before... </p>
            <p>&quot;Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we'll put it 
              by forever. As I told you in my letter when I wrote that Amy had 
              been so kind to me, I never shall stop loving you, but the love 
              is altered, and I have learned to see that it is better as it is. 
              Amy and you changed places in my heart, that's all. I think it was 
              meant to be so, and would have come about naturally, if I had waited, 
              as you tried to make me, but I never could be patient, and so I 
              got a heartache. I was a boy then, headstrong and violent, and it 
              took a hard lesson to show me my mistake. For it was one, Jo, as 
              you said, and I found it out, after making a fool of myself. Upon 
              my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind, at one time, that I didn't 
              know which I loved best, you or Amy, and tried to love you both 
              alike. But I couldn't, and when I saw her in Switzerland, everything 
              seemed to clear up all at once. You both got into your right places, 
              and I felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it 
              was on with the new, that I could honestly share my heart between 
              sister Jo and wife Amy, and love them dearly. Will you believe it, 
              and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one another?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I'll believe it, with all my heart, but, Teddy, we never 
              can be boy and girl again. The happy old times can't come back, 
              and we mustn't expect it. We are man and woman now, with sober work 
              to do, for playtime is over, and we must give up frolicking. I'm 
              sure you feel this. I see the change in you, and you'll find it 
              in me. I shall miss my boy, but I shall love the man as much, and 
              admire him more, because he means to be what I hoped he would. We 
              can't be little playmates any longer, but we will be brother and 
              sister, to love and help one another all our lives, won't we, Laurie?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>He did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and laid 
              his face down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the grave 
              of a boyish passion, there had risen a beautiful, strong friendship 
              to bless them both. Presently Jo said cheerfully, for she didn't 
              the coming home to be a sad one, &quot;I can't make it true that 
              you children are really married and going to set up housekeeping. 
              Why, it seems only yesterday that I was buttoning Amy's pinafore, 
              and pulling your hair when you teased. Mercy me, how time does fly!&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn't 
              talk so like a grandma. I flatter myself I'm a `gentleman growed' 
              as Peggotty said of David, and when you see Amy, you'll find her 
              rather a precocious infant,&quot; said Laurie, looking amused at 
              her maternal air. </p>
            <p>&quot;You may be a little older in years, but I'm ever so much 
              older in feeling, Teddy. Women always are, and this last year has 
              been such a hard one that I feel forty.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Poor Jo! We left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring. 
              You are older. Here's a line, and there's another. Unless you smile, 
              your eyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now, I 
              found a tear on it. You've had a great deal to bear, and had to 
              bear it all alone. What a selfish beast I've been!&quot; And Laurie 
              pulled his own hair, with a remorseful look. </p>
            <p>But Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered, in 
              a tone which she tried to make more cheerful, &quot;No, I had Father 
              and Mother to help me, and the dear babies to comfort me, and the 
              thought that you and Amy were safe and happy, to make the troubles 
              here easier to bear. I am lonely, sometimes, but I dare say it's 
              good for me, and...&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You never shall be again,&quot; broke in Laurie, putting 
              his arm about her, as if to fence out every human ill. &quot;Amy 
              and I can't get on without you, so you must come and teach `the 
              children' to keep house, and go halves in everything, just as we 
              used to do, and let us pet you, and all be blissfully happy and 
              friendly together.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;If I shouldn't be in the way, it would be very pleasant. 
              I begin to feel quite young already, for somehow all my troubles 
              seemed to fly away when you came. You always were a comfort, Teddy.&quot; 
              And Jo leaned her head on his shoulder, just as she did years ago, 
              when Beth lay ill and Laurie told her to hold on to him. </p>
            <p>He looked down at her, wondering if she remembered the time, but 
              Jo was smiling to herself, as if in truth her troubles had all vanished 
              at his coming. </p>
            <p>&quot;You are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one minute, 
              and laughing the next. You look a little wicked now. What is it, 
              Grandma?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I was wondering how you and Amy get on together.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Like angels!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, of course, but which rules?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't mind telling you that she does now, at least I let 
              her think so, it pleases her, you know. By-and-by we shall take 
              turns, for marriage, they say, halves one's rights and doubles one's 
              duties.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You'll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the 
              days of your life.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, she does it so imperceptibly that I don't think I shall 
              mind much. She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well. 
              In fact, I rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as 
              softly and prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if 
              she was doing you a favor all the while.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and 
              enjoying it!&quot; cried Jo, with uplifted hands. </p>
            <p>It was good to see Laurie square his shoulders, and smile with 
              masculine scorn at that insinuation, as he replied, with his &quot;high 
              and mighty&quot; air, &quot;Amy is too well-bred for that, and I 
              am not the sort of man to submit to it. My wife and I respect ourselves 
              and one another too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo like that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but the 
              boy seemed changing very fast into the man, and regret mingled with 
              her pleasure. </p>
            <p>&quot;I am sure of that. Amy and you never did quarrel as we used 
              to. She is the sun and I the wind, in the fable, and the sun managed 
              the man best, you remember.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;She can blow him up as well as shine on him,&quot; laughed 
              Laurie. &quot;such a lecture as I got at Nice! I give you my word 
              it was a deal worse than any or your scoldings, a regular rouser. 
              I'll tell you all about it sometime, she never will, because after 
              telling me that she despised and was ashamed of me, she lost her 
              heart to the despicable party and married the good-for-nothing.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;What baseness! Well, if she abuses you, come to me, and 
              I'll defend you.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I look as if I needed it, don't I?&quot; said Laurie, getting 
              up and striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing 
              to the rapturous, as Amy's voice was heard calling, &quot;Where 
              is she? Where's my dear old Jo?&quot; </p>
            <p>In trooped the whole family, and everyone was hugged and kissed 
              all over again, and after several vain attempts, the three wanderers 
              were set down to be looked at and exulted over. Mr. Laurence, hale 
              and hearty as ever, was quite as much improved as the others by 
              his foreign tour, for the crustiness seemed to be early gone, and 
              the old-fashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it 
              kindlier than ever. It was good to see him beam at `my children', 
              as he called the young pair. It was better still to see Amy pay 
              him the daughterly duty and affection which completely won his old 
              heart, and best of all, to watch Laurie revolve about the two, as 
              if never tired of enjoying the pretty picture they made. </p>
            <p>The minute she put her eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that 
              her own dress hadn't a Parisian air, that young Mrs. Mofffat would 
              be entirely eclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that `her ladyship' 
              was altogether a most elegant and graceful woman. Jo thought, as 
              she watched the pair, &quot;How well they look together! I was right, 
              and Laurie has found the beautiful, accomplished girl who will become 
              his home better than clumsy old Jo, and be a pride, not a torment 
              tohim.&quot; Mrs. March and her husband smiled and nodded at each 
              other with happy faces, for they saw that their youngest had done 
              well, not only in worldly things, but the better wealth of love, 
              confidence, and happiness. </p>
            <p>For Amy's face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a 
              peaceful heart, her voice had a new tenderness in it, and the cool, 
              prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and 
              winning. No little affectations marred it, and the cordial sweetness 
              of her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace, 
              for it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true 
              gentlewoman she had hoped to become. </p>
            <p>&quot;Love has done much for our little girl,&quot; said her mother 
              softly. </p>
            <p>&quot;She has had a good example before her all her life, my dear,&quot; 
              Mr. March whispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and 
              gray head beside him. </p>
            <p>Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her `pitty aunty', 
              but attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine 
              full of delightful charms. Demi paused to consider the new relationship 
              before he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, 
              which took the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne. 
              A flank movement produced an unconditional surrender, however, for 
              Laurie knew where to have him. </p>
            <p>&quot;Young man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance 
              you hit me in the face. Now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman,&quot; 
              and with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small 
              nephew in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as 
              it delighted his boyish soul. </p>
            <p>&quot;Blest if she ain't in silk from head to foot? Ain't it a 
              relishin' sight to see her settin' there as fine as a fiddle, anch 
              a happy procession as filed away into the little dining room! Mr. 
              March proudly escorted Mrs. Laurence. Mrs. March as proudly leaned 
              on the arm of `my son'. The old gentleman took Jo, with a whispered, 
              &quot;You must be my girl now,&quot; and a glance at the empty corner 
              by thefire, that made Jo whisper back, &quot;I'll try to fill her 
              place, sir. </p>
            <p>The twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at hand, 
              for everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were left 
              to revel at their own sweet will, and you may be sure they made 
              the most of the opportunity. Didn't they steal sips of tea, stuff 
              gingerbread ad libitum, get a hot biscuit apiece, and as a crowning 
              trespass, didn't they each whisk a captivating little tart into 
              their tiny pockets, there to stick and crumble treacherously, teaching 
              them that both human nature and a pastry are frail? Burdened with 
              the guilty consciousness of the sequestered tarts, and fearing that 
              Dodo's sharp eyes would pierce the thin disguise of cambric and 
              merino which hid their booty, the little sinners attached themselves 
              to `Dranpa', who hadn't his spectacles on. Amy, who was handed about 
              like refreshments, returned to the parlor on Father Laurence's arm. 
              The others paired off as before, and this arrangement left Jo companionless. 
              She did not mind it at the minute, for she lingered to answer Hannah's 
              eager inquiry. </p>
            <p>&quot;Will Miss Amy ride in her coop (coupe), and use all them 
              lovely silver dishes that's stored away over yander?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Shouldn't wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold 
              plate, and wore diamonds and point lace every day. Teddy thinks 
              nothing too good for her,&quot; returned Jo with infinite satisfaction. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;No more there is! Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?&quot; 
              asked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose. </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't care.&quot; And Jo shut the door, feeling that food 
              was an uncongenial topic just then. She stood a minute looking at 
              the party vanishing above, and as Demi's short plaid legs toiled 
              up the last stair, a sudden sense of lonliness came over her so 
              strongly that she looked about her with dim eyes, as if to find 
              something to lean upon, for even Teddy had deserted her. If she 
              had known what birthday gift was coming every minute nearer and 
              nearer, she would not have said to herself, &quot;I'll weep a little 
              weep when I go to bed. It won't do to be dismal now.&quot; Then 
              she drew her hand over her eyes, for one of her boyish habits was 
              never to know where her handkerchief was, and had just managed to 
              call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch door. </p>
            <p>She opened with hospitable haste, and started as if another ghost 
              had come to surprise her, for there stood a tall bearded gentleman, 
              beaming on her from the darkness like a midnight sun. </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you!&quot; cried Jo, with 
              a clutch, as if she feared the night would swallow him up before 
              she could get him in. </p>
            <p>&quot;And I to see Miss Marsch, but no, you haf a party,&quot; 
              and the Professor paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing 
              feet came down to them. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, we haven't, only the family. My sister and friends have 
              just come home, and we are all very happy. Come in, and make one 
              of us.&quot; </p>
            <p>Though a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously 
              away, and come again another day, but how could he, when Jo shut 
              the door behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps her face 
              had something to do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing 
              him, and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to 
              the solitary man, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see 
              them all. You haf been ill, my friend?&quot; </p>
            <p>He put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat, the 
              light fell on her face, and he saw a change in it. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not ill, but tired and sorrowful. We have had trouble since 
              I saw you last.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah, yes, I know. My heart was sore for you when I heard that,&quot; 
              And he shook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt 
              as if no comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp 
              of the big, warm hand. </p>
            <p>&quot;Father, Mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer,&quot; 
              she said, with a face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure 
              that she might as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door 
              with a flourish. </p>
            <p>If the stranger had any doubts about his reception, they were set 
              at rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received. Everyone 
              greeted him kindly, for Jo's sake at first, but very soon they liked 
              him for his own. They could not help it, for he carried the talisman 
              that opens all hearts, and these simple people warmed to him at 
              once, feeling even the more friendly because he was poor. For poverty 
              enriches those who live above it, and is a sure passport to truly 
              hospitable spirits. Mr. Bhaer sat looking about him with the air 
              of a traveler who knocks at a strange door, and when it opens, finds 
              himself at home. The children went to him like bees to a honeypot, 
              and establishing themselves on each knee, proceeded to captivate 
              him by rifling his pockets, pulling his beard, and investigating 
              his watch, with juvenile audacity. The women telegraphed their approval 
              to one another, and Mr. March, feeling that he had got a kindred 
              spirit, opened his choicest stores for his guest's benefit, while 
              silent John listened and enjoyed the talk, but said not a word, 
              and Mr. Laurence found it impossible to go to sleep. </p>
            <p>If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie's behavior would have 
              amused her, for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something like 
              suspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe 
              the newcomer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not last 
              long. He got interested in spite of himself, and before he knew 
              it, was drawn into the circle. For Mr. Bhaer talked well in this 
              genial atmosphere, and did himself justice. He seldom spoke to Laurie, 
              but he looked at him often, and a shadow would pass across his face, 
              as if regretting his own lost youth, as he watched the young man 
              in his prime. Then his eyes would turn to Jo so wistfully that she 
              would have surely answered the mute inquiry if she had seen it. 
              But Jo had her own eyes to take care of, and feeling that they could 
              not be trusted, she prudently kept them on the little sock she was 
              knitting, like a model maiden aunt. </p>
            <p>A stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh 
              water after a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her several 
              propitious omens. Mr. Bhaer's face had lost the absent-minded expression, 
              and looked all alive with interest in the present moment, actually 
              young and handsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him with 
              Laurie, as she usually did strange men, to their great detriment. 
              Then he seemed quite inspired, though the burial customs of the 
              ancients, to which the conversation had strayed, might not be considered 
              an exhilarating topic. Jo quite glowed with triumph when Teddy got 
              quenched in an argument, and thought to herself, as she watched 
              her father's absorbed face, &quot;How he would enjoy having such 
              a man as my Professor to talk with every day!&quot; Lastly, Mr. 
              Bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black, which made him look more 
              like a gentleman than ever. His bushy hair had been cut and smoothly 
              brushed, but didn't stay in order long, for in exciting moments, 
              he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do, and Jo liked it 
              rampantly erect better than flat, because she thought it gave his 
              fine forehead a Jove-like aspect. Poor Jo, how she did glorify that 
              plain man, as she sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing 
              escape her, not even the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold sleeve-buttons 
              in his immaculate wristbands. </p>
            <p>&quot;Dear old fellow! He couldn't have got himself up with more 
              care if he'd been going a-wooing,&quot; said Jo to herself, and 
              then a sudden thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully 
              that she had to drop her ball, and go down after it to hide her 
              face. </p>
            <p>The maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected, however, 
              for though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre, the 
              Professor dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a 
              dive after the little blue ball. Of course they bumped their heads 
              smartly together, saw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, 
              without the ball, to resume their seats, wishing they had not left 
              them. </p>
            <p>Nobody knew where the evening went to, for Hannah skillfully abstracted 
              the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and 
              Mr. Laurence went home to rest. The others sat round the fire, talking 
              away, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal 
              was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out 
              of be, and Demi set his nightgown afire studying the structure of 
              matches, made a move to go. </p>
            <p>&quot;We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all 
              together again once more,&quot; said Jo, feeling that a good shout 
              would be a safe and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her 
              soul. </p>
            <p>They were not all there. But no one found the words thougtless 
              or untrue, for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence, 
              invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the 
              household league that love made disoluble. The little chair stood 
              in its old place. The tidy basket, with the bit of work she left 
              unfinished when the needle grew `so heavy', was still on its accustomed 
              shelf. The beloved instrument, seldom touched now had not been moved, 
              and above it Beth's face, serene and smiling, as in the early days, 
              looked down upon them, seeming to say, &quot;Be happy. I am here.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Play something, Amy. Let them hear how much you have improved,&quot; 
              said Laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil. </p>
            <p>But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded stool, 
              &quot;Not tonight, dear. I can't show off tonight.&quot; </p>
            <p>But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill, for 
              she sang Beth's songs with a tender music in her voice which the 
              best master could not have taught, and touched the listener's hearts 
              with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given 
              her. The room was very still, when the clear voice failed suddenly 
              at the last line of Beth's favorite hymn. It was hard to say... 
            </p>
            <p>Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal; </p>
            <p>and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling 
              that her welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth's kiss. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Now, we must finish with Mignon's song, for Mr. Bhaer sings 
              that,&quot; said Jo, before the pause grew painful. And Mr. Bhaer 
              cleared his throat with a gratified &quot;Hem!&quot; as he stepped 
              into the corner where Jo stood, saying... </p>
            <p>&quot;You will sing with me? We go excellently well together.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>A pleasing fiction, by the way, for Jo had no more idea of <br>
              music than a grasshopper. But she would have consented if he had 
              <br>
              proposed to sing a whole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless 
              <br>
              of time and tune. It didn't much matter, for Mr. Bhaer <br>
              sang like a true German, heartily and well, and Jo soon subsided 
              <br>
              into a subdued hum, that she might listen to the mellow voice that 
              <br>
              seemed to sing for her alone. <br>
              Know'st thou the land where the citron blooms, </p>
            <p>used to be the Professor's favorite line, for `das land' meant 
              Germany to him, but now he seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth 
              and melody, upon the words... <br>
              <br>
              There, oh there, might I with thee, O, my beloved, go and one listener 
              was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she longed to say 
              she did know the land, and would joyfully depart thither whenever 
              he liked The song was considered a great success, and the singer 
              retired covered with laurels. But a few minutes afterward, he forgot 
              his manners entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet, for 
              she had been introduced simply as `my sister', and on one had called 
              her by her new name since her came. He forgot himself still further 
              when Laurie said, in his most gracious manner, at parting... </p>
            <p>&quot;My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir. Please remember 
              that there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Then the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly 
              illuminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him the most 
              delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met. </p>
            <p>&quot;I too shall go, but I shall gladly come again, if you will 
              gif me leave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will 
              keep me here some days.&quot; </p>
            <p>He spoke to Mrs. March, but he looked at Jo, and the mother's voice 
              gave as cordial an assent as did the daughter's eyes, for Mrs. March 
              was not so blind to her children's interest as Mrs. Moffat supposed. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I suspect that is a wise man,&quot; remarked Mr. March, with 
              placid satisfaction, from the hearthrug, after the last guest had 
              gone. </p>
            <p>&quot;I know he is a good one,&quot; added Mrs. March, with decided 
              approval, as she wound up the clock. </p>
            <p>&quot;I thought you'd like him,&quot; was all Jo said, as she slipped 
              away to her bed. </p>
            <p>She wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the 
              city, and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great 
              honor, somewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact. If 
              she had seen his face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the 
              picture of a severe and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, 
              who appeared to be gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown 
              some light upon the subject, especially when he turned off the gas, 
              and kissed the picture in the dark. </p>

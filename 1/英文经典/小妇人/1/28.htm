            <p> <br>
              Like most other young matrons, Meg began her married life with the 
              determination to be a model housekeeper. John should find home a 
              paradise, he should always see a smiling face, should fare sumptuously 
              every day, and never know the loss of a button. She brought so much 
              love, energy, and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but 
              succeed, in spite of some obstacles. Her paradise was not a tranquil 
              one, for the little woman fussed, was over-anxious to please, and 
              bustled about like a true Martha, cumbered with many cares. She 
              was too tired, sometimes, even to smile, John grew dyspeptic after 
              a course of dainty dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare. 
              As for buttons, she soon learned to wonder where they went, to shake 
              her head over the carelessness of men, and to threaten to make him 
              sew them on himself, and see if his work would stand impatient and 
              clumsy fingers any better than hers. </p>
            <p>They were very happy, even after they discovered that they couldn't 
              live on love alone. John did not find Meg's beauty diminished, though 
              she beamed at him from behind the familiar coffee pot. Nor did Meg 
              miss any of the romance from the daily parting, when her husband 
              followed up his kiss with the tender inquiry, &quot;Shall I send 
              some veal or mutton for dinner, darling?&quot; The little house 
              ceased to be a glorified bower, but it became a home, and the young 
              couple soon felt that it was a change for the better. At first they 
              played keep-house, and frolicked over it like children. Then John 
              took steadily to business, feeling the cares of the head of a family 
              upon his shoulders, and Meg laid by her cambric wrappers, put on 
              a big apron, and fell to work, as before said, with more energy 
              than discretion. </p>
            <p>While the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. Cornelius's 
              Receipt Book as if it were a mathematical exercise, working out 
              the problems with patience and care. Sometimes her family were invited 
              in to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would 
              be privately dispatched with a batch of failures, which were to 
              be concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little 
              Hummels. An evening with John over the account books usually produced 
              a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would 
              ensue, during which the poor man was put through a course of bread 
              pudding, hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his soul, although 
              he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude. Before the golden mean was 
              found, however, Meg added to her domestic possessions what young 
              couples seldom get on long without, a family jar. </p>
            <p>Fired a with housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with 
              homemade preserves, she undertook to put up her own currant jelly. 
              John was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and 
              an extra quantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe and 
              were to be attended to at once. As John firmly believed that `my 
              wife' was equal to anything, and took a natural pride in her skill, 
              he resolved that she should be gratified, and their only crop of 
              fruit laid by in a most pleasing form for winter use. Home came 
              four dozen delightful little pots, half a barrel of sugar, and a 
              small boy to pick the currants for her. With her pretty hair tucked 
              into a little cap, arms bared to the elbow, and a checked apron 
              which had a coquettish look in spite of the bib, the young housewife 
              fell to work, feeling no doubts about her success, for hadn't she 
              seen Hannah do it hundreds of times? The array of pots rather amazed 
              her at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and the nice little 
              jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg resolved to fill 
              them all, and spend a long day picking, boiling, straining, and 
              fussing over her jelly. She did her best, she asked advice of Mrs. 
              Cornelius, she racked her brain to remember what Hannah did that 
              she left undone, she reboiled, resugared, and restrained, but that 
              dreadful stuff wouldn't `jell'. </p>
            <p>She longed to run home, bib and all, and ask Mother to lend her 
              a hand, but John and she had agreed that they would never annoy 
              anyone with their private worries, experiments, or quarrels. They 
              had laughed over that last word as if the idea it suggested was 
              a most preposterous one, but they had held to their resolve, and 
              whenever they could get on without help they did so, and no one 
              interfered, for Mrs. March had advised the plan. So Meg wrestled 
              alone with the refractory sweetmeats all that hot summer day, and 
              at five o'clock sat down in her topsy-turvey kitchen, wrung her 
              bedaubed hands, lifted up her voice and wept. </p>
            <p>Now, in the first flush of the new life, she had often said, &quot;My 
              husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he 
              likes. I shall always be prepared. There shall be no flurry, no 
              scolding, no discomfort, but a neat house, a cheerful wife, and 
              a good dinner. John, dear, never stop to ask my leave, invite whom 
              you please, and be sure of a welcome from me.&quot; </p>
            <p>How charming that was, to be sure! John quite glowed with pride 
              to hear her say it, and felt what a blessed thing it was to have 
              a superior wife. But, although they had had company from time to 
              time, it never happened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had 
              an opportunity to distinguish herself till now. It always happens 
              so in this vale of tears, there is an inevitability about such things 
              which we can only wonder at, deplore, and bear as we best can. </p>
            <p>If John had not forgotten all about the jelly, it really would 
              have been unpardonable in him to choose that day, of all the days 
              in the year, to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly. Congratulating 
              himself that a handsome repast had been ordered that morning, feeling 
              sure that it would be ready to the minute, and indulging in pleasant 
              anticipations of the charming effect it would produce, when his 
              pretty wife came running out to meet him, he escorted his friend 
              to his mansion, with the irrepressible satisfaction of a young host 
              and husband. </p>
            <p> It is a world of disappointments, as John discovered when he reached 
              the Dovecote. the front door usually stood hospitably open. Now 
              it was not only shut, but locked, and yesterday's mud still adorned 
              the steps. The parlor windows were closed and curtained, no picture 
              of the pretty wife sewing on the piazza, in white, with a distracting 
              little bow in her hair, or a bright-eyed hostess, smiling a shy 
              welcome as she greeted her guest. Nothing of the sort, for not a 
              soul appeared but a sanginary-looking boy asleep under the current 
              bushes. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm afraid something has happened. Step into the garden, 
              Scott, while I look up Mrs. Brooke,&quot; said John, alarmed at 
              the silence and solitude. </p>
            <p>Round the house he hurried, led by a pungent smell of burned sugar, 
              and Mr. Scott strolled after him, with a queer look on his face. 
              He paused discreetly at a distance when Brooke disappeared, but 
              he could both see and hear, and being a bachelor, enjoyed the prospect 
              mightily. </p>
            <p>In the kitchen reigned confusion and despair. One edition of jelly 
              was trickled from pot to pot, another lay upon the floor, and a 
              third was burning gaily on the stove. Lotty, with Teutonic phlegm, 
              was calmly eating bread and currant wine, for the jelly was still 
              in a hopelessly liquid state, while Mrs. Brooke, with her apron 
              over her head, sat sobbing dismally. </p>
            <p>&quot;My dearest girl, what is the matter?&quot; cried John, rushing 
              in, with awful visions of scalded hands, sudden news of affliction, 
              and secret consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Oh, John, I am so tired and hot and cross and worried! I've 
              been at it till I'm all worn out. Do come and help me or I shall 
              die!&quot; And the exhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast, 
              giving him a sweet welcome in every sense of the word, for her pinafore 
              had been baptized at the same time as the floor. </p>
            <p>&quot;What worries you dear? Has anything dreadful happened?&quot; 
              asked the anxious John, tenderly kissing the crown of the little 
              cap, which was all askew. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; sobbed Meg despairingly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Tell me quick, then. Don't cry. I can bear anything better 
              than that. Out with it, love.&quot; &quot;The...The jelly won't 
              jell and I don't know what to do!&quot; </p>
            <p>John Brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward, 
              and the derisive Scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty 
              peal, which put the finishing stroke to poor Meg's woe. </p>
            <p>&quot;Is that all? Fling it out of the window, and don't bother 
              any more about it. I'll buy you quarts if you want it, but for heaven's 
              sake don't have hysterics, for I've brought Jack Scott home to dinner, 
              and...&quot; </p>
            <p>John got no further, for Meg cast him off, and clasped her hands 
              with a tragic gesture as she fell into a chair, exclaiming in a 
              tone of mingled indignation, reproach, and dismay... </p>
            <p>&quot;A man to dinner, and everything in a mess! John Brooke, how 
              could you do such a thing?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Hush, he's in the garden! I forgot the confounded jelly, 
              but it can't be helped now,&quot; said John, surveying the prospect 
              with an anxious eye. </p>
            <p>&quot;You ought to have sent word, or told me this morning, and 
              you ought to have remembered how busy I was,&quot; continued Meg 
              petulantly, for even turtledoves will peck when ruffled. </p>
            <p>&quot;I didn't know it this morning, and there was no time to send 
              word, for I met him on the way out. I never thought of asking leave, 
              when you have always told me to do as I liked. I never tried it 
              before, and hang me if I ever do again!&quot; added John, with an 
              aggrieved air. </p>
            <p>&quot;I should hope not! Take him away at once. I can't see him, 
              and there isn't any dinner.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I like that! Where's the beef and vegetables I sent 
              home, and the pudding you promised?&quot; cried John, rushing to 
              the larder.</p>
            <p>&quot;I hadn't time to cook anything. I meant to dine at Mother's. 
              I'm sorry, but I was so busy,&quot; and Meg's tears began again. 
            </p>
            <p>John was a mild man, but he was human, and after a long day's work 
              to come home tired, hungry, and hopeful, to find a chaotic house, 
              an empty table, and a cross wife was not exactly conductive to repose 
              of mind or manner. He restrained himself however, and the little 
              squall would have blown over, but for one unlucky word. </p>
            <p> &quot;It's a scrape, I acknowledge, but if you will lend a hand, 
              we'll pull through and have a good time yet. Don't cry, dear, but 
              just exert yourself a bit, and fix us up something to eat. We're 
              both as hungry as hunters, so we shan't mind what it is. Give us 
              the cold meat, and bread and cheese. We won't ask for jelly.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>He meant it to be a good-natured joke, but that one word sealed 
              his fate. Meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her sad failure, 
              and the last atom of patience vanished as he spoke.</p>
            <p>&quot;You must get yourself out of the scrape as you can. I'm too 
              used up to `exert' myself for anyone. It's like a man to propose 
              a bone and vulgar bread and cheese for company. I won't have anything 
              of the sort in my house. Take that Scott up to Mother's, and tell 
              him I'm away, sick, dead, anything. I won't see him, and you two 
              can laugh at me and my jelly as much as you like. You won't have 
              anything else here.&quot; And having delivered her defiance all 
              on one breath, Meg cast away her pinafore and precipitately left 
              the field to bemoan herself in her own room. </p>
            <p>What those two creatures did in her absence, she never knew, but 
              Mr. scott was not taken `up to Mother's', and when Meg descended, 
              after they had strolled away together, she found traces of a promiscuous 
              lunch which filled her with horror. Lotty reported that they had 
              eaten &quot;a much, and greatly laughed, and the master bid her 
              throw away all the sweet stuff, and hide the pots.&quot; </p>
            <p>Meg longed to go and tell Mother, but a sense of shame at her own 
              short comings, of loyalty to John, &quot;who might be cruel, but 
              nobody should know it,&quot; restrained her, and after a summary 
              cleaning up, she dressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait 
              for John to come and be forgiven. </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, John didn't come, not seeing the matter in that 
              light. He had carried it off as a good joke with Scott, excused 
              his little wife as well as he could, and played the host so hospitably 
              that his friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come 
              again, but John was angry, though he did not show it, he felt that 
              Meg had deserted him in his hour of need. &quot;It wasn't fair to 
              tell a man to bring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and 
              when he took you at your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave 
              him in the lurch, to be laughed at or pitied. No, by George, it 
              wasn't! And Meg must know it.&quot; </p>
            <p>He had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the flurry was 
              over and he strolled home after seeing Scott off, a milder mood 
              came over him. &quot;Poor little thing! It was hard upon her when 
              she tried so heartily to please me. She was wrong, of course, but 
              then she was young. I must be patient and teach her.&quot; He hoped 
              she had not gone home--he hated gossip and interference. For a minute 
              he was ruffled again at the mere thought of it, and then the fear 
              that Meg would cry herself sick softened his heart, and sent him 
              on at a quicker pace, resolving to be calm and kind, but firm, quite 
              firm, and show her where she had failed in her duty to her spouse. 
            </p>
            <p>Meg likewise resolved to be `calm and kind, but firm', and show 
              him his duty. She longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and 
              be kissed and comforted, as she was sure of being, but, of course, 
              she did nothing of the sort, and when she saw John coming, began 
              to hum quite naturally, as she rocked and sewed, like a lady of 
              leisure in her best parlor. </p>
            <p>John was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe, but 
              feeling that his dignity demanded the first apology, he made none, 
              only came leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly 
              relevant remark, &quot;We are going to have a new moon, my dear.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I've no objection,&quot; was Meg's equally soothing remark. 
              A few other topics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke 
              and wet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation languished. John 
              went to one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it, 
              figuratively speaking. Meg went to the other window, and sewed as 
              if new rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life. 
              Neither spoke. Both looked quite `calm and firm', and both felt 
              desperately uncomfortable. </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; thought Meg, &quot;married life is very trying, 
              and does need infinite patience as well as love, as Mother says.&quot; 
              The word `Mother' suggested other maternal counsels given long ago, 
              and received with unbelieving protests. </p>
            <p>&quot;John is a good man, but he has his faults, and you must learn 
              to see and bear with them, remembering your own. He is very decided, 
              but never will be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently. 
              He is very accurate, and particular about the truth--a good trait, 
              though you call him `fussy'. Never deceive him by look or word, 
              Meg, and he will give you the confidence you deserve, the support 
              you need. He has a temper, not like ours--one flash and then all 
              over--but the white, still anger that is seldom stirred, but once 
              kindled is hard to quench. Be careful, be very careful, not to wake 
              his anger against yourself, for peace and happiness depend on keeping 
              his respect. Watch yourself, be the first to ask pardon if you both 
              err, and guard against the little piques, misunderstandings, and 
              hasty words that often pave the way for bitter sorrow and regret.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p> These words came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset, 
              especially the last. This was the first serious disagreement, her 
              own hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled 
              them, her own anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John 
              coming home to such a scene quite melted her heart. She glanced 
              at him with tears in her eyes, but he did not see them. She put 
              down her work and got up, thinking, &quot;I will be the first to 
              say, `Forgive me', but he did not seem to hear her. She went very 
              slowly across the room, for pride was hard to swallow, and stood 
              by him, but he did not turn his head. For a minute she felt as if 
              she really couldn't do it, then came the thought, This is the beginning. 
              I'll do my part, and have nothing to reproach myself with,&quot; 
              and stooping sown, she softly kissed her husband on the forehead. 
              Of course that settled it. The penitent kiss was better than a world 
              of words, and John had her on his knee in a minute, saying tenderly... 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots. Forgive 
              me, dear. I never will again!&quot; </p>
            <p>But he did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did Meg, 
              both declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made, for 
              family peace was preserved in that little family jar. </p>
            <p>After this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation, 
              and served him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the 
              first course, on which occasion she was so gay and gracious, and 
              made everything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he 
              was a lucky fellow, and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood 
              all the way home. </p>
            <p>In the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg. Sallie Moffat 
              renewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of gossip 
              at the little house, or inviting `that poor dear' to come in and 
              spend the day at the big house. It was pleasant, for in dull weather 
              Meg often felt lonely. All were busy at home, John absent till night, 
              and nothing to do but sew, or read, or potter about. So it naturally 
              fell out that Meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with 
              her friend. Seeing Sallie's pretty things made her long for such, 
              and pity herself because she had not got them. Sallie was very kind, 
              and often offered her the coveted trifles, but Meg declined them, 
              knowing that John wouldn't like it, and then this foolish little 
              woman went and did what John disliked even worse. </p>
            <p>She knew her husband's income, and she loved to feel that he trusted 
              her, not only with his happiness, but what some men seem to value 
              more--his money. She knew where it was, was free to take what she 
              liked, and all he asked was that she should keep account of every 
              penny, pay bills once a month, and remember that she was a poor 
              man's wife. Till now she had done well, been prudent and exact, 
              kept her little account books neatly, and showed them to him monthly 
              without fear. But that autumn the serpent got into Meg's paradise, 
              and tempted her like many a modern Eve, not with apples, but with 
              dress. Meg didn't like to be pitied and made to feel poor. It irritated 
              her, but she was ashamed to confess it, and now and then she tried 
              to console herself by buying something pretty, so that Sallie needn't 
              think she had to economize. She always felt wicked after it, for 
              the pretty things were seldom necessaries, but then they cost so 
              little, it wasn't worth worrying about, so the trifles increased 
              unconsciously, and in the shopping excursions she was no longer 
              a passive looker-on. </p>
            <p>But the trifles cost more than one would imagine, and when she 
              cast up her accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather 
              scared her. John was busy that month and left the bills to her, 
              the next month he was absent, but the third he had a grand quarterly 
              settling up, and Meg never forgot it. A few days before she had 
              done a dreadful thing, and it weighed upon her conscience. Sallie 
              had been buying silks, and Meg longed for a new one, just a handsome 
              light one for parties, her black silk was so common, and thin things 
              for evening wear were only proper for girls. Aunt March usually 
              gave the sisters a present of twenty-five dollars apiece at New 
              Year's. That was only a month to wait, and here was a lovely violet 
              silk going at a bargain, and she had the money, if she only dared 
              to take it. John always said what was his was hers, but would he 
              think it right to spend not only the prospective five-and-twenty, 
              but another five-and-twenty out of the household fund? That was 
              the question. Sallie had urged her to do it, had offered to lend 
              the money, and with the best intentions in life had tempted Meg 
              beyond her strength. In an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely, 
              shimmering folds, and said, &quot;A bargain, I assure, you, ma'am.&quot; 
              She answered, &quot;I'll take it,&quot; and it was cut off and paid 
              for, and Sallie had exulted, and she had laughed as if it were a 
              thing of no consequence, and driven away, feeling as if she had 
              stolen something, and the police were after her.</p>
            <p>When she got home, she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by 
              spreading forth the lovely silk, but it looked less silvery now, 
              didn't become her, after all, and the words `fifty dollars' seemed 
              stamped like a pattern down each breadth. She put it away, but it 
              haunted her, not delightfully as a new dress should, but dreadfully 
              like the ghost of a folly that was not easily laid. When John got 
              out his books that night, Meg's heart sank, and for the first time 
              in her married life, she was afraid of her husband. The kind, brown 
              eyes looked as if they could be stern, and though he was unusually 
              merry, she fancied he had found her out, but didn't mean to let 
              her know it. The house bills were all paid, the books all in order. 
              John had praised her, and was undoing the old pocketbook which they 
              called the `bank', when Meg, knowing that it was quite empty, stopped 
              his hand, saying nervously... </p>
            <p>&quot;You haven't seen my private expense book yet.&quot; </p>
            <p>John never asked to see it, but she always insisted on his doing 
              so, and used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things 
              women wanted, and made him guess what piping was, demand fiercely 
              the meaning of a hug-me-tight, or wonder how a little thing composed 
              of three rosebuds, a bit of velvet, and a pair of strings, could 
              possibly be a bonnet, and cost six dollars. That night he looked 
              as if he would like the fun of quizzing her figures and pretending 
              to be horrified at her extravagance, as he often did, being particularly 
              proud of his prudent wife.</p>
            <p>The little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him. 
              Meg got behind his chair under pretense of smoothing the wrinkles 
              out of his tired forehead, and standing there, she said, with her 
              panic increasing with every word . ..</p>
            <p>&quot;John, dear, I'm ashamed to show you my book, for I've really 
              been dreadfully extravagant lately. I go about so much I must have 
              things, you know, and Sallie advised my getting it, so I did, and 
              my New Year's money will partly pay for it, but I was sorry after 
              I had done it, for I knew you'd think it wrong in me.&quot; </p>
            <p>John laughed, and drew her round beside him, saying goodhumoredly, 
              &quot;Don't go and hide. I won't beat you if you have got a pair 
              of killing boots. I'm rather proud of my wife's feet, and don't 
              mind if she does pay eight or nine dollars for her boots, if they 
              are good ones.&quot; </p>
            <p>That had been one of her last `trifles', and John's eye had fallen 
              on it as he spoke. &quot;Oh, what will he say when he comes to that 
              awful fifty dollars!&quot; thought Meg, with a shiver. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's worse than boots, it's a silk dress,&quot; she said, 
              with the calmness of desperation, for she wanted the worst over. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, dear, what is the `dem'd total', as Mr. Mantalini says?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>That didn't sound like John, and she knew he was looking up at 
              her with the straightforward look that she had always been ready 
              to meet and answer with one as frank till now. She turned the page 
              and her head at the same time, pointing to the sum which would have 
              been bad enough without the fifty, but which was appalling to her 
              with that added. For a minute the room was very still, then John 
              said slowly--but she could feel it cost him an effort to express 
              no displeasure--. . . </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I don't know that fifty is much for a dress, with all 
              the furbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these 
              days.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;It isn't made or trimmed,&quot; sighed Meg, faintly, for 
              a sudden recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed 
              her. </p>
            <p>&quot;Twenty-five yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one 
              small woman, but I've no doubt my wife will look as fine as Ned 
              Moffat's when she gets it on,&quot;said John dryly.</p>
            <p>&quot;I know you are angry, John, but I can't help it. I don't 
              mean to waste your money, and I didn't think those little things 
              would count up so. I can't resist them when I see Sallie buying 
              all she wants, and pitying me because I don't. I try to be contented, 
              but it is hard, and I'm tired of being poor.&quot; </p>
            <p>The last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them, 
              but he did, and they wounded him deeply, for he had denied himself 
              many pleasures for Meg's sake. She could have bitten her tongue 
              out the minute she had said it, for John pushed the books away and 
              got up, saying with a little quiver in his voice, &quot;I was afraid 
              of this. I do my best, Meg.&quot; If he had scolded her, or even 
              shaken her, it would not have broken her heart like those few words. 
              She ran to him and held him close, crying, with repentant tears, 
              &quot;Oh, John, my dear, kind, hard-working boy. I didn't mean it! 
              It was so wicked, so untrue and ungrateful, how could I say it! 
              Oh, how could I say it!&quot; He was very kind, forgave her readily, 
              and did not utter one reproach, but Meg knew that she had done and 
              said a thing which would not be forgotten soon, although he might 
              never allude to it again. She had promised to love him for better 
              or worse, and then she, his wife, had reproached him with his poverty, 
              after spending his earnings recklessly. It was dreadful, and the 
              worst of it was John went on so quietly afterward, just as if nothing 
              had happened, except that he stayed in town later, and worked at 
              night when she had gone to cry herself to sleep. A week or remorse 
              nearly made Meg sick, and the discovery that John had countermanded 
              the order for his new greatcoat reduced her to a state of despair 
              which was pathetic to behold. He had simply said, in answer to her 
              surprised inquiries as to the change, &quot;I can't afford it, my 
              dear.&quot; </p>
            <p>Meg said no more, but a few minutes after he found her in the hall 
              with her face buried in the old greatcoat, crying as if her heart 
              would break. </p>
            <p>They had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her husband 
              better for his poverty, because it seemed to have made a man of 
              him, given him the strength and courage to fight his own way, and 
              taught him a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the 
              natural longings and failures of those he loved. </p>
            <p>Next day she put her pride in her pocket, went to Sallie, told 
              the truth, and asked her to buy the silk as a favor. The good- natured 
              Mrs. Moffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to make her 
              a present of it immediately afterward. Then Meg ordered home the 
              greatcoat, and when John arrived, she put it on, and asked him how 
              he liked her new silk gown. One can imagine what answer he made, 
              how he received his present, and what a blissful state of things 
              ensued. John came home early, Meg gadded no more, and that greatcoat 
              was put on in the morning by a very happy husband, and taken off 
              at night by a most devoted little wife. So the year rolled round, 
              and at midsummer there came to Meg a new experience, the deepest 
              and tenderest of a woman's life. </p>
            <p>Laurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the Dovecote one Saturday, 
              with an excited face, and was received with the clash of cymbals, 
              for Hannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one and the cover 
              in the other. </p>
            <p>&quot;How's the little mamma? Where is everybody? Why didn't you 
              tell me before I came home?&quot; began Laurie in a loud whisper. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Happy as a queen, the dear! Every soul of `em is upstairs 
              a worshipin'. We didn't want no hurrycanes round. Now you go into 
              the parlor, and I'll send `em down to you,&quot; with which somewhat 
              involved reply Hannah vanished, chuckling ecstatically. </p>
            <p>Presently Jo appeared, proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid forth 
              upon a large pillow. Jo's face was very sober, but her eyes twinkled, 
              and there was an odd sound in her voice of repressed emotion of 
              some sort. </p>
            <p>&quot;Shut your eyes and hold out your arms,&quot; she said invitingly. 
            </p>
            <p>Laurie backed precipitately into a corner, and put his hands behind 
              him with an imploring gesture. &quot;No, thank you. I'd rather not. 
              I shall drop it or smash it, as sure as fate.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Then you shan't see your nevvy,&quot; said Jo decidedly, 
              turning as if to go. </p>
            <p>&quot;I will, I will! Only you must be responsible for damages.&quot; 
              And obeying orders, Laurie heroically shut his eyes while something 
              was put into his arms. A peal of laughter from Jo, Amy, Mrs. March, 
              Hannah, and John caused him to open them the next minute, to find 
              himself invested with two babies instead of one. </p>
            <p>No wonder they laughed, for the expression of his face was droll 
              enough to convulse a Quaker, as he stood and stared wildly from 
              the unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such 
              dismay that Jo sat down on the floor and screamed. </p>
            <p>&quot;Twins, by Jupiter!&quot; was all he said for a minute, then 
              turning to the women with an appealing look that was comically piteous, 
              he added, &quot;Take `em quick, somebody! I'm going to laugh, and 
              I shall drop `em.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo rescued his babies, and marched up and down, with one on each 
              are, as if already initiated into the mysteries of babytending, 
              while Laurie laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's the best joke of the season, isn't it? I wouldn't have 
              told you, for I set my heart on surprising you, and I flatter myself 
              I've done it,&quot; said Jo, when she got her breath. </p>
            <p>&quot;I never was more staggered in my life. Isn't it fun? Are 
              they boys? What are you going to name them? Let's have another look. 
              Hold me up, Jo, for upon my life it's one too many for me,&quot; 
              returned Laurie, regarding the infants with the air of a big, benevolent 
              Newfoundland looking at a pair of infantile kittens. </p>
            <p>&quot;Boy and girl. Aren't they beauties?&quot; said the proud 
              papa, beaming upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged 
              angels. </p>
            <p>&quot;Most remarkable children I ever saw. Which is which?&quot; 
              and Laurie bent like a well-sweep to examine the prodigies. </p>
            <p>&quot;Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, 
              French fashion, so you can always tell. Besides, one has blue eyes 
              and one brown. Kiss them, Uncle Teddy,&quot; said wicked Jo. </p>
            <p> &quot;I'm afraid they mightn't like it,&quot; began Laurie, with 
              unusual timidity in such matters. </p>
            <p>&quot;Of course they will, they are used to it now. Do it this 
              minute, sir!&quot; commanded Jo, fearing he might propose a proxy. 
            </p>
            <p>Laurie screwed up his face and obeyed with a gingerly peck at each 
              little cheek that produced another laugh, and made the babies squeal. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;There, I knew they didn't like it! That's the boy, see him 
              kick, he hits out with his fists like a good one. Now then, young 
              Brooke, pitch into a man of your own size, will you?&quot; cried 
              Laurie, delighted with a poke in the face from a tiny fist, flapping 
              aimlessly about. </p>
            <p>&quot;He's to be named John Laurence, and the girl Margaret, after 
              mother and grandmother. We shall call her Daisey, so as not to have 
              two Megs, and I suppose the mannie will be Jack, unless we find 
              a better name,&quot; said Amy, with aunt-like interest. </p>
            <p>&quot;Name him Demijohn, and call him Demi for short,&quot; said 
              Laurie </p>
            <p>&quot;Daisy and Demi, just the thing! I knew Teddy would do it,&quot; 
              cried Jo clapping her hands. </p>
            <p>Teddy certainly had done it that time, for the babies were `Daisy' 
              and `Demi' to the end of the chapter. </p>

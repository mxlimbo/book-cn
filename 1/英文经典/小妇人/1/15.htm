              &quot;November is the most disagreeable month in the whole year,&quot; 
              said Margaret, standing at the window one dull afternoon, looking 
              out at the frostbitten garden. </p>
            <p>&quot;That's the reason I was born in it,&quot; observed Jo pensively, 
              quite unconscious of the blot on her nose. </p>
            <p>&quot;If something very pleasant should happen now, we should think 
              it a delightful month,&quot; said Beth, who took a hopeful view 
              of everything, even November. </p>
            <p>&quot;I dare say, but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this 
              family,&quot; said Meg, who was out of sorts. &quot;We go grubbing 
              along day after day, without a bit of change, and very little fun. 
              We might as well be in a treadmill.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;My patience, how blue we are!&quot; cried Jo. &quot;I don't 
              much wonder, poor dear, for you see other girls having splendid 
              times, while you grind, grind, year in and year out. Oh, don't I 
              wish I could manage things for you as I do for my heroines! You're 
              pretty enough and good enough already, so I'd have some rich relation 
              leave you a fortune unexpectedly. Then you'd dash out as an heiress, 
              scorn everyone who has slighted you, go abroad, and come home my 
              Lady Something in a blaze of splendor and elegance.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;People don't have fortunes left them in that style nowadays, 
              men have to work and women marry for money. It's a dreadfully unjust 
              world,&quot; said Meg bitterly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Jo and I are going to make fortunes for you all. Just wait 
              ten years, and see if we don't,&quot; said Amy, who sat in a corner 
              making mud pies, as Hannah called her little clay models of birds, 
              fruit, and faces. </p>
            <p>&quot;Can't wait, and I'm afraid I haven't much faith in ink and 
              dirt, though I'm grateful for your good intentions. </p>
            <p>Meg sighed, and turned to the frostbitten garden again. Jo groaned 
              and leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude, but 
              Amy spatted away energetically, and Beth, who sat at the other window, 
              said, smiling, &quot;Two pleasant things are going to happen right 
              away. Marmee is coming down the street, and Laurie is tramping through 
              the garden as if he had something nice to tell.&quot; </p>
            <p>In they both came, Mrs. March with her usual question, &quot;Any 
              letter from Father, girls?&quot; and Laurie to say in his persuasive 
              way, &quot;Won't some of you come for a drive? I've been working 
              away at mathematics till my head is in a muddle, and I'm going to 
              freshen my wits by a brisk turn. It's a dull day, but the air isn't 
              bad, and I'm going to take Brooke home, so it will be gay inside, 
              if it isn't out. Come, Jo, you and Beth will go, won't you?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Of course we will.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Much obliged, but I'm busy.&quot; And Meg whisked out her 
              workbasket, for she had agreed with her mother that it was best, 
              for her at least, not to drive too often with the young gentleman. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;We three will be ready in a minute,&quot; cried Amy, running 
              away to wash her hands. </p>
            <p>&quot;Can I do anything for you, Madam Mother?&quot; asked Laurie, 
              leaning over Mrs. March's chair with the affectionate look and tone 
              he always gave her. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, thank you, except call at the office, if you'll be so 
              kind, dear. It's our day for a letter, and the postman hasn't been. 
              Father is as regular as the sun, but there's some delay on the way, 
              perhaps.&quot; </p>
            <p>A sharp ring interrupted her, and a minute after Hannah came in 
              with a letter. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's one of them horrid telegraph things, mum,&quot; she 
              said, handling it as if she was afraid it would explode and do some 
              damage. </p>
            <p>At the word `telegraph', Mrs. March snatched it, read the two lines 
              it contained, and dropped back into her chair as white as if the 
              little paper had sent a bullet to her heart. Laurie dashed downstairs 
              for water, while Meg and Hannah supported her, and Jo read aloud, 
              in a frightened voice... <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Mrs. March: </p>
              <p>Your husband is very ill. Come at once. </p>
              <p><br>
                S. HALE </p>
              <p>Blank Hospital, Washington. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><br>
              How still the room was as they listened breathlessly, how strangely 
              the day darkened outside, and how suddenly the whole world seemed 
              to change, as the girls gathered about their mother, feeling as 
              if all the happiness and support of their lives was about to be 
              taken from them. </p>
            <p>Mrs. March was herself again directly, read the message over, and 
              stretched out her arms to her daughters, saying, in a tone they 
              never forgot, &quot;I shall go at once, but it may be too late. 
              Oh, children, children, help me to bear it!&quot; </p>
            <p>For several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing 
              in the room, mingled with broken words of comfort, tender assurances 
              of help, and hopeful whispers that died away in tears. Poor Hannah 
              was the first to recover, and with unconscious wisdom she set all 
              the rest a good example, for with her, work was panacea for most 
              afflictions. </p>
            <p>&quot;The Lord keep the dear man! I won't waste no time a-cryin', 
              but git your things ready right away, mum,&quot; she said heartily, 
              as she wiped her face on her apron, gave her mistress a warm shake 
              of the hand with her own hard one, and went away to work like three 
              women in one. </p>
            <p>&quot;She's right, there's no time for tears now. Be calm, girls, 
              and let me think.&quot;</p>
            <p>They tried to be calm, poor things, as their mother sat up, looking 
              pale but steady, and put away her grief to think and plan for them. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Where's Laurie?' she asked presently, when she had collected 
              her thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done. </p>
            <p>&quot;Here, ma'am. Oh, let me do something!&quot; cried the boy, 
              hurrying from the next room whither he had withdrawn, feeling that 
              their first sorrow was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to 
              see. </p>
            <p>&quot;Send a telegram saying I will come at once. The next train 
              goes early in the morning. I'll take that.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;What else? The horses are ready. I can go anywhere, do anything,&quot; 
              he said, looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth. </p>
            <p>&quot;Leave a note at Aunt March's. Jo, give me that pen and paper.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages, Jo 
              drew the table before her mother, well knowing that money for the 
              long, sad journey must be borrowed, and feeling as if she could 
              do anything to add to a little to the sum for her father. </p>
            <p>&quot;Now go, dear, but don't kill yourself driving at a desperate 
              pace. There is no need of that.&quot; </p>
            <p>Mrs. March's warning was evidently thrown away, for five minutes 
              later Laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse, riding as 
              if for his life. </p>
            <p>&quot;Jo, run to the rooms, and tell Mrs. King that I can't come. 
              On the way get these things. I'll put them down, they'll be needed 
              and I must go prepared for nursing. Hospital stores are not always 
              good. Beth, go and ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of old 
              wine. I'm not too proud to beg for Father. He shall have the best 
              of everything. Amy, tell Hannah to get down the black trunk, and 
              Meg, come and help me find my things, for I'm half bewildered.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Writing, thinking, and directing all at once might well bewilder 
              the poor lady, and Meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for 
              a little while, and let them work. Everyone scattered like leaves 
              before a gust of wind, and the quiet, happy household was broken 
              up as suddenly as if the paper had been an evil spell. </p>
            <p>Mr. Laurence came hurrying back with Beth, bringing every comfort 
              the kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid, and friendliest 
              promises of protection for the girls during the mother's absence, 
              which comforted her very much. There was nothing he didn't offer, 
              from his own dressing gown to himself as escort. But the last was 
              impossible. Mrs. March would not hear of the old gentleman's undertaking 
              the long journey, yet an expression of relief was visible when he 
              spoke of it, for anxiety ill fits one for traveling. He saw the 
              look, knit his heavy eyebrows, rubbed his hands, and marched abruptly 
              away, saying he'd be back directly. No one had time to think of 
              him again till, as Meg ran through the entry, with a pair of rubbers 
              in one hand and a cup of tea in the other, she came suddenly upon 
              Mr. Brooke. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm very sorry to hear of this, Miss March,&quot; he said, 
              in the kind, quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed 
              spirit. &quot;I came to offer myself as escort to your mother. Mr. 
              Laurence has commissions for me in Washington, and it will give 
              me real satisfaction to be of service to her there.&quot; </p>
            <p>Down dropped the rubbers, and the tea was very near following, 
              as Meg put out her hand, with a face so full of gratitude that Mr. 
              Brooke would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than 
              the trifling one of time and comfort which he was about to take. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;How kind you all are! Mother will accept, I'm sure, and 
              it will be such a relief to know that she has someone to take care 
              of her. Thank you very, very much!&quot;</p>
            <p>Meg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something 
              in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling 
              tea, and lead the way into the parlor, saying she would call her 
              mother.</p>
            <p>Everything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a note 
              from Aunt March, enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines repeating 
              what she had often said before, that she had always told them it 
              was absurd for March to go into the army, always predicted that 
              no good would come of it, and she hoped they would take her advice 
              the next time. Mrs. March put the note in the fire, the money in 
              her purse, and went on with her preparations, with her lips folded 
              tightly in a way which Jo would have understood if she had been 
              there. </p>
            <p>The short afternoon wore away. All other errands were done, and 
              Meg and her mother busy at some necessary needlework, while Beth 
              and Amy goth tea, and Hannah finished her ironing with what she 
              called a `slap and a bang', but still Jo did not come. They began 
              to get anxious, and Laurie went off to find her, for no one knew 
              what freak Jo might take into her head. He missed her, however, 
              and she came walking in with a very queer expression of countenance, 
              for there was a mixture of fun and fear, satisfaction and regret 
              in it, which puzzled the family as much as did the roll of bills 
              she laid before her mother, saying with a little choke in her voice, 
              &quot;That's my contribution toward making Father comfortable and 
              bringing him home!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;My dear, where did you get it? Twenty-five dollars! Jo, I 
              hope you haven't done anything rash?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, it's mine honestly. I didn't beg, borrow, or steal it. 
              I earned it, and I don't think you'll blame me, for I only sold 
              what was my own.&quot; </p>
            <p>As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet, and a general outcry arose, 
              for all her abundant hair was cut short. </p>
            <p>&quot;Your hair! Your beautiful hair!&quot; &quot;Oh, Jo, how could 
              you? Your one beauty.&quot; &quot;My dear girl, there was no need 
              of this.&quot; &quot;She doesn't look like my Jo any more, but I 
              love her dearly for it!&quot; </p>
            <p>As everyone exclaimed, and Beth hugged the cropped head tenderly, 
              Jo assumed an indifferent air, which did not deceive anyone a particle, 
              and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she 
              liked it, &quot;It doesn't affect the fate of the nation, so don't 
              wail, Beth. It will be good for my vanity, I getting too proud of 
              my wig. It will do my brains good to have that mop taken off. My 
              head feels deliciously light and cool, and the barber said I could 
              soon have a curly crop, which will be boyish, becoming, and easy 
              to keep in order. I'm satisfied, so please take the money and let's 
              have supper.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Tell me all about it, Jo. I am not quite satisfied, but I 
              can't blame you, for I know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity, 
              as you call it, to your love. But, my dear, it was not necessary, 
              and I'm afraid you will regret it one of these days,&quot; said 
              Mrs. March. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I won't!&quot; returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved 
              that her prank was not entirely condemned. </p>
            <p>&quot;What made you do it?&quot; asked Amy, who would as soon have 
              thought of cutting off her head as her pretty hair. </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I was wild to to something for Father,&quot; replied 
              Jo, as they gathered about the table, for healthy young people can 
              eat even in the midst of trouble. &quot;I hate to borrow as much 
              as Mother does, and I knew Aunt March would croak, she always does, 
              if you ask for a ninepence. Meg gave all her quarterly salary toward 
              the rent, and I only got some clothes with mine, so I felt wicked, 
              and was bound to have some money, if I sold the nose off my face 
              to get it.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;You needn't feel wicked, my child! You had no winter things 
              and got the simplest with your own hard earnings,&quot; said Mrs. 
              March with a look that warmed Jo's heart. </p>
            <p>&quot;I hadn't the least idea of selling my hair at first, but 
              as I went along I kept thinking what I could do, and feeling as 
              if I'd like to dive into some of the rich stores and help myself. 
              In a barber's window I saw tails of hair with the prices marked, 
              and one black tail, not so thick as mine, was forty dollars. It 
              came to me all of a sudden that I had one thing to make money out 
              of, and without stopping to think, I walked in, asked if they bought 
              hair, and what they would give for mine.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't see how you dared to do it,&quot; said Beth in a 
              tone of awe. </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived 
              to oil his hair. He rather stared at first, as if he wasn't used 
              to having girls bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair. 
              He said he didn't care about mine, it wasn't the fashionable color, 
              and he never paid much for it in the first place. The work he put 
              it into it made it dear, and so on. It was getting late, and I was 
              afraid if it wasn't done right away that I shouldn't have it done 
              at all, and you know when I start to do a thing, I hate to give 
              it up. So I begged him to take it, and told him why I was in such 
              a hurry. It was silly, I dare say, but it changed his mind, for 
              I got rather excited, and told the story in my topsy-turvy way, 
              and his wife heard, and said so kindly, `Take it, Thomas, and oblige 
              the young lady. I'd do as much for our Jimmy any day if I had a 
              spire of hair worth selling.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;Who was Jimmy?&quot; asked Amy, who liked to have things 
              explained as they went along. </p>
            <p>&quot;Her son, she said, who was in the army. How friendly such 
              things make strangers feel, don't they? She talked away all the 
              time the man clipped, and diverted my mind nicely.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Didn't you feel dreadfully when the first cut came?&quot; 
              asked Meg, with a shiver.</p>
            <p>&quot;I took a last look at my hair while the man got his things, 
              and that was the end of it. I never snivel over trifles like that. 
              I will confess, though, I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair 
              laid out on the table, and felt only the short rough ends of my 
              head. It almost seemed as if I'd an arm or leg off. The woman saw 
              me look at it, and picked out a long lock for me to keep. I'll give 
              it to you, Marmee, just to remember past glories by, for a crop 
              is so comfortable I don't think I shall ever have a mane again.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. March folded the wavy chestnut lock, and laid it away with 
              a short gray one in her desk. She only said, &quot;Thank you, deary,&quot; 
              but something in her face made the girls change the subject, and 
              talk as cheerfully as they could about Mr. Brooke's kindness, the 
              prospect of a fine day tomorrow, and the happy times they would 
              have when Father came home to be nursed. </p>
            <p>No one wanted to go to bed when at ten o'clock Mrs. March put by 
              the last finished job, and said, &quot;Come girls.&quot; Beth went 
              to the piano and played the father's favorite hymn. All began bravely, 
              but broke down one by one till Beth was left alone, singing with 
              all her heart, for to her music was always a sweet consoler. </p>
            <p>&quot;Go to bed and don't talk, for we must be up early and shall 
              need all the sleep we can get. Good night, my darlings,&quot; said 
              Mrs. March, as the hymn ended, for no one cared to try another. 
            </p>
            <p>They kissed her quietly, and went to bed as silently as if the 
              dear invalid lay in the next room. Beth and Amy soon fell asleep 
              in spite of the great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most 
              serious thoughts she had ever known in her short life. Jo lay motionless, 
              and her sister fancied that she was asleep, till a stifled sob made 
              her exclaim, as she touched a wet cheek... </p>
            <p>&quot;Jo, dear, what is it? Are you crying about father?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;No, not now.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;What then?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;My...My hair!&quot; burst out poor Jo, trying vainly to smother 
              her emotion in the pillow. </p>
            <p>It did not seem at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed 
              the afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm not sorry,&quot; protested Jo, with a choke. &quot;I'd 
              do it again tomorrow, if I could. It's only the vain part of me 
              that goes and cries in this silly way. Don't tell anyone, it's all 
              over now. I thought you were asleep, so I just made a little private 
              moan for my one beauty. How came you to be awake?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I can't sleep, I'm so anxious,&quot; said Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;Think about something pleasant, and you'll soon drop off.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I tried it, but felt wider awake than ever.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;What did you think of?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Handsome faces--eyes particularly,&quot; answered Meg, smiling 
              to herself in the dark. </p>
            <p>&quot;What color do you like best?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Brown, that is, sometimes. Blue are lovely.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo, laughed, and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk, then amiably 
              promised to make her hair curl, and fell asleep to dream of living 
              in her castle in the air. </p>
            <p>The clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still 
              as a figure glided quietly from bed to bed, smoothing a coverlet 
              here, settling a pillow there, and pausing to look long and tenderly 
              at eachunconscious face, to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed, 
              and to pray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter. As she 
              lifted the curtain to look out into the dreary night, the moon broke 
              suddenly from behind the clouds and shone upon her like a bright, 
              benignant face, which seemed to whisper in the silence,&quot; Be 
              comforted, dear soul! There is always light behind the clouds.&quot;

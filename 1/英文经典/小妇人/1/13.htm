            <p> <br>
              Laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one warm 
              September afternoon, wondering what his neighbors were about, but 
              too lazy to go and find out. He was in one of his moods, for the 
              day had been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory, and he was wishing 
              he could live it over again. The hot weather made him indolent, 
              and he had shirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke's patience to the 
              utmost, displeased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon, 
              frightened the maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously 
              hinting that one of his dogs was going mad, and, after high words 
              with the stableman about some fancied neglect of his horse, he had 
              flung himself into his hammock to fume over the stupidity of the 
              world in general,till the peace of the lovely day quieted him in 
              spite of himself. Staring up into the green gloom of the horse-chestnut 
              trees above him, he dreamed dreams of all sorts, and was just imagining 
              himself tossing on the ocean in a voyage round the world, when the 
              sound of voices brought him ashore in a flash. Peeping through the 
              meshes of the hammock, he saw the Marches coming out, as if bound 
              on some expedition. </p>
            <p>&quot;What in the world are those girls about now?&quot; thought 
              Laurie, opening his sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there was 
              something rather peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors. Each 
              wore a large, flapping hat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, 
              and carried a long staff. Meg had a cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, 
              and Amy a portfolio. All walked quietly through the garden, out 
              at the little back gate, and began to climb the hill that lay between 
              the house and river. </p>
            <p> &quot;Well, that's cool,&quot; said Laurie to himself, &quot;to 
              have a picnic and never ask me! They can't be going in the boat, 
              for they haven't got the key. Perhaps they forgot it. I'll take 
              it to them, and see what's going on.&quot; </p>
            <p>Though possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him some time to 
              find one, then there was a hunt for the key, which was at last discovered 
              in his pocket, so that the girls were quite out of sight when leaped 
              the fence and ran after them. Taking the shortest way to the boathouse, 
              he waited for them to appear, but no one came, and he went up the 
              hill to take an observation. A grove of pines covered one part of 
              it, and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than 
              the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Here's a landscape!&quot; thought Laurie, peeping through 
              the bushes, and looking wide-awake and good-natured already. </p>
            <p>It was a rather pretty little picture, for the sisters sat together 
              in the shady nook, with sun and shadow flickering over them, the 
              aromatic wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks, and 
              all the little wood people going on with their affairs as if these 
              were no strangers but old friends. Meg sat upon her cushion, sewing 
              daintily with her white hands, and looking as fresh and sweet as 
              a rose in her pink dress among the green. Beth was sorting the cones 
              that lay thick under the hemlock near by, for she made pretty things 
              with them. Amy was sketching a group of ferns, and Jo was knitting 
              as she read aloud. A shadow passed over the boy's face as he watched 
              them, feeling that he ought to go away because uninvited, yet lingering 
              because home seemed very lonely and this quiet party in the woods 
              most attractive to his restless spirit. He stood so still that a 
              squirrel, busy with it's harvesting, ran dawn a pine close beside 
              him, saw him suddenly and skipped back, scolding so shrilly that 
              Beth looked up, espied the wistful face behind the birches, and 
              beckoned with a reassuring smile. </p>
            <p>&quot;May I come in, please? Or shall I be a bother?&quot; he asked, 
              advancing slowly. </p>
            <p>Meg lifted her eyebrows, but Jo scowled at her defiantly and said 
              at once, &quot;Of course you may. We should have asked you before, 
              only we thought you wouldn't care for such a girl's game as this.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I always like your games, but if Meg doesn't want me, I'll 
              go away.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I've no objection, if you do something. It's against the 
              rules to be idle here,&quot; replied Meg gravely but graciously. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Much obliged. I'll do anything if you'll let me stop a bit, 
              for it's as dull as the Desert of Sahara down there. Shall I sew, 
              read, cone, draw, or do all at once? Bring on your bears. I'm ready.&quot; 
              And Laurie sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Finish this story while I set my heel,&quot; said Jo, handing 
              him the book. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes'm.&quot; was the meek answer, as he began, doing his 
              best to prove his gratitude for the favor of admission into the 
              `Busy Bee Society'. </p>
            <p>The story was not a long one, and when it was finished, he ventured 
              to ask a few questions as a reward of merit. </p>
            <p>&quot;Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive 
              and charming institution is a new one?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Would you tell him?&quot; asked Meg of her sisters. </p>
            <p>&quot;He'll laugh,&quot; said Amy warningly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Who cares?&quot; said Jo. </p>
            <p>&quot;I guess he'll like it,&quot; added Beth. </p>
            <p>&quot;Of course I shall! I give you my word I won't laugh. Tell 
              away, Jo, and don't be afraid.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;The idea of being afraid of you! Well, you see we used to 
              play Pilgrim's Progress, and we have been going on with it in earnest, 
              all winter and summer.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; said Laurie, nodding wisely. </p>
            <p>&quot;Who told you?&quot; demanded Jo. </p>
            <p>&quot;Spirits.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I did. I wanted to amuse him one night when you were 
              all away, and he was rather dismal. He did like it, so don't scold, 
              Jo,&quot; said Beth meekly. </p>
            <p>&quot;You can't keep a secret. Never mind, it saves trouble now.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Go on, please,&quot; said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed 
              in her work, looking a trifle displeased. </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, didn't she tell you about this new plan of ours? Well, 
              we have tried not to waste our holiday, but each has had a task 
              and worked at it with a will. The vacation is nearly over, the stints 
              are all done, and we are ever so glad that we didn't dawdle.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Yes, I should think so,&quot; and Laurie thought regretfully 
              of his own idle days. &quot;Mother likes to have us out-of-doors 
              as much as possible, so we bring our work here and have nice times. 
              For the fun of it we bring our things in these bags, wear the old 
              hats, use poles to climb the hill, and play pilgrims, as we used 
              to do years ago. We call this hill the Delectable Mountain, for 
              we can look far away and see the country where we hope to live some 
              time.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for through an opening 
              in the wood one could look cross the wide, blue river, the meadows 
              on the other side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to 
              the green hills that rose to meet the sky. The sun was low, and 
              the heavens glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset. Gold and 
              purple clouds lay on the hilltops, and rising high into the ruddy 
              light were silvery white peaks that shone like the airy spires of 
              some Celestial City. </p>
            <p>&quot;How beautiful that is!&quot; said Laurie softly, for he was 
              quick to see and feel beauty of any kind. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's often so, and we like to watch it, for it is never the 
              same, but always splendid,&quot; replied Amy, wishing she could 
              paint it. </p>
            <p>&quot;Jo talks about the country where we hope to live sometime--the 
              real country, she means, with pigs and chickens and haymaking.It 
              would be nice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real, 
              and we could ever go to it,&quot; said Beth musingly. </p>
            <p>&quot;There is a lovelier country even than that, where we shall 
              go, by-and-by, when we are good enough,&quot; answered Meg with 
              her sweetest voice. </p>
            <p>&quot;It seems so long to wait, so hard to do. I want to fly away 
              at once, as those swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;You'll get there, Beth, sooner or later, no fear of that,&quot; 
              said Jo. &quot;I'm the one that will have to fight and work, and 
              climb and wait, and maybe never get in after all.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;you'll have me for company, if that's any comfort. I shall 
              have to do a deal of traveling before I come in sight of your Celestial 
              City. If I arrive late, you'll say a good word for me, won't you, 
              Beth?&quot; </p>
            <p>Something in the boy's face troubled his little friend, but she 
              said cheerfully, with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds, &quot;If 
              people really want to go, and really try all their lives, I think 
              they will get in, for I don't believe there are any locks on that 
              door or any guards at the gate. I always imagine it is as it is 
              in the picture, where the shining ones stretch out their hands to 
              welcome poor Christian as he comes up from the river. </p>
            <p> &quot;Wouldn't it be fun if all the castles in the air which we 
              make could come true, and we could live in them?&quot; said Jo, 
              after a little pause. </p>
            <p>&quot;I've made such quantities it would be hard to choose which 
              I'd have,&quot; said Laurie, lying flat and throwing cones at the 
              squirrel who had betrayed him. </p>
            <p>&quot;You'd have to take your favorite one. What is it?&quot; asked 
              Meg.</p>
            <p>&quot;If I tell mine, will you tell yours?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, if the girls will too.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;We will. Now, Laurie.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;After I'd seen as much of the world as I want to, I'd like 
              to settle in Germany and have just as much music as I choose. I'm 
              to be a famous musician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear 
              me. And I'm never to be bothered about money or business, but just 
              enjoy myself and live for what I like. That's my favorite castle. 
              What's yours, Meg?&quot; </p>
            <p>Margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved 
              a brake before her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while 
              she said slowly, &quot;I should like a lovely house, full of all 
              sorts of luxurious things--nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture, 
              pleasant people, and heaps of money. I am to be mistress of it, 
              and manage it as I like, with plenty of servants, so I never need 
              work a bit. How I should enjoy it! For I wouldn't be idle, but do 
              good, and make everyone love me dearly.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Wouldn't you have a master for your castle in the air?&quot; 
              asked Laurie slyly. </p>
            <p>&quot;I said `pleasant people', you know,&quot; And Meg carefully 
              tied up her shoe as she spoke, so that no one saw her face. </p>
            <p>&quot;Why don't you say you'd have a splendid, wise, good husband 
              and some angelic little children? You know your castle wouldn't 
              be perfect without,&quot; said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies 
              yet, and rather scorned romance, except in books. </p>
            <p>&quot;You'd have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in yours,&quot; 
              answered Meg petulantly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Wouldn't I though? I'd have a stable full of Arabian steeds, 
              rooms piled high with books, and I'd write out of a magic inkstand, 
              so that my works should be as famous as Laurie's music. I want to 
              do something splendid before I go into my castle, something heroic 
              or wonderful that won't be forgotten after I'm dead. I don't know 
              what, but I'm on the watch for it, and mean to astonish you all 
              some day. I think I shall write books, and get rich and famous, 
              that would suit me, so that is my favorite dream.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Mine is to stay at home safe with Father and Mother, and 
              help take care of the family,&quot; said Beth contentedly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't you wish for anything else?&quot; asked Laurie. &quot;Since 
              I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied. I only wish we 
              may all keep well and be together, nothing else.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;I have ever so many wishes, but the pet one is to be an 
              artist, and go to Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best artist 
              in the whole world,&quot; was Amy's modest desire. </p>
            <p>&quot;We're an ambitious set, aren't we? Every one of us, but Beth, 
              wants to be rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect. I do 
              wonder if any of us will ever get our wishes,&quot; said Laurie, 
              chewing grass like a meditative calf. </p>
            <p>&quot;I've got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can 
              unlock the door remains to be seen,&quot; observed Jo mysteriously. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I've got the key to mine, but I'm not allowed to try it. 
              Hang college!&quot; muttered Laurie with an impatient sigh. </p>
            <p>&quot;Here's mine!&quot; and Amy waved her pencil. </p>
            <p>&quot;I haven't got any,&quot; said Meg forlornly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, you have,&quot; said Laurie at once. </p>
            <p>&quot;Where?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;In your face.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Nonsense, that's of no use.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Wait and see if it doesn't bring you something worth having,&quot; 
              replied the boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little secret 
              which he fancied he knew. </p>
            <p>Meg colored behind the brake, but asked no questions and looked 
              across the river with the same expectant expression which Mr. Brooke 
              had worn when he told the story of the knight. </p>
            <p>&quot;If we are all alive ten years hence, let's meet, and see 
              how many of us have got our wishes, or how much nearer we are then 
              than now,&quot; said Jo, always ready with a plan. </p>
            <p>&quot;Bless me! How old I shall be, twenty-seven!&quot; exclaimed 
              Meg, who felt grown up already, having just reached seventeen. </p>
            <p>&quot;You and I will be twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-four, and 
              Amy twenty-two. What a venerable party!&quot; said Jo. </p>
            <p>&quot;I hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that 
              time, but I'm such a lazy dog, I'm afraid I shall dawdle, Jo.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;You need a motive, Mother says, and when you get it, she 
              is sure you'll work splendidly.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Is she? By Jupiter, I will, if I only get the chance!&quot; 
              cried Laurie, sitting up with sudden energy. &quot;I ought to be 
              satisfied to please Grandfather, and I do try, but it's working 
              against the grain, you see, and comes hard. He wants me to be an 
              India merchant, as he was, and I'd rather be shot. I hate tea and 
              sild and spices, and every sort of rubbish his old ships bring, 
              and I don't care how soon they go to the bottom when I own them. 
              Going to college ought to satisfy him, for if I give him four years 
              he ought to let me off from the business. But he's set, and I've 
              got to do just as he did, unless I break away and please myself, 
              as my father did. If there was anyone left to stay with the old 
              gentleman, I'd do it tomorrow.&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat into 
              execution on the slightest provocation, for he was growing up very 
              fast and, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man's hatred 
              of subjection, a young man's restless longing to try the world for 
              himself. </p>
            <p>&quot;I advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never 
              come home again till you have tried your own way,&quot; said Jo, 
              whose imagination was fired by the thought of such a daring exploit, 
              and whose sympathy was excited by what she called `Teddy's Wrongs'. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;That's not right, Jo. You mustn't talk in that way, and 
              Lauriemustn't take your bad advice. You should do just what your 
              grandfather wishes, my dear boy,&quot; said Meg in her most maternal 
              tone. &quot;Do your best at college, and when he sees that you try 
              to please him, I'm sure he won't be hard on you or unjust to you. 
              As you say, there is no one else to stay with and love him, and 
              you'd never forgive yourself if you left him without his permission. 
              Don't be dismal or fret, but do your duty and you'll get your reward, 
              as good Mr. Brooke has, by being respected and loved.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;What do you know about him?&quot; asked Laurie, grateful 
              for the good advice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn 
              the conversation from himself after his unusual outbreak. </p>
            <p>&quot;Only what your grandpa told us about him, how he took good 
              care of his own mother till she died, and wouldn't go abroad as 
              tutor to some nice person because he wouldn't leave her. And how 
              he provides now for an old woman who nursed his mother, and never 
              tells anyone, but is just as generous and patient and good as he 
              can be.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;So he is, dear old fellow!&quot; said Laurie heartily, as 
              Meg paused, looking flushed and earnest with her story. &quot;It's 
              like Grandpa to find out all about him without letting him know, 
              and to tell all his goodness to others, so that they might like 
              him. Brooke couldn't understand why your mother was so kind to him, 
              asking him over with me and treating him in her beautiful friendly 
              way. He thought she was just perfect, and talked about it for days 
              and days, and went on about you all in flaming style. If ever I 
              do get my wish, you see what I'll do for Booke.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Begin to do something now by not plaguing his life out,&quot; 
              said Meg sharply. </p>
            <p>&quot;How do you know I do, Miss?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I can always tell by his face when he goes away. If you have 
              been good, he looks satisfied and walks briskly. If you have plagued 
              him, he's sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted to go back and 
              do his work better.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I like that? So you keep an account of my good and 
              bad marks in Brooke's face, do you? I see him bow and smile as he 
              passes your window, but I didn't know you'd got up a telegraph.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;We haven't. Don't be angry, and oh, don't tell him I said 
              anything! It was only to show that I cared how you get on, and what 
              is said here is said in confidence, you know,&quot; cried Meg, much 
              alarmed at the thought of what might follow from her careless speech. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't tell tales,&quot; replied Laurie, with his `high 
              and mighty' air, as Jo called a certain expression which he occasionally 
              wore. &quot;Only if Brooke is going to be a thermometer, I must 
              mind and have fair weather for him to report.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Please don't be offended. I didn't meant to preach or tell 
              tales or be silly. I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling 
              which you'd be sorry for by-and-by. You are so kind to us, we feel 
              as if you were our brother and say just what we think. Forgive me, 
              I meant it kindly.&quot; And Meg offered her hand with a gesture 
              both affectionate and timid. </p>
            <p>Ashamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind little 
              hand, and said frankly, &quot;I'm the one to be forgiven. I'm cross 
              and have been out of sorts all day. I like to have you tell me my 
              faults and be sisterly, so don't mind if I am grumpy sometimes. 
              I thank you all the same.&quot; </p>
            <p>Bent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as agreeable 
              as possible, wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to please Jo, 
              shook down cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her ferns, proving 
              himself a fit person to belong to the `Busy Bee Society'. In the 
              midst of an animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles 
              (one of those amiable creatures having strolled up from the river), 
              the faint sound of a bell warned them that Hannah had put the tea 
              `to draw', and they would just have time to get home to supper. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;May I come again?&quot; asked Laurie. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, if your are good, and love your book, as the boys in 
              the primer are told to do,&quot; said Meg, smiling. </p>
            <p>&quot;i'll try.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Then you may come, and I'll teach you to knit as the Scotchmen 
              do. There's a demand for socks just now,&quot; added Jo, waving 
              hers like a big blue worsted banner as they parted at the gate. 
            </p>
            <p>That night, when Beth played to Mr. Laurence in the twilight, Laurie, 
              standing in the shadow of the curtain, listened to the little David, 
              whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit, and watched 
              the old man, who sat with his gray head on his hand, thinking tender 
              thoughts of the dead child he had loved so much. Remembering the 
              conversation of the afternoon, the boy said to himself, with the 
              resolve to make the sacrifice cheerfully, &quot;I'll let my castle 
              go, and stay with the dear old gentleman while he needs me, for 
              I am all he has.&quot; </p>

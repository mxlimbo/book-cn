            <p> <br>
              When Jo came home that spring, she had been struck with the change 
              in Beth. No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come 
              too gradually to startle those who saw her daily, but to eyes sharpened 
              by absence, it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on Jo's heart 
              as she saw her sister's face. It was no paler and but littler thinner 
              than in the autumn, yet there was a strange, transparent look about 
              it, as if the mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal 
              shining through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty. 
              Jo saw and felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first 
              impression lost much of its power, for Beth seemed happy, no one 
              appeared to doubt that she was better, and presently in other cares 
              Jo fora time forgot her fear. </p>
            <p>But when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague 
              anxiety returned and haunted her. She had confessed her sins and 
              been forgiven, but when she showed her savings and proposed a mountain 
              trip, Beth had thanked her heartily, but begged not to go so far 
              away from home. Another little visit to the seashore would suit 
              her better, and as Grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave 
              the babies, Jo took Beth down to the quiet place, where she could 
              live much in the open air, and let the fresh sea breezes blow a 
              little color into her pale cheeks. </p>
            <p>It was not a fashionable place, but even among the pleasant people 
              there, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for one another. 
              Beth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too wrapped up in her 
              to care for anyone else. So they were all in all to each other, 
              and came and went, quite unconscious of the interest they exited 
              in those about them, who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong 
              sister and the feeble one, always together, as if they felt instinctively 
              that a long separation was not far away. </p>
            <p>They did feel it, yet neither spoke of it, for often between ourselves 
              and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which 
              it is very hard to overcome. Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between 
              her heart and Beth's, but when she put out her hand to lift it up, 
              there seemed something sacred in the silence, and she waited for 
              Beth to speak. She wondered, and was thankful also, that her parents 
              did not seem to see what she saw, and during the quiet weeks when 
              the shadows grew so plain to her, she said nothing of it to those 
              at home, believing that it would tell itself when Beth came back 
              no better. She wondered still more if her sister really guessed 
              the hard truth, and what thoughts were passing through her mind 
              during the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks with her head 
              in Jo's lap, while the winds blew healthfully over her and the sea 
              made music at her feet. </p>
            <p>One day Beth told her. Jo thought she was asleep, she lay so still, 
              and putting down her book, sat looking at her with wistful eyes, 
              trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on Beth's cheeks. 
              But she could not find enough to satisfy her, for the cheeks were 
              very thin, and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy 
              little shells they had been collecting. It came to her then more 
              bitterly than ever that Beth was slowly drifting away form her, 
              and her arms instinctively tightened their hold upon the dearest 
              treasure she possessed. For a minute her eyes were too dim for seeing, 
              and when they cleared, Beth was looking up at her so tenderly that 
              there was hardly any need for her to say, &quot;Jo, dear, I'm glad 
              you know it. I've tried to tell you, but I couldn't.&quot; </p>
            <p>There was no answer except her sister's cheek against her own, 
              not even tears, for when most deeply moved, Jo did not cry. She 
              was the weaker then, land Beth tried to comfort and sustain her, 
              with her arms about her and the soothing words she whispered in 
              her ear. </p>
            <p>&quot;I've known it for a good while, dear, and now I'm used to 
              it, it isn't hard to think of or to bear. Try to see it so and don't 
              be troubled about me, because it's best, indeed it is.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth? You 
              did not feel it then, land keep it to yourself so long, did you?&quot; 
              asked Jo, refusing to see or say that it was best, but glad to know 
              that Laurie had no part in Beth's trouble. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn't like to own it. 
              I tried to think it was a sick fancy, and would not let it trouble 
              anyone. But when I saw you all so well and strong and full of happy 
              plans, it was hard to feel that I could never be like you, and then 
              I was miserable, Jo.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, Beth, and you didn't tell me, didn't let me comfort and 
              help you? How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo's voice was full of tender reproach, and her heart ached to 
              think of the solitary struggle that must have gone on while Beth 
              learned to say goodbye to health, love, and live, and take up her 
              cross so cheerfully. </p>
            <p>&quot;Perhaps it was wrong, but I tried to do right. I wasn't sure, 
              no one said anything, and I hoped I was mistaken. It would have 
            </p>
            <p>been selfish to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about 
              Meg, and Amy away, and you so happy with Laurie--at least I thought 
              so then.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;And I thought you loved him, Beth, and I went away because 
              I couldn't,&quot; cried Jo, glad to say all the truth. </p>
            <p>Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her 
              pain, and added softly, &quot;Then you didn't, dearie? I was afraid 
              it was so, and imagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity 
              all that while.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you?&quot; asked 
              Beth, as innocently as a child. &quot;I do love him dearly. He is 
              so good to me, how can I help It? But he could never be anything 
              to me but my brother. I hope he truly will be, sometime.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Not through me,&quot; said Jo decidedly. &quot;Amy is left 
              for him, and they would suit excellently, but I have no heart for 
              such things, now. I don't care what becomes of anybody but you, 
              Beth. You must get well.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I want to, oh, so much! I try, but every day I lose a little, 
              and feel more sure that I shall never gain it back. It's like the 
              tide, Jo, when it turns, it goes slowly, but it can't be stopped..&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;It shall be stopped, your tide must not turn so soon, nineteen 
              is too young, Beth. I can't let you go. I'll work and pray and fight 
              against it. I'll keep you in spite of everything. There must be 
              ways, it can't be too late. God won't be so cruel as to take you 
              from me,&quot; cried poor Jo rebelliously, for her spirit was far 
              less piously submissive than Beth's. </p>
            <p>Simple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety. It shows 
              itself in acts rather than in words, and has more influence than 
              homilies or protestations. Beth could not reason upon or explain 
              the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life, and 
              cheerfully wait for death. Like a confiding child, she asked no 
              questions, but left everything to God and nature, Father and Mother 
              of us all, feeling sure that they, and they only, could teach and 
              strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come. 
              She did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only loved her better 
              for her passionate affection, and clung more closely to the dear 
              human love, from which our Father never means us to be weaned, but 
              through which He draws us closer to Himself. She could not say, 
              &quot;I'm glad to go,&quot; for life was very sweet for her. She 
              could only sob out, &quot;I try to be willing,&quot;while she held 
              fast to Jo, as the first bitter wave of this great sorrow broke 
              over them together. </p>
            <p>By and by Beth said, with recovered serenity, &quot;You'll tell 
              them this when we go home?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I think they will see it without words,&quot; sighed Jo, 
              for now it seemed to her that Beth changed every day. </p>
            <p>&quot;Perhaps not. I've heard that the people who love best are 
              often blindest to such things. If they don't see it, you will tell 
              them for me. I don't want any secrets, and it's kinder to prepare 
              them. Meg has John and the babies to comfort her, but you must stand 
              by Father and Mother, won't you Jo?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;If I can. But, Beth, I don't give up yet. I'm going to believe 
              that it is a sick fancy, and not let you think it's true.&quot; 
              said Jo, trying to speak cheerfully. </p>
            <p>Beth lay a minute thinking, and then said in her quiet way, &quot;I 
              don't know how to express myself, and shouldn't try to anyone but 
              you, because I can't speak out except to my Jo. I only mean to say 
              that I have a feeling that it never was intended I should live long. 
              I'm not like the rest of you. I never made any plans about what 
              I'd do when I grew up. I never thought of being married, as you 
              all did. I couldn't seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little 
              Beth, trotting about at home, of no use anywhere but there. I never 
              wanted to go away, and the hard part now is the leaving you all. 
              I'm not afraid, but it seems as if I should be homesick for you 
              even in heaven.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo could not speak, and for several minutes there was no sound 
              but the sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide. A white-winged 
              gull flew by, with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast. 
              Beth watched it till it vanished, and her eyes were full of sadness. 
              A little gray-coated sand bird came tripping over the beach `peeping' 
              softly to itself, as if enjoying the sun and sea. It came quite 
              close to Beth, and looked at her with a friendly eye and sat upon 
              a warm stone, dressing its wet feathers, quite at home. Beth smiled 
              and felt comforted, for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small 
              friendship and remind her that a pleasant world was still to be 
              enjoyed. </p>
            <p>&quot;Dear little bird! See, Jo, how tame it is. I like peeps better 
              than the gulls. They are not so wild and handsome, but they seem 
              happy, confiding little things. I used to call them my birds last 
              summer, and Mother said they reminded her of me --busy, quaker-colored 
              creatures, always near the shore, and always chirping that contented 
              little song of theirs. You are the gull, Jo, strong and wild, fond 
              of the storm and the wind, flying far out to sea, and happy all 
              alone. Meg is the turtledove, and Amy is like the lark she write 
              about, trying to get up among the clouds, but always dropping down 
              into its nest again. Dear little girl! She's so ambitious, but her 
              heart is good and tender, and no matter how high she flies, she 
              never will forget home. I hope I shall see her again, but she seems 
              so far away.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;She is coming in the spring, and I mean that you shall be 
              all ready to see and enjoy her. I'm going to have you well and rosy 
              by that time.&quot; began Jo, feeling that of all the changes in 
              Beth, the talking change was the greatest, for it seemed to cost 
              no effort now, and she thought aloud in a way quite unlike bashful 
              Beth. </p>
            <p>&quot;Jo, dear, don't hope any more. It won't do any good. I'm 
              sure of that. We won't be miserable, but enjoy being together while 
              we wait. We'll have happy times, for I don't suffer much, and I 
              think the tide will go out easily, if you help me.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face, and with that silent 
              kiss, she dedicated herself soul and body to Beth. </p>
            <p>She was right. There was no need of any words when they got home, 
              for Father and Mother saw plainly now what they had prayed to be 
              saved from seeing. Tired with her short journey, Beth went at once 
              to bed, saying how glad she was to be home, and when Jo went down, 
              she found that she would be spared the hard task of telling Beth's 
              secret. Her father stood leaning his head on the mantelpiece and 
              did not turn as she came in, but her mother stretched out her arms 
              as if for help, and Jo went to comfort her without a word. </p>

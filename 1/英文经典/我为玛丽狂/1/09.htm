                EXT. THE HOT CLUB - DAY</p>
              <p>Ted and Dom are having a beer and a dog.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about 
                anything again. Life is too fucking short. </p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Hey, look on the bright side--</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (interrupting)<br>
                What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Well...at least now you know.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring 
                to know there was someone so pure in the world.</p>
              <p>As Ted dwells on this, Dom bursts out LAUGHING.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                What's so funny?</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't 
                you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've 
                been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, 
                and it turns<br>
                out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing 
                that ever happened to you! </p>
              <p>Ted flinches at this.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Wait a second, I never told you that.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away. </p>
              <p>Ted thinks it over.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, 
                I've still got my health...<br>
                (checks watch)<br>
                I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's 
                brother into his apartment.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Never met him.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit 
                that stupid magazine.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Amen to that.</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>EXT. MIAMI - DRIVING RANGE - DAY</p>
              <p>Healy pays for a bucket of balls, then takes his clubs and strolls<br>
                jauntily to...</p>
              <p>A GOLF TEE NEXT TO MARY'S</p>
              <p>Healy places a ball on the tee and takes a swing. He tops the 
                ball<br>
                and it dribbles about ten yards.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Hit a house! Bite bite!<br>
                (to Mary)<br>
                Haven't swung the wrenches in a while.</p>
              <p>Mary nods. Healy takes another swing and duck-hooks one about 
                fifty yards. Mary addresses her ball, takes a smooth backswing,and</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                Hey, can you give me some tips here?</p>
              <p>She cracks her shot long and straight.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Thanks.</p>
              <p>Mary tees up another ball and Healy puts down his club.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd) <br>
                I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (annoyed)<br>
                No thanks.</p>
              <p>Healy pulls out a huge wad of change from his pocket.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar?<br>
                All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (interested)<br>
                Nepal? Have you been?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                You own a home there?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Well...it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains 
                are so tall you can't see the tops?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's 
                been my experience anyway.</p>
              <p>She looks impressed. Healy looks at his watch. </p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                You know, I should just get going. I'll work on my game next week.</p>
              <p>He flips her a coin.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                Thanks.</p>
              <p>Healy starts to walk off. Mary doesn't know what to do. Will 
                she<br>
                ever see this guy again?</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                (CALLS after him)<br>
                It was nice meeting you!</p>
              <p>Healy doesn't answer or turn around. He just raises his hand 
                and<br>
                gives her a little wave.</p>
              <p>Mary shrugs her shoulders. Oh well...</p>
              <p>EXT. DRIVING RANGE PARKING LOT - DAY</p>
              <p>Healy is sitting in Sully's Chrysler LeBaron, right next to Mary's<br>
                Honda Civic.</p>
              <p>He watches the rear-view mirror, and the moment he sees Mary<br>
                coming out from the driving range, he swings his legs out the 
                door and starts changing out of his golf shoes. As Mary tosses 
                her golf bag into the trunk, she notices Healy tying his shoes. 
                A<br>
                second chance.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Well, it was nice meeting you, again.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Same here again.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                By the way, what's your name?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Pat Healy.</p>
              <p>There's an uncomfortable pause...Why doesn't this guy ask the<br>
                usual questions?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Don't you want to know my name?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                I already know it, Mary.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (surprised)<br>
                How'd you know that?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                It's right there on your golf bag.</p>
              <p>Healy opens the back door to put away his golf shoes. Suddenly,<br>
                rolls and rolls of paper come tumbling out. Mary bends over to<br>
                help Healy pick them up.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                What are you doing with all these blueprints?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Some buildings I'm working on.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Are you...an architect?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.</p>
              <p>Mary stares at him, mouth agape.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect--it's 
                just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is 
                my hobby.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                What's that?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                I work with retards.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (taken aback)<br>
                I beg your pardon?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                You know...<br>
                (flaps lips with fingers)<br>
                ...the guys who ride the short bus.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (put off)<br>
                Isn't that a little politically incorrect?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't 
                work with.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                No, I mean</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                --There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a 
                mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and--</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                --He's in a cage?! </p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Well it's more of an enclosure really.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                They keep him confined? That's bullshit!</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, 
                one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty 
                of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can 
                take him to ball games, movies--you know, happy stuff.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                That sounds like fun.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.<br>
                (getting emotional)<br>
                Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this 
                crazy old world. (checks watch)<br>
                Ooh, hey, I gotta run.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (won back over)<br>
                Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.</p>
              <p>Healy smiles at this and we</p>

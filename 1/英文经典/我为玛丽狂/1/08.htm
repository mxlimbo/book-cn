                EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Healy sits out front in his car again waiting for Mary to get<br>
                home. He picks up the phone, dials a number, and someone answers 
                but doesn't speak.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Hello...? Sully...?<br>
                (beat)<br>
                Sully, that you?</p>
              <p> SULLY (V.O.)<br>
                (over phone)<br>
                Who the fuck is it to you?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?</p>
              <p>INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Sully is sitting on the kitchen floor in his police uniform, 
                a<br>
                ring of white around his nostrils. The room is littered with beer<br>
                cans, he has another one in his hand, there's a pile of cocaine<br>
                and a rolled-up bill on the breakfast table. The dog and the snake<br>
                are in the doorway looking at him with concern.</p>
              <p> SULLY<br>
                (into phone, sloshed)<br>
                Fuckin' Patrick Healy, you think your shit don't stink. Well I 
                got news for you--you're goddamn right it don't! How the hell 
                are ya?!</p>
              <p>INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Healy looks at the phone, concerned.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back 
                in a couple hours,I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.</p>
              <p> SULLY (V.O.)<br>
                You found my car?!</p>
              <p>Just then Healy notices Mary pull up and park. He slides down 
                in<br>
                his seat.</p>
              <p>ON MARY - she gets out carrying a bag and approaches the<br>
                Homeless Man, who is still sitting on the sidewalk. She hands 
                him<br>
                the bag.</p>
              <p> HOMELESS MAN<br>
                Thanks, Mary.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                You watch out for yourself, Herb.</p>
              <p>As Mary bounds up the steps of her building, we</p>
              <p>HOLD ON the Homeless Man as he happily takes a sandwich and soda 
                out of the bag.</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
              <p>As Mary rushes into the apartment, Magda is glued to her radio<br>
                scanner, listening intently.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this--some cop's staking out this 
                broad's apartment.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                No time, Magda, my show's starting.</p>
              <p>BACK ON HEALY...</p>
              <p>... he can hear the conversation through the SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT<br>
                pointed at Mary's place.</p>
              <p> MAGDA (V.O.)<br>
                This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed 
                up.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (quietly into phone)<br>
                Call you back.</p>
              <p> SULLY<br>
                (over phone)<br>
                God, I miss ya, ya fuck-</p>
              <p>Healy hangs up abruptly.</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Ah, Christ, I lost 'em.</p>
              <p>Mary runs into her bedroom, shuts the door and flips on the tube<br>
                just as ESPN Sportscenter's OPENING THEME SONG is playing.<br>
                Relieved, Mary lays back on her bed and starts watching.</p>
              <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Mary is now watching Andy Griffith while SMOKING A JOINT and 
                GIGGLING away in bed.</p>
              <p>ON HEALY - he's sitting in his car, GIGGLING, too.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Fucking Barney...he never learns...</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT</p>
              <p>As the show's end credits start to WHISTLE AWAY, Mary stands 
                and starts to UNDRESS for bed.</p>
              <p>BACK ON HEALY - he sits up, very interested now.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (into mic)<br>
                Here we go, Teddo. Here comes the money<br>
                shot.</p>
              <p>Healy quickly reaches in the back seat and pulls out a bigger,<br>
                MORE POWERFUL PAIR OF BINOCULARS.</p>
              <p>HEALY'S BINOCULAR POV - we're CLOSE ON the wrinkliest, saggiest, 
                droopiest set of milkbags on the planet.</p>
              <p>ON HEALY - he cringes.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                Oooof. First chink in the armor, Teddy<br>
                Boy....</p>
              <p>HEALY'S BINOCULAR POV - He moves his view up from the tits to 
                reveal...MAGDA UNDRESSING for bed.</p>
              <p>ON HEALY - He flinches, sickened by his mistake, then<br>
                repositions the binoculars dead left to the next window.</p>
              <p>HEALY'S BINOCULAR POV - moving over to the next window we see...<br>
                Mary as she just finishes putting on some sexy t-shirt.</p>
              <p>ON HEALY - as he starts to drool.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                Oh sweet Jesus</p>
              <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
              <p>EXT. PROVIDENCE - THE HOT CLUB - DAY</p>
              <p>Ted is sitting alone having a beer when a smiling Healy<br>
                approaches.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                I've got some very, very good news for you,<br>
                my friend.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Really?<br>
                (perking up)<br>
                Very, very?</p>
              <p>Healy sits down and motions for a beer.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                I think your life's about to change.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                So you found Mary?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really 
                something.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                So she hasn't changed?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                That I couldn't. say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little 
                big-boned in high school?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                No, not at all.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.</p>
              <p>This doesn't dampen Ted's enthusiasm.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Mary's a little chubby, huh?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half.<br>
                Not bad.</p>
              <p>Ted's smile starts to fade.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids,<br>
                you're going to put on a few pounds.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                So she's married?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Nope. Never been.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Huh?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Four kids, three different guys.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Three different guys?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Oh my.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, 
                I bet.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                She's in a wheelchair?!</p>
              <p>Ted looks completely drained.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed 
                a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (shrugs)<br>
                It's just that...Mary. I wouldn't have thought...</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. 
                Got it from her bookie--nice guy. You should definitely call her, 
                Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined 
                to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she 
                does it.</p>
              <p>Ted stands and starts moping away.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Thanks, Healy. Good work.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Uh, that's okay.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before 
                her mastectomy!</p>
              <p>As Ted leaves, Healy puts his feet up on the table and sits back.</p>
              <p>INT. TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
              <p>We PAN across the room of unopened boxes to Ted laying awake 
                in bed. We hear HEAD-BANGER MUSIC coming from the apartment next 
                door. Finally Ted gets up and walks over to his dresser. As he 
                flips on a small light we see loose change, a balled-up Kleenex, 
                a few golf tees, and Ted's wallet. Ted picks up the wallet and 
                opens it.</p>
              <p>TED'S POV - Inside is an an old high school photo of a smiling<br>
                Mary.</p>
              <p>As Ted looks at it, he can't help but smile, too.</p>
              <p>INT. PROVIDENCE UNION INSURANCE COMPANY - DAY</p>
              <p>ON HEALY'S CUBICLE - Healy's taking his last boxload of crap 
                out of his cubicle when he spots Ted. He tries to duck back in 
                but Ted sees him. Healy forces a smile as Ted approaches.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                What are you doing?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Oh, uh, I resigned.</p>
              <p>Ted picks up a plane ticket off the desk.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Miami?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to 
                go down and try my hand at jai alai.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Jai alai?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.</p>
              <p>Healy starts walking out of the office and Ted follows. Healy 
                is<br>
                having a hard time looking him in the eye. So he doesn't.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me. </p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Good good.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Well I think you're right, I should look her up.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Rollerpig? Are you nuts?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                But you said she was a sparkplug...?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                I said buttplug. She's heinous.</p>
              <p>Ted SIGHS and follows Healy out the front door.</p>
              <p>EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY</p>
              <p>They walk across the lot toward Healy's car.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy--Mary 
                sure has a lot of troubles in her life--but, I don't know,maybe 
                I can help her out.<br>
                (sighs)<br>
                The poor thing's had it tough--she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Oh. I thought<br>
                (beat)<br>
                That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, 
                but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something 
                for her.</p>
              <p>Healy comes to his car and puts his stuff in the trunk.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon 
                as she gets back from Japan.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Japan? What's she doing in Japan?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.</p>
              <p>Ted is devastated. </p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Mary's a mail-order bride?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget,<br>
                it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like 
                tuna.</p>
              <p>Off Ted's look, we</p>

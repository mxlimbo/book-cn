                EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY</p>
              <p>Ted comes out followed by a beaming Warren dressed in the Super-Hero 
                outfit. They continue walking again and a few steps later Warren 
                excitedly points to another shop window.</p>
              <p>THEIR POV</p>
              <p>In the window is a mannequin dressed in a cowboy outfit, i.e. 
                Lone Ranger (hat, badge, holster, chaps, vest, boots, spurs, etc.)</p>
              <p>Again, Warren pulls Ted into the store.</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY</p>
              <p>Mary is window shopping with a few bags in hand. She turns and 
                reacts amused.</p>
              <p>HER POV</p>
              <p>Warren is now dressed in the cowboy outfit and a humiliated Ted 
                follows dressed in the loose fitting Super-hero outfit.</p>
              <p>EXT. SCENIC PIER - MIAMI - DAY</p>
              <p>--Ted and Mary are walking arm and arm on a SCENIC PIER<br>
                where PEOPLE ARE FISHING. Right behind them are Magda<br>
                and Herb (the Homeless guy) enjoying one another's company. Ted 
                is on top of the world, feeling good, looking good-right up until 
                he gets the HOOK IN HIS MOUTH. Suddenly he gets YANKED OUT OF 
                FRAME.</p>
              <p>EXT. SCENIC PIER - MIAMI - DAY</p>
              <p>--Ted is FLOPPING AROUND on the pavement and a FISHERMAN has 
                his FOOT ON HIS FACE as he STRUGGLES TO REMOVE THE HOOK. Mary 
                looks on, concerned.</p>
              <p>EXT. GROCERY STORE - MIAMI - DAY</p>
              <p>--Ted and Mary come out of the grocery store each<br>
                HOLDING A COUPLE BAGS. Ted also is CARRYING PUFFY, IN A BODYCAST. 
                Ted PUTS PUFFY ON THE ROOF, then starts putting the groceries 
                in the back seat.</p>
              <p>EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
              <p>--Mary pulls her car up in front of her apartment. AS Ted gets 
                out of the passenger's side, he notices that PUFFY IS STILL ON 
                THE ROOF. He quickly GRABS PUFFY before Mary notices.</p>
              <p>EXT. BATTING CAGE - MIAMI - DAY</p>
              <p>--Warren is futilely taking swings in a BATTING CAGE<br>
                while Mary looks on helplessly. Finally Ted goes into<br>
                the cage, SIGNALS THE GUY TO STOP THE PITCHING MACHINE,<br>
                and MOVES WARREN A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE PLATE.</p>
              <p>--A distraught Ted SITS SOMBERLY on a bench. Beside him, Mary<br>
                comforts Warren whose LEFT EYE IS BLACK AND BLUE AND COMPLETELY<br>
                CLOSED.</p>
              <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
              <p>Ted shows up at Mary's apartment door carrying a BOUQUET OF<br>
                FLOWERS and a BASEBALL. When he KNOCKS, the door opens.</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>Ted peeks around the corner and sees a SOMBER Mary sitting on 
                the<br>
                couch.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (chipper)<br>
                Hey.</p>
              <p>Mary doesn't look up. Ted ENTERS, revealing his gifts.</p>
              <p> TED (cont'd)<br>
                The flowers are for you and the ball's for<br>
                Warren. I had a friend of mine Fedex it to<br>
                me--it's signed by Tony Conigliaro.</p>
              <p>Mary finally looks up but doesn't smile.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Did you hire Pat Healy to follow me around?</p>
              <p>Ted tries to hide his horror.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (lamely)<br>
                What do you mean?</p>
              <p>Mary picks up a letter off the coffee table and hands it to him.<br>
                Ted takes a quick look and then drops it on the table.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                It's not true...right, Ted?</p>
              <p>Ted CLEARS HIS THROAT.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Well, funny story there. You see, uh, it<br>
                started out as a uh...yeah...it's true. =</p>
              <p>Mary stands up.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Get out.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Wait, hold on, Mary--it's not as bad as it<br>
                sounds. I certainly didn't know--</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                That you put a murderer on my trail?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I<br>
                just thought--</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                What did you think, Ted? That you could spy<br>
                on me and trick me into thinking you were<br>
                someone I could...really go for?</p>
              <p>Mary starts to get emotional.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Then what the fuck did you do it for?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you 
                and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good<br>
                again.</p>
              <p>Mary looks away.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (softly)<br>
                Please leave.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (devastated)<br>
                Mary, come on...</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Go!</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (beat)<br>
                Okay.</p>
              <p>And so Ted does.</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY</p>
              <p>Ted comes out of the building, a broken man. He paces back and<br>
                forth on the sidewalk, manic with despair. Then he seems to grow 
                angry. He rifles through his pockets until he finds a SLIP OF 
                PAPER.</p>
              <p>TED'S POV - the paper reads: 'Healy's Miami address--229 Court 
                Street, apt. 43.'</p>
              <p>INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY</p>
              <p>Ted walks down a rather dark hallway until he comes to apartment 
                43. He KNOCKS on the door but no one answers. He tries the handle 
                and THE DOOR OPENS.</p>
              <p>INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS </p>
              <p>Ted ENTERS and immediately reacts to the STENCH.</p>
              <p>REVERSE ANGLE reveals that the place is a fucking PIG-STY. DOG 
                SHIT is everywhere, FLIES fill the room, a MOUSE scampers across 
                the carpet.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Hello...?</p>
              <p>No answer. Suddenly he HEARS SOMEONE out in the hall, so he ducks 
                behind the door.</p>
              <p>Healy and Tucker ENTER the apartment and stop in their tracks 
                when they see the MESS.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Ho-ly shit.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Hey, this is a pretty nice place.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!</p>
              <p>Again, no answer. Suddenly Ted SLAMS THE DOOR shut and grabs 
                Healy by the collar.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                (alarmed)<br>
                Hey, hey, hey!</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Surprised?</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Hey, buddy, don't do anything rash now.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (to Tucker)<br>
                Who the fuck are you?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                He's in love with Mary, too.</p>
              <p>Ted releases Healy and glares at him.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (righteous)<br>
                What do you mean 'why'?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Answer the question, shitball.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                I think everybody could use a drink.</p>
              <p>Tucker goes into the kitchen.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I 
                started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good 
                conscience do it.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (amazed)<br>
                Do what?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Turn her over to a stalker.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                What?! You're calling me a stalker?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                That's right--if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!</p>
              <p>Suddenly they hear a SOUND and turn to see Bill the Boa slithering 
                into the room with A HUGE, GREAT-DANE-SIZE LUMP in his midsection.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                (sickened)<br>
                Oh Christ...poor dog.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                You're a sick man, you know that?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was 
                my turn.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Your turn?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (getting emotional)<br>
                That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? 
                Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the 
                B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more--it 
                was my turn. It was time for me...time for me...to be happy.</p>
              <p>This is so pathetic that it actually gets to Ted. He sits down,<br>
                runs his fingers through his hair.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, 
                just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me 
                down with you?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I'm talking about the letter, asshole.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                What? </p>
              <p>Ted stares at him.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our 
                deal?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.</p>
              <p>The guys stare at one another, then Tucker comes out the kitchen<br>
                with a drink. They turn their attention to him.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                You little fuck.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                What?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                You fucking prick, we had a deal--you said you wouldn't fuck me 
                and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking 
                picture.<br>
                (moves in on Tucker)<br>
                You crossed the line, man.</p>
              <p>Tucker backs away nervously. </p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Whoa, whoa, you're getting crazy now. Why would I cross the line--what 
                do you think I got no pride?</p>
              <p>Healy grabs Tucker by the neck.</p>
              <p> TUCKER (cont'd)<br>
                I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, 
                you piece of shit.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting 
                is blowing farts in the chick's face</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                You were following us?</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Don't flatter yourself--I was following her, I always do. How 
                the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?</p>
              <p>This gets Ted's attention.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                You mean...Steve didn't say all that stuff about Warren?</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Are you shitting me--Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes?<br>
                He was like a fucking eagle scout. You two should be kissing my 
                balls--if it wasn't for me, she might've married that schmuck!</p>
              <p>Ted thinks about this.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                The hell with you both--I'm out of here.</p>
              <p>Ted walks out the door leaving Healy and Tucker to stare each<br>
                other down. Just then Hal the Great Dane walks out of the bedroom 
                with a CEREAL BOX stuck on his head. Healy does a double-take, 
                then looks back at the snake.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (sadly)<br>
                Oh...Sully.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who 
                sent it?</p>

                ON BUSTY GIRL - The Ear-Muff Guy marches up to her and her boyfriend.</p>
              <p> EAR-MUFF GUY<br>
                You seen my pecker?</p>
              <p> GIRL<br>
                What?!</p>
              <p> EAR-MUFF GUY<br>
                You seen my pecker?</p>
              <p>The Boyfriend grabs him by the collar.</p>
              <p> BOYFRIEND<br>
                You son-of-a-bitch, I'll kick your ass!</p>
              <p>The Boyfriend throws the Ear-Muff Guy to the ground and is about 
                to pummel him when Ted intervenes.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Take it easy, Smokey.</p>
              <p> BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY<br>
                This fucking pervert just came on to Nance!</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                All right, just be cool.<br>
                (under breath)<br>
                He looks like he's not all there, you know<br>
                what I mean?</p>
              <p>A crowd starts to gather which only incites Smokey more.</p>
              <p> BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY<br>
                Get the fuck out of my way, man!</p>
              <p>Smokey tosses Ted out of the way and moves toward the Ear-Muff<br>
                Guy. Just then Mary shows up and steps between them.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                What's going on here?</p>
              <p>She bends down and helps the Ear-Muff Guy off the ground.</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                Are you all right?</p>
              <p> EAR-MUFF GUY<br>
                Mary, you seen my baseball?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                No, I haven't seen your baseball. Jeez,Warren, you know you're 
                not supposed to leave the yard by yourself.</p>
              <p> BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY<br>
                (to Mary)<br>
                You know him?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                He's my brother.</p>
              <p> BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY<br>
                Oh.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                I didn't realize he was...you know...</p>
              <p>At this, Smokey and his girlfriend reluctantly head toward the<br>
                school, along with most of the crowd.</p>
              <p>Mary turns her attention in the direction Ted was thrown.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                You okay?</p>
              <p>HER POV - Ted is sitting in a mud puddle. He stands and brushes 
                himself off.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Oh yeah. Fine.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Thanks a lot, Ted.</p>
              <p>CLOSE ON - Ted. He can't believe what he's just heard. As Mary 
                helps him up, she turns her attention to Warren.</p>
              <p> MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)<br>
                That she knew my name blew my mind. Some of my best friends didn't 
                know my name.</p>
              <p>EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING</p>
              <p>Mary and a muddied Ted are walking Warren home. Warren lags<br>
                behind, mumbling to himself. Mary notices that Ted is limping.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                No, it's an old football injury.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Oh, are you on the team?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, 
                I fell off the school.</p>
              <p>Warren approaches and motions for Ted to hop on his back.</p>
              <p> WARREN<br>
                Piggyback ride?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Warren, come on, leave Ted alone.</p>
              <p>Warren pats his back again.</p>
              <p> WARREN<br>
                Piggyback ride.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (to Mary)<br>
                I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Oh he can hold you. He weighs two-hundred-and-thirty pounds.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?</p>
              <p>Ted hops onto Warren's back.</p>
              <p> TED (cont'd)<br>
                Giddy-up.</p>
              <p>Warren walks about five feet and stops.</p>
              <p> WARREN<br>
                My turn now.</p>
              <p>Off Ted's reaction, we</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>

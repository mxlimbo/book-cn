              <p>EXT. CUMBERLAND, RHODE ISLAND HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING</p>
              <p>It's the early 1980's and everyone is arriving at school. We 
                push<br>
                through the parking lot crowd to a nervous, lanky kid, TED<br>
                PELOQUIN.</p>
              <p> MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)<br>
                When I was sixteen years old I fell in<br>
                love...</p>
              <p>CLOSE ON - RENISE, a tough girl with stringy brown hair and a<br>
                shiny forehead, as she turns toward the camera.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Hey, Renise.</p>
              <p>She barely looks at him as he approaches, just drags on her smoke.</p>
              <p> RENISE<br>
                Hey.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                So what's up?</p>
              <p> RENISE<br>
                Eh.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Great. Great.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you<br>
                wanted to go to the prom you know, with<br>
                me.</p>
              <p>Renise looks unenthused.</p>
              <p> TED (cont'd)<br>
                It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you<br>
                want.</p>
              <p> RENISE<br>
                See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that<br>
                this guy I like was gonna ask me.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Uh-huh.</p>
              <p> RENISE<br>
                Yeah, so...I'm gonna wait and see what<br>
                happens there...But that sounds great,<br>
                yeah.</p>
              <p>Ted nods, confused.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Okay.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                So is that a yes or a no?</p>
              <p> RENISE<br>
                I think I was very clear, Ted. If<br>
                everything else falls apart, maybe.</p>
              <p>Renise throws down her butt and storms off.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I'm gonna hold you to that.</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT</p>
              <p>ANGLE ON - a pretty girl, MARY, climbing off a ten-speed in the<br>
                school parking lot. She's athletic and tanned and doesn't have 
                a<br>
                bad bone in her body.</p>
              <p> MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)<br>
                Her name was Mary. She'd moved to our<br>
                little Rhode Island town from Minnesota two<br>
                years earlier.</p>
              <p>She locks up the bike and starts walking toward the school.</p>
              <p> MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)<br>
                Mary was very smart, and very cool, and she<br>
                had a faceful of eyes that promised you a<br>
                better life if you could only know her.</p>
              <p>As she approaches the camera, we PAN to see Ted watching her. 
                He's<br>
                sitting on a picnic table with two FRIENDS.</p>
              <p> FRIEND #1<br>
                Hey, dirtbud, who you going to the prom<br>
                with?</p>
              <p>Finally Ted takes his eyes off Mary.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Ah, I don't know if I'm even gonna. You<br>
                know, not my style.</p>
              <p> FRIEND #2<br>
                You have a style?</p>
              <p> FRIEND #1<br>
                Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (perks up)<br>
                Who?</p>
              <p>Friend #1 makes a jerk-off motion.</p>
              <p> FRIEND #1<br>
                Rosey Palm, your girlfriend. God knows you<br>
                spend enough fucking time with her.</p>
              <p>The guys LAUGH.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (out of ammo but doesn't<br>
                know it)<br>
                Yeah, and who are you gonna take, your own<br>
                palm?</p>
              <p>His friends stare at him.</p>
              <p> FRIEND #1<br>
                Clever. I like the way you just spun that<br>
                around on me.</p>
              <p>Friend #2 notices Mary talking to her FRIENDS.</p>
              <p> FRIEND #2<br>
                I wonder who she's going with.</p>
              <p> FRIEND #1<br>
                Some guy named Woogie.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Who?</p>
              <p> FRIEND #1<br>
                Big guy--goes to Barrington high school.</p>
              <p>This irks Ted.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like<br>
                a loser.</p>
              <p> FRIEND #1<br>
                Loser? Woogie was all-state football and<br>
                and basketball and valedictorian of his<br>
                class.</p>
              <p> FRIEND #2<br>
                I heard he got a scholarship to Princeton<br>
                but he's going to Europe first to model.</p>
              <p>This takes the wind out of Ted's sails.</p>
              <p> FRIEND #3<br>
                Yeah and he's got a huge cock.</p>
              <p>Everyone looks at him.</p>
              <p> FRIEND #3 (cont'd)<br>
                I heard.</p>
              <p>Suddenly Friend #1 NOTICES something.</p>
              <p> FRIEND #1<br>

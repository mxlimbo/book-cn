              <p>Tucker comes out the front door, looks around, then walks off 
                down the sidewalk.</p>
              <p>ANGLE ACROSS THE STREET - on Healy, his steely gaze fixed on 
                Tucker.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (under breath)<br>
                You're gonna pay, fucker.</p>
              <p>Healy discreetly pulls out and slowly follows Tucker in his car.</p>
              <p>BACK ON TUCKER - He continues down the sidewalk, looking back 
                once or twice, apprehensive. He rounds a corner, then stops next 
                to an OLD FORD PINTO. He looks around nervously again. Then Tucker 
                DUCKS INTO THE DRIVER'S SEAT and DRIVES OFF. Healy pulls into 
                traffic and follows.</p>

              <p>INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT </p>
              <p>Dom's mixing a drink while Ted paces nervously.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, 
                man.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (pats his back pocket)<br>
                Got cash.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Car clean? Plenty of gas?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Check.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Mints?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.</p>
              <p>Dom nods, satisfied.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's 
                a go.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Hm?</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                You know, clean the pipes.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Pipes? What are you talking about?</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                You jerk off before all big dates, right?<br>
                Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.</p>
              <p>Ted just stares at him.</p>
              <p> DOM (cont'd)<br>
                (incredulous)<br>
                You don't jerk off before--?! Are you crazy?! That's like going 
                out there with a loaded gun. No wonder you're nervous!</p>
              <p>Ted considers this.</p>
              <p> DOM (cont'd)<br>
                Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of 
                you are laying in bed, are you nervous?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                No.</p>
              <p>Dom shrugs...Duh.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Why's that?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I'm usually too tired to be.</p>
              <p>Dom makes a game-show BUZZER sound.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain 
                any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (starting to believe)<br>
                Huh.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after 
                he's blown a load.<br>
                That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying 
                to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Jesus Christ you're right.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, 
                you empty the barrels!</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (shakes his head)<br>
                Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                People get hurt that way.</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>EXT. HOTEL - EVENING</p>
              <p>Dom walks out of the lobby just as another cab arrives and Mary<br>
                gets out. He sees and her and ducks behind a bush as she walks<br>
                past him.</p>
              <p>INT. TED'S HOTEL BATHROOM - SAME</p>
              <p>Ted has a newspaper splayed out on the counter (open to the bra<br>
                ads) as he furiously FLOGS THE DOLPHIN (chest-high side view.) 
                We see some balled-up tissue nearby. After several frantic strokes, 
                he takes a deep breath and slowly and loudly EXHALES, clearly 
                having COMPLETED HIS MISSION.</p>
              <p>He draws a few more breaths, picks up a face cloth, and goes 
                to<br>
                clean up.</p>
              <p>But something's missing: The Load. Ted looks down, checks his<br>
                hands, pants, shoes, looks in the sink, finally glances at the 
                ceiling, with no luck.</p>
              <p>The Load IS MISSING!!!!</p>
              <p>That's when the doorbell RINGS. Ted couldn't look more HORRIFIED.<br>
                As he buckles his pants, he makes a last, panicky reconnaissance<br>
                of the area. The doorbell RINGS AGAIN and Ted reluctantly goes 
                to answer it.</p>
              <p>INT. TED'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME</p>
              <p>Ted opens the door and Mary is standing there looking as lovely 
                as ever.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Hey.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Hi, Ted.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                You look great.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Thanks.</p>
              <p>She notices something.</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                What's that?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Hm?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                On your ear, you've got something.</p>
              <p>MARY'S POV - a HUGE LOAD is hanging off of Ted's earlobe like 
                a drop earring.</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                It looks like a gob of...</p>
              <p>Mary leans forward for a closer look. Ted is terrified.</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                (making face)<br>
                Is that....hair gel?</p>
              <p>BEAT.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Sure.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Oh great, I ran out.</p>
              <p>Before Ted can stop her, Mary grabs The Load off his ear and 
                WIPES IT IN HER BANGS.</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Healy is still following Tucker in his car. Finally Tucker stops<br>
                in front of a lavish Victorian home and gets out carrying a pizza<br>
                and wearing a PIZZA DELIVERY HAT.</p>
              <p>Healy SCREECHES to a sideways stop, jumps out and POUNCES ON 
                HIM.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                You motherfucker, you're a dead man!</p>
              <p>Tucker drops the pizza as Healy SLAMS HIM into a tree.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                (cowering)<br>
                Okay, Pat, take it easy--don't do anything stupid.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about 
                me?!</p>
              <p>Healy SLAMS HIM AGAINST THE TREE AGAIN.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Whoa, whoa--I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Maybe this'll jog your memory.</p>
              <p>Healy SLAPS him across the face.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                I'll give you a hint--it's got something to do with me being a 
                murderer.</p>
              <p>Healy raises his arm again and Tucker tries to shield himself.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Okay, okay, I might've gotten some bad information.</p>
              <p>Healy grabs him by the collar.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't 
                you, you little shit?</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Who?</p>
              <p>Healy throws Tucker to the ground and takes off his sport coat.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                This is your last chance, you fuck. Now either you come clean 
                or I'm going to kick your ass from here to Tallahassee.</p>
              <p>Healy grabs Tucker by the hair and cocks his arm.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                I LOVE HER, OKAY?!</p>
              <p>Tucker suddenly gets emotional. Healy stops and looks at him.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                You what?</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                You heard me, goddamnit. I...I love her.</p>
              <p>Healy slowly lets go.</p>
              <p> TUCKER (cont'd)<br>
                I'm a phony--just like you, man.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                What do you mean?</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz--who's 
                been to Santiago twice in a year?<br>
                (scoffing)<br>
                Estadio Olimpico--please!</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                But...but you knew people at Harvard.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and 
                I made up everything else.<br>
                (sighs)<br>
                My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Bullshit!</p>
              <p>Tucker rolls his eyes and pulls out his PIZZA DELIVERY BADGE, 
                with him pictured beside the name Norman Plante. As Healy let's

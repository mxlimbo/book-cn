                EXT. MIAMI MUSEUM - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Healy looks slightly disoriented as Mary leads the way into the<br>
                courtyard area by the main building.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                The museum? I thought we were going out to<br>
                dinner?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                We will, but first I have a surprise.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                A surprise?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. 
                He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.</p>
              <p>CLOSE ON HEALY'S FACE as he starts to panic.</p>
              <p>INT. ARCHITECTURE EXHIBIT</p>
              <p>Mary and Healy walk through the exhibit area. Mary scans the 
                room for her friend. Healy's face is ashen.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                I know he's around here someplace.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (chipper)<br>
                What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?</p>
              <p>Mary points to an architectural model.</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                Is this one art deco or art nouveau?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Deco.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                That...? Vestibule.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                How about--?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with 
                the pieces--look at the building in its totalitarianism.</p>
              <p>Mary gives him a look. Suddenly, Healy draws a couple of invisible 
                sixshooters at her.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                Stone crab time! Come on, let's get outta here, goofy.</p>
              <p>He turns to go but Mary notices something O.S.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Tucker!</p>
              <p>Mary leads Healy over to her friend TUCKER, a<br>
                distinguished-looking man in his fifties. Healy looks like a dog<br>
                that's being dragged to the vet. Mary and Tucker embrace.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                (still hugging)<br>
                Come on, like you mean it.</p>
              <p>Mary LAUGHS and hugs Tucker tighter. Then:</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Tucker, this is my friend Pat Healy.<br>
                Healy and Tucker shake hands.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Same here.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Pat's an architect, too.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (keeping cool)<br>
                Mainly I work out of Boston. </p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Harvard?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                You bet.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                (pleased)<br>
                Did you study under Kim Greene?</p>
              <p> HEALY <br>
                Among others.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Kim and I are close friends!</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                You mean him.</p>
              <p>BEAT.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Well...that's debatable.</p>
              <p>Healy makes a hand-gesture to imply that Kim's sexuality is in<br>
                doubt.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Really? But he's been married for twenty years--they've got six 
                kids.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Nice smokescreen, isn't it?</p>
              <p>Tucker can hardly believe his ears.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Pat does projects all over the world.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                (impressed)<br>
                Where would I have seen your work?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Have you been to<br>
                (thinking hard)<br>
                Let's see--Santiago, Chile?</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Absolutely! I was there twice last year.<br>
                Which building is yours?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Do you know the...soccer stadium?</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Did you build the Estadio Olympico?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                No...just down the street, the Amigo Tower.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Uh, sort of nouveau deco...with a big vestibule. Check it out 
                next time you're up there.</p>
              <p>Tucker starts to look a little suspicious.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                You know, I really should take your card.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (noticing something)<br>
                Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?</p>
              <p>Healy drags Mary across the room toward a MAN who's looking at 
                an exhibit.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (to Man)<br>
                Dooby, you old sheep-fucker! How the hell are ya?</p>
              <p> MAN<br>
                My name's Mel.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Oh, sorry. Anyone ever tell you you look just like Jim Dubois?</p>
              <p> MAN<br>
                The sheepfucker?</p>
              <p>Healy shrugs and the man walks away angrily.</p>

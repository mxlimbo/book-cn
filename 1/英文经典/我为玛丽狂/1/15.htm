                INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - SAME</p>
              <p>A disheveled and wired-looking Sully is sitting on the couch 
                in<br>
                his underwear READING FROM THE SAME SCRIPT. There's COKE on the 
                table, DOG SHIT on the floor, and FLIES everywhere.</p>
              <p>In the B.G. we see the Great Dane SNIFFING at his empty bowl 
                and the Boa Constrictor sprawled out on the floor, barely moving.</p>
              <p> SULLY<br>
                (reading)<br>
                Come on, you could tell her about the irrigation ditches you dug 
                in Sudan, the orphan babies who cried in your arms in<br>
                Romania...<br>
                (does a line of blow)<br>
                ...the hope you gave Freddie the leper in Calcutta...</p>
              <p>Suddenly the dog snatches the page out of his hand and STARTS 
                TO EAT IT.</p>
              <p>BACK ON Mary and friends.</p>
              <p> JOANNIE<br>
                (welling up)<br>
                I love this man.</p>
              <p>Magda folds her arms and gloats.</p>
              <p>INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Look, I did all those things for myself.<br>
                I'll be honest with you, I'm a selfish prick. I get a high from 
                helping all of God's creatures. An honest to goodness high.</p>
              <p>Just then, Healy sees a bug on the car window and instinctively<br>
                squashes it.</p>
              <p>ON SULLY - he has the phone wedged between his cheek and<br>
                shoulder as he STRUGGLES with the dog to get the script.</p>
              <p>Sully still can't retrieve the script, nor his next line.</p>
              <p> SULLY<br>
                (winging it)<br>
                That's bullshit, man you, uh, you were on the front line. Remember 
                the, uh, malaria the, uh, typhoon fever that vicious strain of 
                genital herpes?</p>
              <p>ON MARY AND FRIENDS - they flinch at this.</p>
              <p>ON HEALY - he stares at the phone, horrified.</p>
              <p> HEALY (V.O.)<br>
                Uh, sure. I cured a lot of nasty illnesses in third-world countries.</p>
              <p>ON MARY AND FRIENDS - as they let out a sigh.</p>
              <p> HEALY (V.O.) (cont'd)<br>
                The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some 
                form of currency...especially after what I did.<br>
                (SIGHS)<br>
                I lied to this poor girl. Lied. man. She deserved better.</p>
              <p> SULLY (V.O.)<br>
                Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.</p>
              <p> HEALY (V.O.)<br>
                You said it, mister.<br>
                (choking up)<br>
                I gotta go.</p>
              <p>ON SULLY - as he HANGS UP the phone and does another line, we</p>
              <p>PAN TO the Great Dane Hal as he looks around for something,<br>
                anything to eat. He SNIFFS at a sock, then a beer bottle, before<br>
                finally setting his sights on the Boa Constrictor Bill. Bill<br>
                glances the dog's way nervously, SENSES TROUBLE, and wiggles his 
                way into another room. As Hal TAKES OFF after the snake, we</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S HALLWAY - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Healy starts to knock on Mary's door, but, before he can, the 
                door suddenly swings open revealing a beaming Mary.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (startled)<br>
                Oh Mary. Look, there's something I have to tell you. I'm not</p>
              <p>Before he can finish, Mary steps forward and their mouths meet 
                in a passionate KISS. </p>
              <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
              <p>MONTAGE OF MARY AND HEALY COURTING</p>
              <p>--As Mary watches, Healy plays TOUCH FOOTBALL with Warren and 
                a few of his friends. Healy catches a pass then, trying a little 
                too hard to impress Mary, he delivers a forearm shiver to his 
                defender and gives Warren a vicious STRAIGHT-ARM. When Healy gets 
                into the end zone he spikes the ball and starts talking trash 
                to another defender.</p>
              <p>--Healy shows up at Mary's door sporting a set of OVERSIZED<br>
                INCREDIBLY-WHITE CAPPED TEETH. He gives her a big horse smile 
                and she reacts uncertainly.</p>
              <p>--Healy is in Mary's apartment as Mary finishes dressing for 
                a<br>
                night on the town.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                All set.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                You look great.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?</p>
              <p>When she puts her head close to inspect his pants, he lets fly 
                a<br>
                THUNDEROUS FART. She pulls her head away, repulsed, but Healy 
                just<br>
                LAUGHS.</p>
              <p>--Mary and and the horse-toothed Healy are having dinner in a<br>
                romantic restaurant. As he eats he tells an animated story but<br>
                he's having trouble with the new choppers and chunks of food are 
                spraying out of his mouth with every word. Mary has to BOB AND<br>
                WEAVE to avoid being covered with debris.</p>
              <p>--Healy and Warren are playing monopoly. When Warren isn't<br>
                looking, Healy cheats and puts a couple hotels on Boardwalk. In<br>
                the b.g. we see one of Warren's buddies fall out of a palm tree.</p>
              <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
              <p>EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
              <p>A lovesick Healy is mauling Mary out on the sidewalk in front<br>
                while Warren stands off to the side LISTENING TO A WALKMAN.</p>
              <p>REVERSE ANGLE reveals a devastated Ted and Dom watching this 
                from Ted's car.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Fuck me.<br>
                (sighs)<br>
                Let's go home.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over 
                there and do something--I can't stand watching this.</p>
              <p>BACK ON MARY AND HEALY as Healy starts OVER-DOING IT and Mary 
                has to break it off.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Whoa, whoa, how's my stomach taste?</p>
              <p>Healy LAUGHS.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                How's my stomach taste, she says.<br>
                (shakes head)<br>
                Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab,<br>
                Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Forget it. It was...fun.</p>
              <p>ON TED AND DOM</p>
              <p>Ted recognizes Warren.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Holy shit, there's Warren.</p>
              <p>BACK ON MARY. HEALY, AND WARREN</p>
              <p>Suddenly we see Warren PERK UP at something.</p>
              <p> WARREN<br>
                Franks and beans!</p>
              <p>ON TED AND DOM</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.</p>
              <p>They both duck down in their seats.</p>
              <p>BACK ON MARY. HEALY. AND WARREN</p>
              <p> WARREN<br>
                Beans and franks.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Give it a rest, War. You just ate.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Aw, leave him alone, he's just got a big appetite.<br>
                (to Warren)<br>
                Am I right?</p>
              <p>Healy winks at Mary.</p>
              <p> WARREN<br>
                Huh?</p>
              <p>Healy reaches over and lifts a headphone off Warren's ear.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                I said you've got a big app--</p>
              <p>Suddenly Warren SUCKER-PUNCHES HEALY IN THE THROAT.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                Urrggghh...</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Warren!</p>
              <p>ON TED AND DOM - as they flinch.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Attaboy!</p>
              <p>BACK ON MARY et al - Healy holds his throat, clearly in pain.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Are you okay?</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                (raspy, to Mary)<br>
                Not to worry. So...see you tonight,<br>
                right? Right?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (cornered)<br>
                Sure.</p>
              <p>Mary watches with a look of concern as Healy gets in his car 
                and<br>
                drives off.</p>
              <p>ON TED AND DOM</p>
              <p>Ted stares gazily.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Well? What are you waiting for?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I don't know what to say.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be 
                fucking pissed.<br>
                (stares at Mary)<br>
                She's even more beautiful than I remember.</p>
              <p>THEIR POV - Mary and Warren start to go in the apartment.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Get over there, you pussy! She's leaving!</p>
              <p>Suddenly Dom HONKS THE HORN, then ducks down. Mary turns around 
                and sees Ted.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                You asshole, what are you--<br>
                (CALLING OUT CHEERILY)<br>
                Mary! Is that you?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (squinting)<br>
                Who's that?</p>
              <p>Ted gets out of the car and hustles across the street toward 
                Mary.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                It is you! It's me...Ted. From Rhode Island Ted.</p>
              <p>Finally she recognizes him.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Oh my God...Ted.<br>
                (big smile)<br>
                What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since-- 
              </p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Yup, that's right. Junior prom...kinda.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                And did everything--?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.</p>
              <p>Mary LAUGHS.</p>
              <p> TED (cont'd)<br>
                How are you doing, Warren?</p>
              <p> WARREN<br>
                Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I'm gonna take a rain check.</p>
              <p>Mary is stunned.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Really? I never got a message.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.</p>
              <p>Ted is devastated to hear this.</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                By the way, how's he doing?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                He's dead.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (taken aback)<br>
                Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (bitter)<br>
                No, it was a good thing.<br>
                (off her look)<br>
                I mean, good in that it was very quick.</p>
              <p>Ted pantomimes an explosion.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Oh. So...what brings you down here?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to...ah...you 
                know...just ..drive down.</p>
              <p>She stares at him.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Nope, nope--dodged a few bullets.<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (taken aback)<br>
                Oh...are you...?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.<br>
                (off his look)<br>
                There was this guy back in college who was bothering me...got 
                kind of ugly--a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway,when 
                I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Jeez...that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner 
                tonight, catch up on old times?</p>
              <p>BEAT.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Didn't we just do that?</p>
              <p>Ted doesn't know how to respond to this and then she smiles.</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already 
                have plans. How about tomorrow night?</p>
              <p> TED<br>

                EXT. MIAMI STREET - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Healy and Mary are walking home at the end of their date. Healy 
                is eating a big, wild cone of COTTON CANDY and drinking a beer.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                That grandmother of yours--she's really something.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Magda? She's not my grandmother--actually she rents the apartment 
                right next to mine.<br>
                Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like 
                to be alone.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                And it doesn't cramp your style?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Lint?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug 
                all day--just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...</p>
              <p>Mary lifts her shirt, revealing a BIG CLUMP OF COTTON CANDY STICKING 
                OUT OF HER BELLY-BUTTON.</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                See? That's just one day.</p>
              <p>Healy CRACKS UP and then gazes at her. What a babe.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. 
                I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little<br>
                traveling...</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?</p>
              <p>It's clear Healy forgot about that one.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect 
                game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                You're a movie buff?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If 
                Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but<br>
                no thanks.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Have you seen it?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                A fucking moron.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Huh. I guess I just wish they made themlike they used to. You 
                know, something like The Heartbreak Kid...or Harold and<br>
                Maude.</p>
              <p>Mary can't believe her ears.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do 
                love it.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest--</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                --Love story of our time.</p>
              <p>Mary smiles. Is this guy for real?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Yeah.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Wow. I thought I was the only one.</p>
              <p>They come to her apartment building and stop. It gets a little<br>
                awkward.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                So...</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Yeah...I guess this is it, huh?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                I guess.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Well, I'll see ya.</p>
              <p>Healy turns to go but stops.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                Mary ah, forget it.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                What?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                No, forget it, it was stupid.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Come on, what were you going to say?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Nah, really, it was moronic.</p>
              <p>She grabs him by the shirt playfully.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Just say it.</p>
              <p>Healy takes a deep breath.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Could I feel your bosoms before I go?</p>
              <p>Mary just stares at him.</p>
              <p> MARY (beat)<br>
                Knock yourself out.</p>
              <p>Healy reaches out and cups her breasts. He doesn't kiss her, 
                she<br>
                doesn't kiss him, he just fondles her breasts. Then:</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Okey-dokey, so tomorrow night?</p>
              <p>She smiles and as Healy walks away we</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>INT. SOUTH CAROLINA PRISON - DAY</p>
              <p>Ted is sitting alone at a table in a small interrogation room.</p>
              <p>PULLBACK to reveal that he is being observed through a two-way 
                mirror by two detectives, FRANEK and CAVALLO.</p>
              <p> DETECTIVE FRANEK<br>
                Man, they never look like you'd expect.</p>
              <p> DETECTIVE CAVALLO<br>
                That's probably how he got the victim to drop his guard. </p>
              <p> DETECTIVE FRANEK<br>
                Where'd they find the body?</p>
              <p> DETECTIVE CAVALLO<br>
                In a big red bag on the front passenger seat. All hacked up--fucking 
                gruesome--a real psycho, this one.</p>
              <p>The Detectives ENTER the room.</p>
              <p>INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY</p>
              <p>Ted stands as the Detectives take a seat across from him.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (agitated)<br>
                I'm telling you, I did not solicit sex! I was just stopping to 
                go the bathroom, next thing I know I tripped over something--well<br>
                someone--and, POOF, there's cops and lights and--</p>
              <p> DETECTIVE FRANEK<br>
                Okay, calm down, Ted, we believe you.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                The problem is we found your friend in the car.</p>
              <p>As Ted sits back down the Detectives just stare at him. Finally<br>
                Ted thinks he gets it.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Oh. The hitchhiker.<br>
                (CHUCKLES)<br>
                That's what this is all about.</p>
              <p>Ted puts his head in his hands and smiles.</p>
              <p> TED (cont'd)<br>
                Isn't that just my luck--I get caught for<br>
                everything.</p>
              <p> DETECTIVE CAVALLO<br>
                So you admit it?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games<br>
                with you. I could give you a song and dance<br>
                but what's the point? I did it and we all<br>
                know it.<br>
                (laughs)<br>
                The hitcher himself told me it's<br>
                illegal The irony.</p>
              <p>The Detectives are surprised by his forthrightness.</p>
              <p> DETECTIVE CAVALLO<br>
                Well, uh, can you tell us his name?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Jeez, I didn't catch it.</p>
              <p>The Detectives flinch at his glib demeanor.</p>
              <p> DETECTIVE FRANEK<br>
                So he was a stranger? It was totally random?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (confused)<br>
                He was the first hitcher I saw, what can I tell you? Now cut to 
                the chase, how much trouble am I in? </p>
              <p>The Detectives look at one another. </p>
              <p> DETECTIVE FRANEK<br>
                First tell us why you did it.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Why I did it?<br>
                (scoffs)<br>
                I don't know. Boredom? I thought I was<br>
                doing the guy a favor.</p>
              <p>The Detectives look at each other.</p>
              <p> DETECTIVE CAVALLO<br>
                This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted?<br>
                How many we talking?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Hitchhikers? I don't know--fifty...a<br>
                hundred maybe--Who keeps track?</p>
              <p>Finally Detective Cavallo EXPLODES across the table and starts<br>
                WAILING on a shocked Ted.</p>
              <p> DETECTIVE CAVALLO<br>
                You sonofabitch! You're gonna fry!!!!</p>

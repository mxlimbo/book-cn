                ON BUSTY GIRL - The Ear-Muff Guy marches up to her and her boyfriend.</p>
              <p> EAR-MUFF GUY<br>
                You seen my pecker?</p>
              <p> GIRL<br>
                What?!</p>
              <p> EAR-MUFF GUY<br>
                You seen my pecker?</p>
              <p>The Boyfriend grabs him by the collar.</p>
              <p> BOYFRIEND<br>
                You son-of-a-bitch, I'll kick your ass!</p>
              <p>The Boyfriend throws the Ear-Muff Guy to the ground and is about 
                to pummel him when Ted intervenes.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Take it easy, Smokey.</p>
              <p> BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY<br>
                This fucking pervert just came on to Nance!</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                All right, just be cool.<br>
                (under breath)<br>
                He looks like he's not all there, you know what I mean?</p>
              <p>A crowd starts to gather which only incites Smokey more.</p>
              <p> BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY<br>
                Get the fuck out of my way, man!</p>
              <p>Smokey tosses Ted out of the way and moves toward the Ear-Muff 
                Guy. Just then Mary shows up and steps between them.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                What's going on here?</p>
              <p>She bends down and helps the Ear-Muff Guy off the ground.</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                Are you all right?</p>
              <p> EAR-MUFF GUY<br>
                Mary, you seen my baseball?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                No, I haven't seen your baseball. Jeez,<br>
                Warren, you know you're not supposed to<br>
                leave the yard by yourself.</p>
              <p> BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY<br>
                (to Mary)<br>
                You know him?</p>

                He's my brother.</p>
              <p> BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY<br>
                Oh.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                I didn't realize he was...you know...</p>
              <p>At this, Smokey and his girlfriend reluctantly head toward the<br>
                school, along with most of the crowd.</p>
              <p>Mary turns her attention in the direction Ted was thrown.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                You okay?</p>
              <p>HER POV - Ted is sitting in a mud puddle. He stands and brushes 
                himself off.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Oh yeah. Fine.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Thanks a lot, Ted.</p>
              <p>CLOSE ON - Ted. He can't believe what he's just heard. As Mary 
                helps him up, she turns her attention to Warren.</p>
              <p> MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)<br>
                That she knew my name blew my mind. Some of my best friends didn't 
                know my name.</p>
              <p>EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING</p>
              <p>Mary and a muddied Ted are walking Warren home. Warren lags<br>
                behind, mumbling to himself. Mary notices that Ted is limping.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                No, it's an old football injury.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Oh, are you on the team?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, 
                I fell off the school.</p>
              <p>Warren approaches and motions for Ted to hop on his back.</p>
              <p> WARREN<br>
                Piggyback ride?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Warren, come on, leave Ted alone.</p>
              <p>Warren pats his back again.</p>
              <p> WARREN<br>
                Piggyback ride.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (to Mary)<br>
                I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Oh he can hold you. He weighs two-hundred-and-thirty pounds.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?</p>
              <p>Ted hops onto Warren's back.</p>
              <p> TED (cont'd)<br>
                Giddy-up.</p>
              <p>Warren walks about five feet and stops.</p>
              <p> WARREN<br>
                My turn now.</p>
              <p>Off Ted's reaction, we</p>
              <p> CUT TO:<br>
                XT . MARY'S HOUSE - DAY</p>
              <p>Muddy sweat is running down Ted's face as he struggles up a hill<br>
                with Warren on his back.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (straining)<br>
                We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?</p>
              <p> WARREN<br>
                Giddy-up.</p>
              <p>Ted rolls his eyes and continues toward the front door. Mary 
                looks on, amused.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                So who you taking to the prom?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Huh?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                The prom--you going?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already 
                taking someone.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.</p>
              <p>She smiles at this.</p>
              <p> MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)<br>
                From that moment on the guys at school looked at me in a whole

              <p>EXT. CUMBERLAND HIGH SCHOOL - DAY</p>
              <p>PULLBACK TO REVEAL - Ted is leaning against his locker<br>

              <p> FRIEND #2<br>
                You expect us to believe you're going to the prom with Mary? What 
                about Woogie?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                They broke up. She said he started getting weird on her.</p>

              <p> FRIEND #1<br>
                Because you're a loser, and in some warped way this gives you

              <p>A tuxedoed and smiling Ted drives up in his parent's station<br>
                wagon.</p>
              <p>EXT. MARY' S FRONT DOOR - TWILIGHT</p>
              <p>Ted knocks on the door and Mary's gruff DAD answers.</p>
              <p> MARY'S DAD<br>
                Yeah? What do you want?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.</p>
              <p> MARY'S DAD<br>
                Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the 
                prom with her boyfriend Woogie.</p>
              <p>Ted looks devastated. Suddenly the door swings open revealing<br>
                MARY'S MOM.</p>
              <p> MARY'S MOM<br>
                Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted.<br>
                Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Oh.<br>
                (relieved)<br>
                Oh, that's a good one.</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT<br>
                Ted nervously enters and sees Warren watching T.V. in the den.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Hey, Warren.</p>
              <p>Warren doesn't look his way.</p>
              <p>Just then Mary comes down the stairs looking as if the directors<br>
                had really taken their time casting this role. Ted can't believe<br>
                his eyes.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Hi, Ted.</p>

                Hi, Mary.</p>
              <p> MARY'S MOM<br>
                Poor Teddy--he's been getting it both barrels from the Wisenheimer 
                here.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Dad, have you been busting Ted's chops?</p>
              <p>Mary's Dad shrugs.</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                Warren, did you say hi to Ted?</p>
              <p> WARREN<br>
                (not looking up)<br>
                'Bout ten times.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Hey, Warren, I think I know where your baseball is.</p>
              <p>This finally gets Warren's attention.</p>
              <p> WARREN<br>
                You seen my baseball?</p>
              <p>We see Ted discreetly pull a BRAND NEW BASEBALL out of his pocket 
                and palm it in his hand.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Well, if it's a big white one with red stitching, I think I saw 
                it right behind your ear ..</p>
              <p>Ted is reaching behind Warren's ear when suddenly Warren TAKES 
                A SWIPE AT HIM, knocking him to the ground.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Warren!!!</p>
              <p>Ted HITS HIS HEAD on the coffee table.</p>
              <p>ON THE BASEBALL - as it rolls under the couch, stopping right<br>
                next to the OTHER MISSING BALL.</p>
              <p>BACK TO SCENE - In a split second, Warren is up like a cat and 
                DIVES ONTO TED. As MARY AND HER PARENTS SCREAM, Ted manages to 
                free himself from the disabled man's clutches and GETS WARREN 
                IN A HEADLOCK.</p>
              <p> MARY'S DAD<br>

                (out of breath)<br>
                I'm trying...tell him to...calm down.</p>
              <p>The family jumps on Warren and finally break it up.</p>
              <p> MARY'S DAD (cont'd)<br>

                Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.</p>
              <p> MARY'S MOM<br>
                What baseball? Where's a baseball?</p>
              <p>Ted looks around but there's no ball in sight.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                There was a ball I had a honest.</p>
              <p>As Mary helps Ted up, we see that his shirttail is out and his 
                tie<br>
                is hanging off. Mary's parents lead the frothing Warren back to<br>
                the couch.</p>
              <p> MARY (to Ted)<br>
                I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Oh. Okay. I gotcha.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Are you all right?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Oh yeah.</p>
              <p> MARY'S MOM<br>
                (to Mary)<br>
                Honey, now you're all wrinkled.</p>
              <p>Mary looks down and frowns.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Ted, will you just give me one more minute?<br>
                I have to iron this thing.</p>
              <p>Ted starts to tuck his pants in as Mary and her mother head back<br>
                up the stairs. Mary's Dad and Ted are left alone. And Warren.</p>
              <p>Ted rubs his head, sees a spot of blood.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (to Mary's Dad)<br>
                May I use your bathroom?</p>
              <p>INT. BATHROOM - TWILIGHT</p>
              <p>Ted dabs his head with a tissue, then moves to the toilet. As 
                he<br>
                TAKES A LEAK he glances out the window to his left.</p>
              <p>TED'S POV - two LOVEBIRDS are perched on a branch.</p>
              <p>Ted smiles...</p>
              <p>...at the SOUND of these beautiful tweeties singing their love<br>
                song for themselves, for the spring, for Ted and Mary, and<br>
                suddenly they fly away and we...</p>
              <p>SNAP FOCUS</p>
              <p>...to reveal Mary in the bedroom window DIRECTLY BEHIND WHERE 
                THE BIRDS WERE, in just a bra and panties, and just then her mother 
                glances Ted's way and MAKES EYECONTACT with what she can only 
                presume to be a leering Peeping Tom.</p>
              <p>ON TED...</p>
              <p>...he loses the smile and ducks his head back into the bathroom,<br>

                EXT. MARY'S OFFICE - MORNING</p>
              <p>Mary pulls up in her Honda Civic. She parks out front and enters<br>
                the building.</p>
              <p>PAN ACROSS THE STREET TO REVEAL - Healy is parked in his car.<br>
                His surveillance equipment is pointed toward Mary's office.</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S OFFICE - MORNING</p>
              <p>Mary walks into the office and sees a MEDICAL ASSISTANT standing 
                near the coffee maker.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Mornin', Jane.</p>
              <p> MEDICAL ASSISTANT #1<br>
                Good morning, Doctor. Your friend Tucker's in your office to see 
                you. </p>
              <p>Mary nods and heads toward her office. </p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S OFFICE - SAME</p>
              <p>Mary walks into her office and sees Tucker seated at her desk.<br>
                (SHOT FROM behind Tucker so we only see the back of his head.)</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                What's up, Doc?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with 
                your hair?</p>
              <p>MARY'S POV - Tucker's got two TONGUE DEPRESSORS under his upper 
                lip making him look like a walrus.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                The teeth, the teeth. I got 'em capped.</p>
              <p>ON MARY - smiles.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Oh yeah, they look great.</p>
              <p>INT. HEALY'S CAR - SAME</p>
              <p>He's got his listening gun fixed on Mary's office.</p>
              <p> TUCKER (V.O.)<br>
                You don't think they're too big?</p>
              <p> MARY (V.O.)<br>
                No no, the bigger the better.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier 
                than a mouthful of pearly whites.</p>
              <p>Healy looks at his teeth in the mirror. Not exactly pearly.</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>Tucker pulls the tongue depressors out of his teeth and laughs. 
                He stands up, and when Mary tries to squeeze past him he gives 
                her a kiss on the cheek.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                You ever been laid in this office?</p>
              <p>Mary pushes past him.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Behave yourself, Tucker.<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                Come on, what are you doing here?</p>
              <p>She sits in her chair and leans against her desk.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                I wanted to talk to you about your friend Patrick.</p>
              <p>EXT. HEALY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>Healy almost flies out of his seat.</p>
              <p> MARY (O.S.)<br>
                He's a nice guy, isn't he?</p>
              <p> TUCKER (O.S.)<br>
                Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known 
                him?</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>Tucker has a look of concern.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Not long at all, but I really like him.<br>
                (off Tucker's look)<br>
                Okay, I know he's a little different,<br>
                Tucker, but that's what I like about him.<br>
                He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs 
                and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, 
                too. And that's okay with me.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                That's what you've been looking for--a farter?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                I've been looking for a guy--not one of these South Beach pussies.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                (SIGHS)<br>
                Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last 
                night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends 
                back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy 
                and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.</p>
              <p>INT. HEALY'S CAR - SAME</p>
              <p>Healy SLAMS his hand on the steering wheel.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Fuck!!</p>
              <p> MARY (O.S.)<br>
                Huh...that's strange.</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S OFFICE - SAME</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. 
                I just think you should be careful with this guy.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (concerned)<br>
                No no no, Tucker, thank you.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, 
                you trust people--I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out 
                there.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (small smile)<br>
                I appreciate you looking out for me.</p>

              <p>CLOSE ON - Detective Franek as he SPEAKS, sheepishly. His<br>
                remorseful- looking partner Cavallo stands behind him.</p>
              <p> DETECTIVE FRANEK<br>
                On behalf of the entire South Carolina law enforcement community, 
                I would like to offer our heartfelt apologies for any pain or 
                temporary inconvenience we may have caused you, Mr. Peloquin.</p>
              <p>REVERSE ANGLE - reveals that Ted is lying on his prison bed<br>
                being spooned by a 300-pound SLEEPING INMATE.</p>
              <p>INT. PRISON HALLWAY</p>
              <p>The two Detectives and an apoplectic Ted walk down the hallway.</p>
              <p> DETECTIVE FRANEK<br>
                At exactly 10:48 this morning a man was apprehended not far from 
                where you were arrested. He was identified as an escaped<br>
                mental patient and subsequently confessed to the murder that you 
                were being held for. Lab tests confirmed a fingerprint match on<br>
                the bag.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (fragile)<br>
                So...I'm free to go?</p>
              <p>Detective Cavallo stops and holds out his hand.</p>
              <p> DETECTIVE CAVALLO<br>
                No harm, no foul?</p>
              <p> TED<br>

                I guess.</p>
              <p>Still traumatized, Ted shakes the man's hand, then mopes toward<br>
                the door.</p>
              <p> DETECTIVE FRANEK<br>
                By the way, there's somebody here to see you.</p>

              <p>Dom is driving; a bruised and somber Ted is in the passenger 
                seat.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I am?</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your 
                throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe 
                up your ass, man.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Yeah feels like it.</p>

                Flew.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.</p>
              <p>Ted gives him a look.</p>
              <p> DOM (cont'd)<br>
                I hate to ruin your day, Ted, but I have some bad news for you.</p>

              <p> DOM<br>
                Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his 
                last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's<br>
                apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's 
                been dead for ten years.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                And this adversely affects me how...?</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Don't you see?--Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord 
                said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling 
                for some doctor named Mary!</p>
              <p>Ted is stunned.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Huh? What? No...My Mary? Mary wouldn't go for him....would she?</p>
              <p>Dom hands Ted a SLIP OF PAPER.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                His address in Miami. You know, when you think about it, we really 
                don't know the first thing about this guy.</p>
              <p>Finally the implications of this dawn on Ted.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Jesus Christ what have I done?</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>

                Would you hens quit ya cackling and let her do what she wants

                Mary, the guy's full of shit.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                What if he's not? What if Tucker just made<br>
                an honest mistake?</p>
              <p> LISA<br>
                What if he didn't?</p>
              <p>It's clear that Mary is torn.</p>

                I don't know how I can bail now, he's going<br>
                to be here any minute.</p>

              <p> MARY<br>
                But you didn't meet him. He seems so I<br>
                don't know...perfect...kind of.</p>

                He has a big cock, doesn't he?</p>

              <p> MAGDA<br>
                I think you better listen to this.</p>
              <p>Magda turns up the volume on her scanner and we can clearly hear<br>
                Healy TALKING ON HIS CELLULAR PHONE. Mary and her girlfriends<br>
                gather around.</p>

                Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary<br>
                girl I told you about.</p>

                The sawbones?</p>
              <p> HEALY (V.O.)<br>
                Yep.</p>
              <p>The girls all look at one another.</p>
              <p> BRENDA<br>
                We hit the motherlode.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                We shouldn't be listening to this.</p>
              <p> LISA AND JOANNIE<br>
                Shhh.</p>
              <p> SULLY (V.O.)<br>
                She still think you're a fucking architect?</p>
              <p> HEALY (V.O.)<br>
                Oh yeah.</p>
              <p> SULLY (V.O.)<br>

                Turn it up, Magda.</p>
              <p> HEALY (V.O.)<br>
                Hey, watch your mouth--she's a great gal.<br>
                I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.</p>
              <p> SULLY (V.O.)<br>
                Why didn't you just tell her the truth?</p>
              <p> HEALY (V.O.)<br>
                I don't know. I guess...it just seems that women today are more 
                impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent<br>
                the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.</p>

              <p> SULLY (V.O.)<br>
                But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to 
                want to hear about the things you did. </p>

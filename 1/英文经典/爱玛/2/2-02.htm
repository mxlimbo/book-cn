              VOLUME II <br>
            </p>
            <p align="center">CHAPTER II <br>
            </p>
            <p>Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's youngest 
              daughter. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry, 
              and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope 
              and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy 
              remembrance of him dying in action abroad--of his widow sinking 
              under consumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl. <br>
            </p>
            <p>By birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, 
              on losing her mother, she became the property, the charge, the consolation, 
              the fondling of her grandmother and aunt, there had seemed every 
              probability of her being permanently fixed there; of her being taught 
              only what very limited means could command, and growing up with 
              no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what 
              nature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and 
              warm-hearted, well-meaning relations. <br>
            </p>
            <p>But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a 
              change to her destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly 
              regarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young 
              man; and farther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, 
              during a severe camp-fever, as he believed had saved his life. These 
              were claims which he did not learn to overlook, though some years 
              passed away from the death of poor Fairfax, before his own return 
              to England put any thing in his power. When he did return, he sought 
              out the child and took notice of her. He was a married man, with 
              only one living child, a girl, about Jane's age: and Jane became 
              their guest, paying them long visits and growing a favourite with 
              all; and before she was nine years old, his daughter's great fondness 
              for her, and his own wish of being a real friend, united to produce 
              an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of 
              her education. It was accepted; and from that period Jane had belonged 
              to Colonel Campbell's family, and had lived with them entirely, 
              only visiting her grandmother from time to time. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; 
              the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father 
              making independence impossible. To provide for her otherwise was 
              out of Colonel Campbell's power; for though his income, by pay and 
              appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be 
              all his daughter's; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to 
              be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Such was Jane Fairfax's history. She had fallen into good hands, 
              known nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an 
              excellent education. Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed 
              people, her heart and understanding had received every advantage 
              of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's residence being 
              in London, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by 
              the attendance of first-rate masters. Her disposition and abilities 
              were equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen 
              or nineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified 
              for the care of children, fully competent to the office of instruction 
              herself; but she was too much beloved to be parted with. Neither 
              father nor mother could promote, and the daughter could not endure 
              it. The evil day was put off. It was easy to decide that she was 
              still too young; and Jane remained with them, sharing, as another 
              daughter, in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society, and 
              a judicious mixture of home and amusement, with only the drawback 
              of the future, the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding 
              to remind her that all this might soon be over. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss 
              Campbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party from 
              the circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty and 
              acquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen 
              by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt 
              by the parents. They continued together with unabated regard however, 
              till the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck 
              which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving 
              attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior, 
              engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, 
              almost as soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily 
              settled, while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn. <br>
            </p>
            <p>This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing 
              to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering 
              on her path of duty; though she had now reached the age which her 
              own judgment had fixed on for beginning. She had long resolved that 
              one-and-twenty should be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted 
              novitiate, she had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, 
              and retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, 
              equal society, peace and hope, to penance and mortification for 
              ever. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such 
              a resolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, 
              no exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; 
              and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but 
              this would be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better be 
              soon. Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser 
              to have resisted the temptation of any delay, and spared her from 
              a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. 
              Still, however, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse 
              for not hurrying on the wretched moment. She had never been quite 
              well since the time of their daughter's marriage; and till she should 
              have completely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her 
              engaging in duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened 
              frame and varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances, 
              to require something more than human perfection of body and mind 
              to be discharged with tolerable comfort. <br>
              <br>
              With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account 
              to her aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some 
              truths not told. It was her own choice to give the time of their 
              absence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect 
              liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear: 
              and the Campbells, whatever might be their motive or motives, whether 
              single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, 
              and said, that they depended more on a few months spent in her native 
              air, for the recovery of her health, than on any thing else. Certain 
              it was that she was to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming 
              that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it--Mr. Frank 
              Churchill--must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could 
              bring only the freshness of a two years' absence. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did 
              not like through three long months!--to be always doing more than 
              she wished, and less than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax 
              might be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once 
              told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young 
              woman, which she wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation 
              had been eagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination 
              in which her conscience could not quite acquit her. But &quot;she 
              could never get acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, 
              but there was such coldness and reserve-- such apparent indifference 
              whether she pleased or not--and then, her aunt was such an eternal 
              talker!--and she was made such a fuss with by every body!--and it 
              had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate--because 
              their ages were the same, every body had supposed they must be so 
              fond of each other.&quot; These were her reasons-- she had no better. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>It was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified 
              by fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any 
              considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; 
              and now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two 
              years' interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance 
              and manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating. 
              Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself 
              the highest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such 
              as almost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very 
              tall; her figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming 
              medium, between fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health 
              seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not 
              but feel all this; and then, her face--her features-- there was 
              more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered; it was not 
              regular, but it was very pleasing beauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, 
              with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied their praise; 
              but the skin, which she had been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, 
              had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom. 
              It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was the reigning character, 
              and as such, she must, in honour, by all her principles, admire 
              it:--elegance, which, whether of person or of mind, she saw so little 
              in Highbury. There, not to be vulgar, was distinction, and merit. 
              <br>
              <br>
              In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax 
              with twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of 
              rendering justice, and was determining that she would dislike her 
              no longer. When she took in her history, indeed, her situation, 
              as well as her beauty; when she considered what all this elegance 
              was destined to, what she was going to sink from, how she was going 
              to live, it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and 
              respect; especially, if to every well-known particular entitling 
              her to interest, were added the highly probable circumstance of 
              an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had so naturally started to 
              herself. In that case, nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable 
              than the sacrifices she had resolved on. Emma was very willing now 
              to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon's actions from his wife, 
              or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested 
              at first. If it were love, it might be simple, single, successless 
              love on her side alone. She might have been unconsciously sucking 
              in the sad poison, while a sharer of his conversation with her friend; 
              and from the best, the purest of motives, might now be denying herself 
              this visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself effectually 
              from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious 
              duty. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings, 
              as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury 
              afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody 
              that she could wish to scheme about for her. <br>
            </p>
            <p>These were charming feelings--but not lasting. Before she had committed 
              herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane 
              Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and 
              errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, &quot;She certainly is handsome; 
              she is better than handsome!&quot; Jane had spent an evening at 
              Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing 
              much into its usual state. Former provocations reappeared. The aunt 
              was as tiresome as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her 
              health was now added to admiration of her powers; and they had to 
              listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter 
              she ate for breakfast, and how small a slice of mutton for dinner, 
              as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her 
              mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again. They had music; 
              Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which necessarily 
              followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an air of greatness, 
              meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance. 
              She was, besides, which was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious! 
              There was no getting at her real opinion. Wrapt up in a cloak of 
              politeness, she seemed determined to hazard nothing. She was disgustingly, 
              was suspiciously reserved. <br>
            </p>
            <p>If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved 
              on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She seemed 
              bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, or her 
              own value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the 
              match. It was all general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated 
              or distinguished. It did her no service however. Her caution was 
              thrown away. Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her first surmises. 
              There probably was something more to conceal than her own preference; 
              Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near changing one friend for the 
              other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the 
              future twelve thousand pounds. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. Frank Churchill 
              had been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that they were 
              a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could 
              Emma procure as to what he truly was. &quot;Was he handsome?&quot;--&quot;She 
              believed he was reckoned a very fine young man.&quot; &quot;Was 
              he agreeable?&quot;-- &quot;He was generally thought so.&quot; &quot;Did 
              he appear a sensible young man; a young man of information?&quot;--&quot;At 
              a watering-place, or in a common London acquaintance, it was difficult 
              to decide on such points. Manners were all that could be safely 
              judged of, under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of 
              Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found his manners pleasing.&quot; 
              Emma could not forgive her. </p>

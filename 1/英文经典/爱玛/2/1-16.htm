              VOLUME I<br>
            </p>
            <p align="center">CHAPTER XVI <br>
            </p>
            <p>The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down 
              to think and be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such 
              an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development 
              of every thing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was 
              the worst of all. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, 
              of some sort or other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all 
              was light; and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more 
              mistaken-- more in error--more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she 
              actually was, could the effects of her blunders have been confined 
              to herself. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could 
              have borne any thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me-- 
              but poor Harriet!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>How she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he had 
              never thought seriously of Harriet--never! She looked back as well 
              as she could; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, 
              she supposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, 
              must have been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have 
              been so misled. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!-- and the 
              charade!--and an hundred other circumstances;-- how clearly they 
              had seemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its 
              &quot;ready wit&quot;--but then the &quot;soft eyes&quot;-- in fact 
              it suited neither; it was a jumble without taste or truth. Who could 
              have seen through such thick-headed nonsense? <br>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners 
              to herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, 
              as a mere error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof 
              among others that he had not always lived in the best society, that 
              with all the gentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes 
              wanting; but, till this very day, she had never, for an instant, 
              suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet's 
              friend. <br>
            </p>
            <p>To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the 
              subject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying 
              that those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightley 
              had once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given, 
              the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry 
              indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of 
              his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. 
              It was dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, 
              in many respects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed 
              him; proud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and 
              little concerned about the feelings of others. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to 
              pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions 
              and his proposals did him no service. She thought nothing of his 
              attachment, and was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, 
              and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to 
              be in love; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any 
              disappointment that need be cared for. There had been no real affection 
              either in his language or manners. Sighs and fine words had been 
              given in abundance; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions, 
              or fancy any tone of voice, less allied with real love. She need 
              not trouble herself to pity him. He only wanted to aggrandise and 
              enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield, the heiress 
              of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so easily obtained as 
              he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty, 
              or with ten. <br>
            </p>
            <p>But--that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her 
              as aware of his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), 
              to marry him!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion or 
              mind!--look down upon her friend, so well understanding the gradations 
              of rank below him, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy 
              himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!-- It was most 
              provoking. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he 
              was her inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The 
              very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it; but 
              he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his 
              superior. He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for 
              several generations at Hartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient 
              family--and that the Eltons were nobody. The landed property of 
              Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable, being but a sort of notch 
              in the Donwell Abbey estate, to which all the rest of Highbury belonged; 
              but their fortune, from other sources, was such as to make them 
              scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself, in every other kind 
              of consequence; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in 
              the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr. Elton had first 
              entered not two years ago, to make his way as he could, without 
              any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend him to notice 
              but his situation and his civility.-- But he had fancied her in 
              love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; and 
              after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners 
              and a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop 
              and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant 
              and obliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her 
              real motive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation 
              and delicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided 
              favourite. If she had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little 
              right to wonder that he, with self-interest to blind him, should 
              have mistaken hers. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, 
              it was wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people 
              together. It was adventuring too far, assuming too much, making 
              light of what ought to be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. 
              She was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things 
              no more. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Here have I,&quot; said she, &quot;actually talked poor Harriet 
              into being very much attached to this man. She might never have 
              thought of him but for me; and certainly never would have thought 
              of him with hope, if I had not assured her of his attachment, for 
              she is as modest and humble as I used to think him. Oh! that I had 
              been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin. There 
              I was quite right. That was well done of me; but there I should 
              have stopped, and left the rest to time and chance. I was introducing 
              her into good company, and giving her the opportunity of pleasing 
              some one worth having; I ought not to have attempted more. But now, 
              poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time. I have been but half 
              a friend to her; and if she were not to feel this disappointment 
              so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who 
              would be at all desirable for her;--William Coxe--Oh! no, I could 
              not endure William Coxe-- a pert young lawyer.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed 
              a more serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, 
              and might be, and must be. The distressing explanation she had to 
              make to Harriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with 
              the awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing 
              or discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing 
              resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in most 
              unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at 
              last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered 
              most dreadfully. <br>
            </p>
            <p>To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma's, though under temporary 
              gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return 
              of spirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy, 
              and of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough 
              to keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations 
              of softened pain and brighter hope. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had 
              gone to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, 
              and to depend on getting tolerably out of it. <br>
            </p>
            <p>It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really 
              in love with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking 
              to disappoint him--that Harriet's nature should not be of that superior 
              sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive-- and that 
              there could be no necessity for any body's knowing what had passed 
              except the three principals, and especially for her father's being 
              given a moment's uneasiness about it. <br>
              <br>
              These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal 
              of snow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was 
              welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at 
              present. <br>
              <br>
              The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she 
              could not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable 
              had his daughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either 
              exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The 
              ground covered with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state 
              between frost and thaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly 
              for exercise, every morning beginning in rain or snow, and every 
              evening setting in to freeze, she was for many days a most honourable 
              prisoner. No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church 
              for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to 
              find excuses for Mr. Elton's absenting himself. <br>
            </p>
            <p>It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and 
              though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in 
              some society or other, it was very pleasant to have her father so 
              well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too wise 
              to stir out; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather 
              could keep entirely from them,-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor 
              Mr. Elton?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>These days of confinement would have been, but for her private 
              perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly 
              suited her brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance 
              to his companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off 
              his ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him 
              during the rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable 
              and obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all 
              the hopes of cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, 
              there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation 
              with Harriet, as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly 
              at ease. </p>

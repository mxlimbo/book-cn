            </p>
            <p align="center"> </p>
            <p>Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting 
              situations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is 
              sure of being kindly spoken of. <br>
            </p>
            <p>A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins's name was first mentioned 
              in Highbury, before she was, by some means or other, discovered 
              to have every recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, 
              elegant, highly accomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. 
              Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects, and circulate 
              the fame of her merits, there was very little more for him to do, 
              than to tell her Christian name, and say whose music she principally 
              played. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He had gone away rejected 
              and mortified--disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series 
              of what appeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing 
              the right lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very 
              wrong one. He had gone away deeply offended--he came back engaged 
              to another--and to another as superior, of course, to the first, 
              as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is 
              lost. He came back gay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring 
              nothing for Miss Woodhouse, and defying Miss Smith. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages 
              of perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent 
              fortune, of so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point 
              of some dignity, as well as some convenience: the story told well; 
              he had not thrown himself away--he had gained a woman of 10,000 
              l. or thereabouts; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity-- 
              the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by 
              distinguishing notice; the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole 
              of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious--the steps 
              so quick, from the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green's, 
              and the party at Mrs. Brown's--smiles and blushes rising in importance-- 
              with consciousness and agitation richly scattered--the lady had 
              been so easily impressed--so sweetly disposed--had in short, to 
              use a most intelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him, 
              that vanity and prudence were equally contented. <br>
            </p>
            <p>He had caught both substance and shadow--both fortune and affection, 
              and was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself 
              and his own concerns--expecting to be congratulated--ready to be 
              laughed at--and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all 
              the young ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would 
              have been more cautiously gallant. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves 
              to please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; 
              and when he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, 
              which a certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to contradict, 
              that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride. <br>
            </p>
            <p>During his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just 
              enough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her 
              the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique 
              and pretension, now spread over his air. She was, in fact, beginning 
              very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all; 
              and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable 
              feelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, 
              a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind, she would have 
              been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again. She wished 
              him very well; but he gave her pain, and his welfare twenty miles 
              off would administer most satisfaction. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must 
              certainly be lessened by his marriage. Many vain solicitudes would 
              be prevented-- many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A Mrs. Elton would 
              be an excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might 
              sink without remark. It would be almost beginning their life of 
              civility again. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She was good 
              enough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury-- 
              handsome enough--to look plain, probably, by Harriet's side. As 
              to connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after 
              all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing. 
              On that article, truth seemed attainable. What she was, must be 
              uncertain; but who she was, might be found out; and setting aside 
              the 10,000 l., it did not appear that she was at all Harriet's superior. 
              She brought no name, no blood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the 
              youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol-- merchant, of course, 
              he must be called; but, as the whole of the profits of his mercantile 
              life appeared so very moderate, it was not unfair to guess the dignity 
              of his line of trade had been very moderate also. Part of every 
              winter she had been used to spend in Bath; but Bristol was her home, 
              the very heart of Bristol; for though the father and mother had 
              died some years ago, an uncle remained-- in the law line--nothing 
              more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him, than that he was 
              in the law line; and with him the daughter had lived. Emma guessed 
              him to be the drudge of some attorney, and too stupid to rise. And 
              all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder 
              sister, who was very well married, to a gentleman in a great way, 
              near Bristol, who kept two carriages! That was the wind-up of the 
              history; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all!She 
              had talked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be 
              talked out of it. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies 
              of Harriet's mind was not to be talked away. He might be superseded 
              by another; he certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; 
              even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but nothing else, 
              she feared, would cure her. Harriet was one of those, who, having 
              once begun, would be always in love. And now, poor girl! she was 
              considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton. She was 
              always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other. Emma saw him 
              only once; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure just 
              to meet with him, or just to miss him, just to hear his voice, or 
              see his shoulder, just to have something occur to preserve him in 
              her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture. 
              She was, moreover, perpetually hearing about him; for, excepting 
              when at Hartfield, she was always among those who saw no fault in 
              Mr. Elton, and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of 
              his concerns; and every report, therefore, every guess--all that 
              had already occurred, all that might occur in the arrangement of 
              his affairs, comprehending income, servants, and furniture, was 
              continually in agitation around her. Her regard was receiving strength 
              by invariable praise of him, and her regrets kept alive, and feelings 
              irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins's happiness, 
              and continual observation of, how much he seemed attached!-- his 
              air as he walked by the house--the very sitting of his hat, being 
              all in proof of how much he was in love! <br>
            </p>
            <p>Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to 
              her friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet's 
              mind, Emma would have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. 
              Elton predominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally 
              useful as a check to the other. Mr. Elton's engagement had been 
              the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness 
              produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put 
              aside by Elizabeth Martin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's a few days 
              afterwards. Harriet had not been at home; but a note had been prepared 
              and left for her, written in the very style to touch; a small mixture 
              of reproach, with a great deal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself 
              appeared, she had been much occupied by it, continually pondering 
              over what could be done in return, and wishing to do more than she 
              dared to confess. But Mr. Elton, in person, had driven away all 
              such cares. While he staid, the Martins were forgotten; and on the 
              very morning of his setting off for Bath again, Emma, to dissipate 
              some of the distress it occasioned, judged it best for her to return 
              Elizabeth Martin's visit. <br>
            </p>
            <p>How that visit was to be acknowledged--what would be necessary-- 
              and what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration. 
              Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, 
              would be ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal 
              of the acquaintance!-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>After much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than 
              Harriet's returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had understanding, 
              should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance. 
              She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the Abbey Mill, 
              while she drove a little farther, and call for her again so soon, 
              as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences 
              to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy 
              was chosen for the future. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She could think of nothing better: and though there was something 
              in it which her own heart could not approve--something of ingratitude, 
              merely glossed over--it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?

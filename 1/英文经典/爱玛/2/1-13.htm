            </p>
            <p>There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. 
              John Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every 
              morning among her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking 
              over what she had done every evening with her father and sister. 
              She had nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass 
              so swiftly. It was a delightful visit;--perfect, in being much too 
              short. <br>
            </p>
            <p>In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their 
              mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house 
              too, there was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would 
              take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;--even Mr. 
              Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference 
              to a division of the party. <br>
            </p>
            <p>How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty 
              if he could, but as his son and daughter's carriage and horses were 
              actually at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple 
              question on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it 
              occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages 
              find room for Harriet also. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, 
              were the only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be 
              early, as well as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination 
              being consulted in every thing. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event 
              that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had 
              been spent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much 
              indisposed with a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being 
              nursed by Mrs. Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave 
              the house. Emma called on her the next day, and found her doom already 
              signed with regard to Randalls. She was very feverish and had a 
              bad sore throat: Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. 
              Perry was talked of, and Harriet herself was too ill and low to 
              resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement, 
              though she could not speak of her loss without many tears. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard's 
              unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how 
              much Mr. Elton's would be depressed when he knew her state; and 
              left her at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence 
              of his having a most comfortless visit, and of their all missing 
              her very much. She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's 
              door, when she was met by Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards 
              it, and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about 
              the invalid-- of whom he, on the rumour of considerable illness, 
              had been going to inquire, that he might carry some report of her 
              to Hartfield-- they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning 
              from the daily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest boys, whose 
              healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, 
              and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice 
              pudding they were hastening home for. They joined company and proceeded 
              together. Emma was just describing the nature of her friend's complaint;-- 
              &quot;a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about 
              her, a quick, low pulse, &amp;c. and she was sorry to find from 
              Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and 
              had often alarmed her with them.&quot; Mr. Elton looked all alarm 
              on the occasion, as he exclaimed, </p>
            <p>&quot;A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid 
              infectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care 
              of yourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run 
              no risks. Why does not Perry see her?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised 
              this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience 
              and care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness 
              which she could not wish to reason away, which she would rather 
              feed and assist than not, she added soon afterwards--as if quite 
              another subject, <br>
              <br>
              &quot;It is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much 
              like snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other 
              party, I should really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my 
              father from venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does 
              not seem to feel the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as 
              I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. 
              But, upon my word, Mr. Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse 
              myself. You appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you consider 
              what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think 
              it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take 
              care of yourself to-night.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to 
              make; which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified 
              by the kind care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any 
              advice of her's, he had not really the least inclination to give 
              up the visit;-- but Emma, too eager and busy in her own previous 
              conceptions and views to hear him impartially, or see him with clear 
              vision, was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment 
              of its being &quot;very cold, certainly very cold,&quot; and walked 
              on, rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls, and secured 
              him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of 
              the evening. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You do quite right,&quot; said she;--&quot;we will make your 
              apologies to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly 
              offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's 
              only objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with 
              much prompt satisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to 
              go, and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure 
              than at this moment; never had his smile been stronger, nor his 
              eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Well,&quot; said she to herself, &quot;this is most strange!--After 
              I had got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave 
              Harriet ill behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe, 
              in many men, especially single men, such an inclination-- such a 
              passion for dining out--a dinner engagement is so high in the class 
              of their pleasures, their employments, their dignities, almost their 
              duties, that any thing gives way to it--and this must be the case 
              with Mr. Elton; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, 
              and very much in love with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse 
              an invitation, he must dine out wherever he is asked. What a strange 
              thing love is! he can see ready wit in Harriet, but will not dine 
              alone for her.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do 
              him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment 
              in his manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice 
              while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard's for news 
              of her fair friend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness 
              of meeting her again, when he hoped to be able to give a better 
              report; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left 
              the balance of approbation much in his favour. <br>
            </p>
            <p>After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley 
              began with-- <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable 
              than Mr. Elton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. 
              With men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies 
              to please, every feature works.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect,&quot; replied Emma; 
              &quot;but where there is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, 
              and one does overlook a great deal. Where a man does his best with 
              only moderate powers, he will have the advantage over negligent 
              superiority. There is such perfect good-temper and good-will in 
              Mr. Elton as one cannot but value.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Yes,&quot; said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, 
              &quot;he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Me!&quot; she replied with a smile of astonishment, &quot;are 
              you imagining me to be Mr. Elton's object?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it 
              never occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration 
              now.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether 
              it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think 
              your manners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You 
              had better look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you 
              mean to do.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. 
              Elton and I are very good friends, and nothing more;&quot; and she 
              walked on, amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders 
              which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances, of 
              the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for 
              ever falling into; and not very well pleased with her brother for 
              imagining her blind and ignorant, and in want of counsel. He said 
              no more. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, 
              that in spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea 
              of shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with 
              his eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness 
              of the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder 
              of his own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls 
              to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, 
              however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage was in 
              motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down,and the 
              sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a 
              milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. 
              The preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice 
              of his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at 
              least, which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated 
              nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and 
              the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing 
              his discontent. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;A man,&quot; said he, &quot;must have a very good opinion 
              of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside, and 
              encounter such a day as this, for the sake of coming to see him. 
              He must think himself a most agreeable fellow; I could not do such 
              a thing. It is the greatest absurdity--Actually snowing at this 
              moment!-- </p>
            <p>The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home--and 
              the folly of people's not staying comfortably at home when they 
              can! If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any 
              call of duty or business, what a hardship we should deem it;--and 
              here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting 
              forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of 
              nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view or his 
              feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that 
              he can;-- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in 
              another man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not 
              said and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow. 
              Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses 
              and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, 
              shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they 
              might have had at home.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which 
              no doubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the &quot;Very 
              true, my love,&quot; which must have been usually administered by 
              his travelling companion; but she had resolution enough to refrain 
              from making any answer at all. She could not be complying, she dreaded 
              being quarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She allowed 
              him to talk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without 
              opening her lips. <br>
            </p>
            <p>They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down,and Mr. 
              Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma 
              thought with pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all 
              obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities 
              indeed, that she began to think he must have received a different 
              account of Harriet from what had reached her. </p>
            <p>She had sent while dressing, and the answer had been, &quot;Much 
              the same-- not better.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My report from Mrs. Goddard's,&quot; said she presently, 
              &quot;was not so pleasant as I had hoped--`Not better' was my answer.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of 
              sentiment as he answered. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling 
              you that when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very 
              last thing before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith 
              was not better, by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved 
              and concerned-- I had flattered myself that she must be better after 
              such a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma smiled and answered--&quot;My visit was of use to the nervous 
              part of her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore 
              throat; it is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with 
              her, as you probably heard.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow 
              morning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is 
              impossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party 
              to-day!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She will be missed every 
              moment.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really 
              estimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in 
              dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other 
              things, and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What an excellent device,&quot; said he, &quot;the use of 
              a sheepskin for carriages. How very comfortable they make it;--impossible 
              to feel cold with such precautions. The contrivances of modern days 
              indeed have rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete. 
              One is so fenced and guarded from the weather, that not a breath 
              of air can find its way unpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely 
              of no consequence. It is a very cold afternoon--but in this carriage 
              we know nothing of the matter.--Ha! snows a little I see.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said John Knightley, &quot;and I think we shall 
              have a good deal of it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Christmas weather,&quot; observed Mr. Elton. &quot;Quite 
              seasonable; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that 
              it did not begin yesterday, and prevent this day's party, which 
              it might very possibly have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly 
              have ventured had there been much snow on the ground; but now it 
              is of no consequence. This is quite the season indeed for friendly 
              meetings. At Christmas every body invites their friends about them, 
              and people think little of even the worst weather. I was snowed 
              up at a friend's house once for a week. Nothing could be pleasanter. 
              I went for only one night, and could not get away till that very 
              day se'nnight.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, 
              but said only, coolly, <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much 
              astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings. Harriet 
              seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;We are sure of excellent fires,&quot; continued he, &quot;and 
              every thing in the greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. 
              Weston;-- Mrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly 
              what one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;-- it will 
              be a small party, but where small parties are select, they are perhaps 
              the most agreeable of any. Mr. Weston's dining-room does not accommodate 
              more than ten comfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under 
              such circumstances, fall short by two than exceed by two. I think 
              you will agree with me, (turning with a soft air to Emma,) I think 
              I shall certainly have your approbation, though Mr. Knightley perhaps, 
              from being used to the large parties of London, may not quite enter 
              into our feelings.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir--I never 
              dine with any body.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that 
              the law had been so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come 
              when you will be paid for all this, when you will have little labour 
              and great enjoyment.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My first enjoyment,&quot; replied John Knightley, as they 
              passed through the sweep-gate, &quot;will be to find myself safe 
              at Hartfield again.&quot; </p>

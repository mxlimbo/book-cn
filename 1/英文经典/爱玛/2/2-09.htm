            </p>
            <p align="center"> </p>
            <p>Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. The 
              visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and 
              all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified 
              seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. 
              She must have delighted the Coles--worthy people, who deserved to 
              be made happy!--And left a name behind her that would not soon die 
              away. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were 
              two points on which she was not quite easy. She doubted whether 
              she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying 
              her suspicions of Jane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill. It 
              was hardly right; but it had been so strong an idea, that it would 
              escape her, and his submission to all that she told, was a compliment 
              to her penetration, which made it difficult for her to be quite 
              certain that she ought to have held her tongue. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax;and 
              there she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret 
              the inferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most heartily 
              grieve over the idleness of her childhood--and sat down and practised 
              vigorously an hour and a half. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's 
              praise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like 
              her's, than a lamp is like sunshine.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two. I think you 
              play quite as well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear 
              you. Every body last night said how well you played.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. 
              The truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be 
              praised, but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as 
              she does, or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find 
              it out. Mr. Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill 
              talked a great deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much 
              more than execution.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know 
              she had any taste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.-- 
              There is no understanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play 
              so very well, you know, it is no more than she is obliged to do, 
              because she will have to teach. The Coxes were wondering last night 
              whether she would get into any great family. How did you think the 
              Coxes looked?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Just as they always do--very vulgar.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;They told me something,&quot; said Harriet rather hesitatingly;&quot; 
              but it is nothing of any consequence.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful 
              of its producing Mr. Elton. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;They told me---that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He came to their father upon some business, and he asked 
              him to stay to dinner.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. 
              I do not know what she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should 
              go and stay there again next summer.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne 
              Cox should be.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He 
              sat by her at dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would 
              be very glad to marry him.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very likely.--I think they are, without exception, the most 
              vulgar girls in Highbury.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet had business at Ford's.--Emma thought it most prudent to 
              go with her. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, 
              and in her present state, would be dangerous. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was 
              always very long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging 
              over muslins and changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much 
              could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of 
              Highbury;-- Mr. Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting 
              himself in at the office-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning 
              from exercise, or a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were 
              the liveliest objects she could presume to expect; and when her 
              eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray, a tidy old woman travelling 
              homewards from shop with her full basket, two curs quarrelling over 
              a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling children round the baker's 
              little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she knew she had no reason 
              to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough still to stand 
              at the door. A mind lively and at ease, can do with seeing nothing, 
              and can see nothing that does not answer. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons 
              appeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into 
              Highbury;--to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, 
              in the first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer 
              Randalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught 
              their eye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to 
              her; and the agreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give 
              fresh pleasure to the present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her 
              that she was going to call on the Bateses, in order to hear the 
              new instrument. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;For my companion tells me,&quot; said she, &quot;that I absolutely 
              promised Miss Bates last night, that I would come this morning. 
              I was not aware of it myself. I did not know that I had fixed a 
              day, but as he says I did, I am going now.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I 
              hope,&quot; said Frank Churchill, &quot;to join your party and wait 
              for her at Hartfield-- if you are going home.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Weston was disappointed. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much 
              pleased.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps--I may be 
              equally in the way here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not 
              want me. My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping. She says 
              I fidget her to death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could 
              almost say the same. What am I to do?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am here on no business of my own,&quot; said Emma; &quot;I 
              am only waiting for my friend. She will probably have soon done, 
              and then we shall go home. But you had better go with Mrs. Weston 
              and hear the instrument.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well--if you advise it.--But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell 
              should have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to 
              have an indifferent tone--what shall I say? I shall be no support 
              to Mrs. Weston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable 
              truth would be palatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest 
              being in the world at a civil falsehood.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do not believe any such thing,&quot; replied Emma.--&quot;I 
              am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when 
              it is necessary; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument 
              is indifferent.Quite otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's 
              opinion last night.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Do come with me,&quot; said Mrs. Weston, &quot;if it be not 
              very disagreeable to you. It need not detain us long. We will go 
              to Hartfield afterwards. We will follow them to Hartfield. I really 
              wish you to call with me. It will be felt so great an attention! 
              and I always thought you meant it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward 
              him, returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door. Emma watched 
              them in, and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying, 
              with all the force of her own mind, to convince her that if she 
              wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that 
              a blue ribbon, be it ever so beautiful, would still never match 
              her yellow pattern. At last it was all settled, even to the destination 
              of the parcel. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?&quot; asked Mrs. 
              Ford.-- &quot;Yes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown 
              is at Hartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. 
              But then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the 
              pattern gown home any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly-- 
              so it had better go to Hartfield--at least the ribbon. You could 
              make it into two parcels, Mrs. Ford, could not you?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble 
              of two parcels.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No more it is.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No trouble in the world, ma'am,&quot; said the obliging Mrs. 
              Ford. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one.Then, 
              if you please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's-- I do not 
              know--No, I think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent 
              to Hartfield, and take it home with me at night. What do you advise?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That you do not give another half-second to the subject. 
              To Hartfield, if you please, Mrs. Ford.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Aye, that will be much best,&quot; said Harriet, quite satisfied, 
              &quot;I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Voices approached the shop--or rather one voice and two ladies: 
              Mrs. Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My dear Miss Woodhouse,&quot; said the latter, &quot;I am 
              just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down 
              with us a little while, and give us your opinion of our new instrument; 
              you and Miss Smith. How do you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank 
              you.--And I begged Mrs. Weston to come with me, that I might be 
              sure of succeeding.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully 
              well; and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I 
              am so glad to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you 
              were here.-- Oh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss 
              Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come 
              in; my mother will be so very happy to see her--and now we are such 
              a nice party, she cannot refuse.--`Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank 
              Churchill, `Miss Woodhouse's opinion of the instrument will be worth 
              having.'-- But, said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one 
              of you will go with me.--`Oh,' said he, `wait half a minute, till 
              I have finished my job;'--For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, 
              there he is, in the most obliging manner in the world, fastening 
              in the rivet of my mother's spectacles.--The rivet came out, you 
              know, this morning.-- So very obliging!--For my mother had no use 
              of her spectacles-- could not put them on. And, by the bye, every 
              body ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane 
              said so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing 
              I did, but something or other hindered me all the morning; first 
              one thing, then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one 
              time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. 
              Oh, said I, Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is 
              the rivet of your mistress's spectacles out. Then the baked apples 
              came home, Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely 
              civil and obliging to us, the Wallises, always--I have heard some 
              people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude 
              answer, but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention 
              from them. And it cannot be for the value of our custom now, for 
              what is our consumption of bread, you know? Only three of us.-- 
              besides dear Jane at present--and she really eats nothing--makes 
              such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened if you 
              saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so I 
              say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But about 
              the middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she 
              likes so well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, 
              for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I 
              happened to meet him in the street. Not that I had any doubt before-- 
              I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple.I believe 
              it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly 
              wholesome. We have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes 
              an excellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, 
              I hope, and these ladies will oblige us.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma would be &quot;very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &amp;c.,&quot; 
              and they did at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay 
              from Miss Bates than, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see 
              you before. I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons 
              from town. Jane came back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves 
              do very well--only a little too large about the wrist; but Jane 
              is taking them in.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What was I talking of?&quot; said she, beginning again when 
              they were all in the street. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix. <br>

            <p>&quot;I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! 
              my mother's spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! 
              `Oh!' said he, `I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job 
              of this kind excessively.'--Which you know shewed him to be so very. 
              . . . Indeed I must say that, much as I had heard of him before 
              and much as I had expected, he very far exceeds any thing. . . . 
              I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston, most warmly. He seems every 
              thing the fondest parent could. . . . `Oh!' said he, `I can fasten 
              the rivet. I like a job of that sort excessively.' I never shall 
              forget his manner. And when I brought out the baked apples from 
              the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to 
              take some, `Oh!' said he directly, `there is nothing in the way 
              of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking home-baked 
              apples I ever saw in my life.' That, you know, was so very. . . 
              . And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment. Indeed they 
              are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice--only 
              we do not have them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made 
              us promise to have them done three times-- but Miss Woodhouse will 
              be so good as not to mention it. The apples themselves are the very 
              finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell--some of 
              Mr. Knightley's most liberal supply. He sends us a sack every year; 
              and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one 
              of his trees--I believe there is two of them. My mother says the 
              orchard was always famous in her younger days. But I was really 
              quite shocked the other day-- for Mr. Knightley called one morning, 
              and Jane was eating these apples, and we talked about them and said 
              how much she enjoyed them, and he asked whether we were not got 
              to the end of our stock. `I am sure you must be,' said he, `and 
              I will send you another supply; for I have a great many more than 
              I can ever use. William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than 
              usual this year. I will send you some more, before they get good 
              for nothing.' So I begged he would not--for really as to ours being 
              gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left--it 
              was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; 
              and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more, so 
              liberal as he had been already; and Jane said the same. And when 
              he was gone, she almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say 
              quarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was 
              quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; 
              she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left. Oh, 
              said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could. However, the very 
              same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, 
              the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much 
              obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every 
              thing, as you may suppose. William Larkins is such an old acquaintance! 
              I am always glad to see him. But, however, I found afterwards from 
              Patty, that William said it was all the apples of that sort his 
              master had; he had brought them all--and now his master had not 
              one left to bake or boil. William did not seem to mind it himself, 
              he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for William, 
              you know, thinks more of his master's profit than any thing; but 
              Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being all sent 
              away. She could not bear that her master should not be able to have 
              another apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid her 
              not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for 
              Mrs. Hodges would be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks 
              were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty 
              told me, and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have 
              Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the world! He would be 
              so very. . . . I wanted to keep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, 
              I had mentioned it before I was aware.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors 
              walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to, 
              pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will. <br>

            <p>&quot;Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. 
              Pray take care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase-- 
              rather darker and narrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray 
              take care. Miss Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit 
              your foot. Miss Smith, the step at the turning.&quot; </p>

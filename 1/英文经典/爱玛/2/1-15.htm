            <p align="center">CHAPTER XV <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank 
              his tea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his 
              three companions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness 
              of the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was 
              chatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any 
              sort; but at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. 
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. 
              Mrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa. He joined 
              them immediately, and, with scarcely an invitation, seated himself 
              between them. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind 
              by the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget 
              his late improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, 
              and on his making Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen 
              with most friendly smiles. <br>
            </p>
            <p>He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend-- 
              her fair, lovely, amiable friend. &quot;Did she know?--had she heard 
              any thing about her, since their being at Randalls?-- he felt much 
              anxiety--he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed 
              him considerably.&quot; And in this style he talked on for some 
              time very properly, not much attending to any answer, but altogether 
              sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat; and Emma 
              was quite in charity with him. <br>
            </p>
            <p>But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once 
              as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her 
              account, than on Harriet's--more anxious that she should escape 
              the infection, than that there should be no infection in the complaint. 
              He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting 
              the sick-chamber again, for the present--to entreat her to promise 
              him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and 
              learnt his opinion; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring 
              the subject back into its proper course, there was no putting an 
              end to his extreme solicitude about her. She was vexed. It did appear--there 
              was no concealing it--exactly like the pretence of being in love 
              with her, instead of Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most 
              contemptible and abominable! and she had difficulty in behaving 
              with temper. He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore her assistance, 
              &quot;Would not she give him her support?--would not she add her 
              persuasions to his, to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard's 
              till it were certain that Miss Smith's disorder had no infection? 
              He could not be satisfied without a promise-- would not she give 
              him her influence in procuring it?&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;So scrupulous for others,&quot; he continued, &quot;and yet 
              so careless for herself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying 
              at home to-day, and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of 
              catching an ulcerated sore throat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge 
              between us. Have not I some right to complain? I am sure of your 
              kind support and aid.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great, 
              at an address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself 
              the right of first interest in her; and as for herself, she was 
              too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying 
              any thing to the purpose. She could only give him a look; but it 
              was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses, and 
              then left the sofa, removing to a seat by her sister, and giving 
              her all her attention. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly 
              did another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into 
              the room from examining the weather, and opened on them all with 
              the information of the ground being covered with snow, and of its 
              still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with 
              these words to Mr. Woodhouse: <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, 
              sir. Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their 
              way through a storm of snow.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body 
              else had something to say; every body was either surprized or not 
              surprized, and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. 
              Mrs. Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention 
              from his son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I admired your resolution very much, sir,&quot; said he, 
              &quot;in venturing out in such weather, for of course you saw there 
              would be snow very soon. Every body must have seen the snow coming 
              on. I admired your spirit; and I dare say we shall get home very 
              well. Another hour or two's snow can hardly make the road impassable; 
              and we are two carriages; if one is blown over in the bleak part 
              of the common field there will be the other at hand. I dare say 
              we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that 
              he had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, 
              lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse 
              for his hurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen 
              or likely to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; 
              he was afraid they would find no difficulty. He wished the road 
              might be impassable, that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; 
              and with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might 
              be found for every body, calling on his wife to agree with him, 
              that with a little contrivance, every body might be lodged, which 
              she hardly knew how to do, from the consciousness of there being 
              but two spare rooms in the house. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What is to be done, my dear Emma?--what is to be done?&quot; 
              was Mr. Woodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he could say 
              for some time. To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances 
              of safety, her epresentation of the excellence of the horses, and 
              of James, and of their having so many friends about them, revived 
              him a little. <br>
            </p>
            <p>His eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own. The horror of 
              being blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, 
              was full in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just 
              passable for adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no 
              delay, she was eager to have it settled, that her father and Emma 
              should remain at Randalls, while she and her husband set forward 
              instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow 
              that might impede them. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You had better order the carriage directly, my love,&quot; 
              said she; &quot;I dare say we shall be able to get along, if we 
              set off directly; and if we do come to any thing very bad, I can 
              get out and walk. I am not at all afraid. I should not mind walking 
              half the way. I could change my shoes, you know, the moment I got 
              home; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Indeed!&quot; replied he. &quot;Then, my dear Isabella, it 
              is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general 
              every thing does give you cold. Walk home!--you are prettily shod 
              for walking home, I dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. 
              Mrs. Weston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but 
              Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able 
              to get away; and they were still discussing the point, when Mr. 
              Knightley, who had left the room immediately after his brother's 
              first report of the snow, came back again, and told them that he 
              had been out of doors to examine, and could answer for there not 
              being the smallest difficulty in their getting home, whenever they 
              liked it, either now or an hour hence. He had gone beyond the sweep-- 
              some way along the Highbury road--the snow was nowhere above half 
              an inch deep--in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground; 
              a very few flakes were falling at present, but the clouds were parting, 
              and there was every appearance of its being soon over. He had seen 
              the coachmen, and they both agreed with him in there being nothing 
              to apprehend. <br>
            </p>
            <p>To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they 
              were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account, who 
              was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous 
              constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not 
              be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued 
              at Randalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger in 
              returning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was 
              safe to stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending, 
              Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus-- 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am ready, if the others are.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Shall I ring the bell?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, do.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes 
              more, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited 
              in his own house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his 
              temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on 
              such occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley 
              and Mr. Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent 
              some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually 
              fallen, and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been 
              prepared for. &quot;He was afraid they should have a very bad drive. 
              He was afraid poor Isabella would not like it. And there would be 
              poor Emma in the carriage behind. He did not know what they had 
              best do. They must keep as much together as they could;&quot; and 
              James was talked to, and given a charge to go very slow and wait 
              for the other carriage. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting 
              that he did not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very 
              naturally; so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into 
              the second carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully 
              shut on them, and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive. It 
              would not have been the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been 
              rather a pleasure, previous to the suspicions of this very day; 
              she could have talked to him of Harriet, and the three-quarters 
              of a mile would have seemed but one. But now, she would rather it 
              had not happened. She believed he had been drinking too much of 
              Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that he would want to be talking 
              nonsense. <br>
            </p>
            <p>To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was 
              immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity 
              of the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely 
              had they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than 
              she found her subject cut up--her hand seized--her attention demanded, 
              and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself 
              of the precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be 
              already well known, hoping--fearing--adoring--ready to die if she 
              refused him; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and 
              unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having 
              some effect, and in short, very much resolved on being seriously 
              accepted as soon as possible. It really was so. Without scruple--without 
              apology-- without much apparent diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover 
              of Harriet, was professing himself her lover. She tried to stop 
              him; but vainly; he would go on, and say it all. Angry as she was, 
              the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when 
              she did speak. She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness, 
              and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing 
              hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the playful, 
              which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she replied, 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to me! you forget 
              yourself-- you take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith 
              I shall be happy to deliver; but no more of this to me, if you please.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly 
              mean!&quot;-- And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, 
              such boastful pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying 
              with quickness, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I 
              can account for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you 
              could not speak either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command 
              yourself enough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, 
              not at all to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own 
              meaning; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most 
              injurious, and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith 
              as her friend,--but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should 
              be mentioned at all,--he resumed the subject of his own passion, 
              and was very urgent for a favourable answer. <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>As she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his inconstancy 
              and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness, replied, 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made 
              yourself too clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any 
              thing I can express. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during 
              the last month, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I have been in 
              the daily habit of observing--to be addressing me in this manner--this 
              is an unsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed 
              possible! Believe me, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in 
              being the object of such rofessions.&quot; <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Good Heaven!&quot; cried Mr. Elton, &quot;what can be the 
              meaning of this?-- Miss Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in 
              the whole course of my existence--never paid her any attentions, 
              but as your friend: never cared whether she were dead or alive, 
              but as your friend. If she has fancied otherwise, her own wishes 
              have misled her, and I am very sorry--extremely sorry--But, Miss 
              Smith, indeed!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who can think of Miss Smith, 
              when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my honour, there is no unsteadiness 
              of character. <br>
              I have thought only of you. I protest against having paid the smallest 
              attention to any one else. Every thing that I have said or done, 
              for many weeks past, has been with the sole view of marking my adoration 
              of yourself. You cannot really, seriously, doubt it. No!--(in an 
              accent meant to be insinuating)--I am sure you have seen and understood 
              me.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this-- 
              which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too 
              completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two 
              moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine 
              state of mind, he tried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed-- 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting 
              silence. It confesses that you have long understood me.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; cried Emma, &quot;it confesses no such thing. 
              So far from having long understood you, I have been in a most complete 
              error with respect to your views, till this moment. As to myself, 
              I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings-- 
              Nothing could be farther from my wishes--your attachment to my friend 
              Harriet--your pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great 
              pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success: but 
              had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield, I 
              should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits 
              so frequent. Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend 
              yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought 
              seriously of her?&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Never, madam,&quot; cried he, affronted in his turn: &quot;never, 
              I assure you. I think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a 
              very good sort of girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably 
              settled. I wish her extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men 
              who might not object to--Every body has their level: but as for 
              myself, I am not, I think, quite so much at a loss. I need not so 
              totally despair of an equal alliance, as to be addressing myself 
              to Miss Smith!-- No, madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for 
              yourself only; and the encouragement I received--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have 
              been entirely mistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as 
              the admirer of my friend. In no other light could you have been 
              more to me than a common acquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but 
              it is well that the mistake ends where it does. Had the same behaviour 
              continued, Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of 
              your views; not being aware, probably, any more than myself, of 
              the very great inequality which you are so sensible of. But, as 
              it is, the disappointment is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting. 
              I have no thoughts of matrimony at present.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to 
              invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and 
              mutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few 
              minutes longer, for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them 
              to a foot-pace. If there had not been so much anger, there would 
              have been desperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions 
              left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing 
              when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, 
              they found themselves, all at once, at the door of his house; and 
              he was out before another syllable passed.--Emma then felt it indispensable 
              to wish him a good night. The compliment was just returned, coldly 
              and proudly; and, under indescribable irritation of spirits, she 
              was then conveyed to Hartfield. <br>
            </p>
            <p>There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, 
              who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from 
              Vicarage Lane--turning a corner which he could never bear to think 
              of-- and in strange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and 
              there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every 
              thing go well: for Mr. John Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, 
              was now all kindness and attention; and so particularly solicitous 
              for the comfort of her father, as to seem--if not quite ready to 
              join him in a basin of gruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly 
              wholesome; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all 
              their little party, except herself.--But her mind had never been 
              in such perturbation; and it needed a very strong effort to appear 
              attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed 
              her the relief of quiet reflection. </p>

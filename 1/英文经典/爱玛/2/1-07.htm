              VOLUME I<br>
            </p>
            <p align="center">CHAPTER VII <br>
            </p>
            <p>The very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh occasion 
              for Emma's services towards her friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield, 
              as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home 
              to return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been 
              talked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something 
              extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. Half 
              a minute brought it all out. She had heard, as soon as she got back 
              to Mrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, 
              and finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had 
              left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; 
              and on opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the 
              two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; 
              and this letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct 
              proposal of marriage. &quot;Who could have thought it? She was so 
              surprized she did not know what to do. Yes, quite a proposal of 
              marriage; and a very good letter, at least she thought so. And he 
              wrote as if he really loved her very much--but she did not know--and 
              so, she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what 
              she should do.--&quot; Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming 
              so pleased and so doubtful. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Upon my word,&quot; she cried, &quot;the young man is determined 
              not to lose any thing for want of asking. He will connect himself 
              well if he can.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Will you read the letter?&quot; cried Harriet. &quot;Pray 
              do. I'd rather you would.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. 
              The style of the letter was much above her expectation. There were 
              not merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would 
              not have disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was 
              strong and unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much 
              to the credit of the writer. It was short, but expressed good sense, 
              warm attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. 
              She paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her 
              opinion, with a &quot;Well, well,&quot; and was at last forced to 
              add, &quot;Is it a good letter? or is it too short?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, indeed, a very good letter,&quot; replied Emma rather 
              slowly--&quot;so good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, 
              I think one of his sisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine 
              the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express 
              himself so well, if left quite to his own powers, and yet it is 
              not the style of a woman; no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; 
              not diffuse enough for a woman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and 
              I suppose may have a natural talent for--thinks strongly and clearly--and 
              when he takes a pen in hand, his thoughts naturally find proper 
              words. It is so with some men. Yes, I understand the sort of mind. 
              Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain point, not coarse. 
              A better written letter, Harriet (returning it,) than I had expected.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the still waiting Harriet;--&quot; well--and-- 
              and what shall I do?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard 
              to this letter?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course--and 
              speedily.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise 
              me.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You 
              will express yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger 
              of your not being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning 
              must be unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of 
              gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety 
              requires, will present themselves unbidden to your mind, I am persuaded. 
              You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow 
              for his disappointment.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You think I ought to refuse him then,&quot; said Harriet, 
              looking down. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are 
              you in any doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps 
              I have been under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding 
              you, if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer. I had 
              imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued: 
              &quot;You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What 
              would you advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what 
              I ought to do.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing 
              to do with it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I had no notion that he liked me so very much,&quot; said 
              Harriet, contemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered 
              in her silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery 
              of that letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say, 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman 
              doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly 
              ought to refuse him. If she can hesitate as to `Yes,' she ought 
              to say `No' directly. It is not a state to be safely entered into 
              with doubtful feelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty 
              as a friend, and older than yourself, to say thus much to you. But 
              do not imagine that I want to influence you.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if 
              you would just advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean 
              that--As you say, one's mind ought to be quite made up--One should 
              not be hesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer 
              to say `No,' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say `No?'&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Not for the world,&quot; said Emma, smiling graciously, &quot;would 
              I advise you either way. You must be the best judge of your own 
              happiness. If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you 
              think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with, 
              why should you hesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else 
              occur to you at this moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, 
              do not deceive yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and 
              compassion. At this moment whom are you thinking of?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned 
              away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the 
              letter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about 
              without regard. Emma waited the result with impatience, but not 
              without strong hopes. At last, with some hesitation, Harriet said-- 
              <br>
              &quot;Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must 
              do as well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, 
              and really almost made up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you 
              think I am right?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing 
              just what you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my 
              feelings to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I 
              have no hesitation in approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy 
              of this. It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which 
              must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While 
              you were in the smallest degree wavering, I said nothing about it, 
              because I would not influence; but it would have been the loss of 
              a friend to me. I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of 
              Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am secure of you for ever.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck 
              her forcibly. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;You could not have visited me!&quot; she cried, looking aghast. 
              &quot;No, to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that 
              before. That would have been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear 
              Miss Woodhouse,I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being 
              intimate with you for any thing in the world.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose 
              you; but it must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of 
              all good society. I must have given you up.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it! It would have 
              killed me never to come to Hartfield any more!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Dear affectionate creature!--You banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--You 
              confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! 
              I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He 
              must have a pretty good opinion of himself.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I do not think he is conceited either, in general,&quot; said 
              Harriet, her conscience opposing such censure; &quot;at least, he 
              is very good natured, and I shall always feel much obliged to him, 
              and have a great regard for-- but that is quite a different thing 
              from--and you know, though he may like me, it does not follow that 
              I should--and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here 
              I have seen people--and if one comes to compare them, person and 
              manners, there is no comparison at all, one is so very handsome 
              and agreeable. However, I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable 
              young man, and have a great opinion of him; and his being so much 
              attached to me--and his writing such a letter--but as to leaving 
              you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will 
              not be parted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she 
              is asked, or because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable 
              letter.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a &quot;very 
              true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish 
              manner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know 
              that her husband could write a good letter.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to 
              be always happy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined 
              to refuse him. But how shall I do? That shall I say?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and 
              advised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the 
              hope of her assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against 
              any assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation 
              of every sentence. The looking over his letter again, in replying 
              to it, had such a softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary 
              to brace her up with a few decisive expressions; and she was so 
              very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy, and thought 
              so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say, o anxious 
              that they should not fancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if 
              the young man had come in her way at that moment, he would have 
              been accepted after all. <br>
              <br>
              This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business 
              was finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, 
              but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved 
              them by speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward 
              the idea of Mr. Elton. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,&quot; was said 
              in rather a sorrowful tone. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my 
              Harriet. You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared 
              to Abbey-Mill.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never 
              happy but at Hartfield.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Some time afterwards it was, &quot;I think Mrs. Goddard would be 
              very much surprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss 
              Nash would--for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, 
              and it is only a linen-draper.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in 
              the teacher of a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy 
              you such an opportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest 
              would appear valuable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for 
              you, I suppose she is quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain 
              person can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto 
              I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners 
              have explained themselves.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering 
              that people should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly 
              cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again 
              towards the rejected Mr. Martin. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Now he has got my letter,&quot; said she softly. &quot;I 
              wonder what they are all doing--whether his sisters know--if he 
              is unhappy, they will be unhappy too. I hope he will not mind it 
              so very much.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more 
              cheerfully employed,&quot; cried Emma. &quot;At this moment, perhaps, 
              Mr. Elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters, telling 
              how much more beautiful is the original, and after being asked for 
              it five or six times, allowing them to hear your name, your own 
              dear name.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond-street.&quot; 
              <br>
              &quot;Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear 
              little modest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in 
              Bond-street till just before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is 
              his companion all this evening, his solace, his delight. It opens 
              his designs to his family, it introduces you among them, it diffuses 
              through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature, eager 
              curiosity and warm prepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how 
              suspicious, how busy their imaginations all are!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger. </p>

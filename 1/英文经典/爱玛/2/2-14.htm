              VOLUME II <br>

            <p align="center">CHAPTER XIV </p>
            <p align="center"> </p>
            <p>Mrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might 
              be interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a 
              pew, and it must be left for the visits in form which were then 
              to be paid, to settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only 
              rather pretty, or not pretty at all. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, 
              to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and 
              she made a point of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of 
              the business might be gone through as soon as possible. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room 
              to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months 
              ago, to lace up her boot, without recollecting. A thousand vexatious 
              thoughts would recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; 
              and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting 
              too; but she behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent. 
              The visit was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment 
              and occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow 
              herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady, and on no account 
              to give one, beyond the nothing-meaning terms of being &quot;elegantly 
              dressed, and very pleasing.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>She did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to find 
              fault, but she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but 
              not elegance.-- She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, 
              a bride, there was too much ease. Her person was rather good; her 
              face not unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor 
              manner, were elegant. Emma thought at least it would turn out so. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear--but no, she would 
              not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. 
              It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, 
              and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. 
              The woman was better off; she might have the assistance of fine 
              clothes, and the privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only 
              his own good sense to depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly 
              unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with 
              the woman he had just married, the woman he had wanted to marry, 
              and the woman whom he had been expected to marry, she must allow 
              him to have the right to look as little wise, and to be as much 
              affectedly, and as little really easy as could be. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, Miss Woodhouse,&quot; said Harriet, when they had quitted 
              the house, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; &quot;Well, 
              Miss Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?-- 
              Is not she very charming?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty 
              fortune; and she came in his way.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I dare say,&quot; returned Harriet, sighing again, &quot;I 
              dare say she was very much attached to him.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry 
              the woman who loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, 
              and thought this the best offer she was likely to have.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Harriet earnestly, &quot;and well she might, 
              nobody could ever have a better. Well, I wish them happy with all 
              my heart. And now, Miss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing 
              them again. He is just as superior as ever;--but being married, 
              you know, it is quite a different thing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, 
              you need not be afraid; I can sit and admire him now without any 
              great misery. To know that he has not thrown himself away, is such 
              a comfort!-- She does seem a charming young woman, just what he 
              deserves. Happy creature! He called her `Augusta.' How delightful!&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could then 
              see more and judge better. From Harriet's happening not to be at 
              Hartfield, and her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton, she 
              had a quarter of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself, 
              and could composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite 
              convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied 
              with herself, and thinking much of her own importance; that she 
              meant to shine and be very superior, but with manners which had 
              been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all her notions 
              were drawn from one set of people, and one style of living; that 
              if not foolish she was ignorant, and that her society would certainly 
              do Mr. Elton no good. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined 
              herself, she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss 
              Hawkins, it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had 
              been the best of her own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol 
              was the pride of the alliance, and his place and his carriages were 
              the pride of him. </p>
            <p>The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, &quot;My 
              brother Mr. Suckling's seat;&quot;--a comparison of Hartfield to 
              Maple Grove. The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; 
              and the house was modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most 
              favourably impressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and 
              all that she could see or imagine. &quot;Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She 
              was quite struck by the likeness!--That room was the very shape 
              and size of the morning-room at Maple Grove; her sister's favourite 
              room.&quot;-- Mr. Elton was appealed to.--&quot;Was not it astonishingly 
              like?-- She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how 
              very like the staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of 
              the house. I really could not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss 
              Woodhouse, it is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place 
              I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove. I have spent so many 
              happy months there! (with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming 
              place, undoubtedly. Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty; 
              but to me, it has been quite a home. Whenever you are transplanted, 
              like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful 
              it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind. 
              I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient 
              for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house-- 
              the grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly 
              like. The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, 
              and stand very much in the same way--just across the lawn; and I 
              had a glimpse of a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which 
              put me so exactly in mind! My brother and sister will be enchanted 
              with this place. People who have extensive grounds themselves are 
              always pleased with any thing in the same style.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea 
              that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little 
              for the extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth 
              while to attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said 
              in reply, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you 
              will think you have overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, 
              you know. Surry is the garden of England.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. 
              Many counties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well 
              as Surry.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I fancy not,&quot; replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied 
              smile.&quot; I never heard any county but Surry called so.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma was silenced. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, 
              or summer at farthest,&quot; continued Mrs. Elton; &quot;and that 
              will be our time for exploring. While they are with us, we shall 
              explore a great deal, I dare say. They will have their barouche-landau, 
              of course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying 
              any thing of our carriage, we should be able to explore the different 
              beauties extremely well. They would hardly come in their chaise, 
              I think, at that season of the year. Indeed, when the time draws 
              on, I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau; 
              it will be so very much preferable. When people come into a beautiful 
              country of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes 
              them to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond 
              of exploring. We explored to King's-Weston twice last summer, in 
              that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the barouche-landau. 
              You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, 
              every summer?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of 
              the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you 
              speak of; and we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more 
              disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. 
              Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb 
              for it at Maple Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has 
              been going to Bristol, `I really cannot get this girl to move from 
              the house. I absolutely must go in by myself, though I hate being 
              stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion; but Augusta, 
              I believe, with her own good-will, would never stir beyond the park 
              paling.' Many a time has she said so; and yet I am no advocate for 
              entire seclusion. I think, on the contrary, when people shut themselves 
              up entirely from society, it is a very bad thing; and that it is 
              much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree, without 
              living in it either too much or too little. I perfectly understand 
              your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse-- (looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), 
              Your father's state of health must be a great drawback. Why does 
              not he try Bath?--Indeed he should. Let me recommend Bath to you. 
              I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without 
              receiving any benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is 
              not unknown to you, does not conceive it would be at all more likely 
              to be useful now.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, 
              where the waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they 
              give. In my Bath life, I have seen such instances of it! And it 
              is so cheerful a place, that it could not fail of being of use to 
              Mr. Woodhouse's spirits, which, I understand, are sometimes much 
              depressed. And as to its recommendations to you, I fancy I need 
              not take much pains to dwell on them. The advantages of Bath to 
              the young are pretty generally understood. It would be a charming 
              introduction for you, who have lived so secluded a life; and I could 
              immediately secure you some of the best society in the place. A 
              line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance; and 
              my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have always resided 
              with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any attentions, 
              and would be the very person for you to go into public with.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The 
              idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an 
              introduction--of her going into public under the auspices of a friend 
              of Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with 
              the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!-- The dignity 
              of Miss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed! <br>
            </p>
            <p>She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could 
              have given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; &quot;but their 
              going to Bath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly 
              convinced that the place might suit her better than her father.&quot; 
              And then, to prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the 
              subject directly. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these 
              occasions, a lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury 
              has long known that you are a superior performer.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior 
              performer!--very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial 
              a quarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of music--passionately 
              fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste; but 
              as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is mediocre 
              to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully. 
              I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and 
              delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got into. I absolutely 
              cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life to me; and having 
              always been used to a very musical society, both at Maple Grove 
              and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I honestly 
              said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home, and 
              expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable; 
              and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had been accustomed 
              to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension. </p>
            <p>When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that the 
              world I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear 
              of retirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the 
              world was not necessary to me. I could do very well without it. 
              To those who had no resources it was a different thing; but my resources 
              made me quite independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I 
              had been used to, I really could not give it a thought. I hoped 
              I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description. Certainly 
              I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did 
              assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness,nor 
              were spacious apartments. `But,' said I, `to be quite honest, I 
              do not think I can live without something of a musical society. 
              I condition for nothing else; but without music, life would be a 
              blank to me.'&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;We cannot suppose,&quot; said Emma, smiling, &quot;that Mr. 
              Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a very musical 
              society in Highbury; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped 
              the truth more than may be pardoned, in consideration of the motive.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted 
              to find myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet 
              little concerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must 
              establish a musical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your 
              house, or ours. Will not it be a good plan? If we exert ourselves, 
              I think we shall not be long in want of allies. Something of that 
              nature would be particularly desirable for me, as an inducement 
              to keep me in practice; for married women, you know-- there is a 
              sad story against them, in general. They are but too apt to give 
              up music.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can be no 
              danger, surely?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I should hope not; but really when I look around among my 
              acquaintance, I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music--never 
              touches the instrument--though she played sweetly. And the same 
              may be said of Mrs. Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of 
              the two Milmans, now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more 
              than I can enumerate. Upon my word it is enough to put one in a 
              fright. I used to be quite angry with Selina; but really I begin 
              now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her 
              attention. I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with 
              my housekeeper.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But every thing of that kind,&quot; said Emma, &quot;will 
              soon be in so regular a train--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Mrs. Elton, laughing, &quot;we shall see.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had 
              nothing more to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton chose 
              another subject. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;We have been calling at Randalls,&quot; said she, &quot;and 
              found them both at home; and very pleasant people they seem to be. 
              I like them extremely. Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature-- 
              quite a first-rate favourite with me already, I assure you. And 
              she appears so truly good--there is something so motherly and kind-hearted 
              about her, that it wins upon one directly. She was your governess, 
              I think?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly 
              waited for the affirmative before she went on. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find 
              her so very lady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mrs. Weston's manners,&quot; said Emma, &quot;were always 
              particularly good. Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would 
              make them the safest model for any young woman.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And who do you think came in while we were there?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance-- 
              and how could she possibly guess? <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Knightley!&quot; continued Mrs. Elton; &quot;Knightley himself!--Was 
              not it lucky?--for, not being within when he called the other day, 
              I had never seen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend 
              of Mr. E.'s, I had a great curiosity. `My friend Knightley' had 
              been so often mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; 
              and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not 
              be ashamed of his friend. Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like 
              him very much. Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Happily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma could 
              breathe. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Insufferable woman!&quot; was her immediate exclamation. 
              &quot;Worse than I had supposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!--I 
              could not have believed it. Knightley!--never seen him in her life 
              before, and call him Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman! 
              A little upstart, vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her caro sposo, 
              and her resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred 
              finery. Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! 
              I doubt whether he will return the compliment, and discover her 
              to be a lady. I could not have believed it! And to propose that 
              she and I should unite to form a musical club! One would fancy we 
              were bosom friends! And Mrs. Weston!-- Astonished that the person 
              who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman! Worse and worse. 
              I never met with her equal. Much beyond my hopes. Harriet is disgraced 
              by any comparison. Oh! what would Frank Churchill say to her, if 
              he were here? How angry and how diverted he would be! Ah! there 
              I am-- thinking of him directly. Always the first person to be thought 
              of! How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comes as regularly into 
              my mind!&quot;-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time her 
              father had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons' departure, 
              and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, my dear,&quot; he deliberately began, &quot;considering 
              we never saw her before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; 
              and I dare say she was very much pleased with you. She speaks a 
              little too quick. A little quickness of voice there is which rather 
              hurts the ear. But I believe I am nice; I do not like strange voices; 
              and nobody speaks like you and poor Miss Taylor. However, she seems 
              a very obliging, pretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make 
              him a very good wife. Though I think he had better not have married. 
              I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait 
              on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion; I said that I hoped 
              I should in the course of the summer. But I ought to have gone before. 
              Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss. Ah! it shews what a sad 
              invalid I am! But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows 
              you.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes: but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects 
              to her if possible. It was being very deficient.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore 
              why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride? It 
              ought to be no recommendation to you. It is encouraging people to 
              marry if you make so much of them.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I 
              would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a 
              bride, especially, is never to be neglected. More is avowedly due 
              to her. A bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company, 
              let the others be who they may.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not 
              know what is. And I should never have expected you to be lending 
              your sanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere 
              common politeness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with 
              any encouragement to people to marry.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma had done. Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand 
              her. Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton's offences, and long, very 
              long, did they occupy her. </p>

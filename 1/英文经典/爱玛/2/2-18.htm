            <p>&quot;I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son 
              to you,&quot; said Mr. Weston. <br>
              <br>
              Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended 
              her by such a hope, smiled most graciously. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,&quot; 
              he continued-- &quot;and know him to be my son, though he does not 
              bear my name.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I 
              am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall 
              both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy, I 
              am sure.-- He is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have 
              notice of it in a letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this 
              morning, and seeing my son's hand, presumed to open it--though it 
              was not directed to me--it was to Mrs. Weston. She is his principal 
              correspondent, I assure you. I hardly ever get a letter.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! 
              Mr. Weston-- (laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.--A 
              most dangerous precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours 
              follow your example.--Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, 
              we married women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh! Mr. Weston, 
              I could not have believed it of you!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, 
              Mrs. Elton.--This letter tells us--it is a short letter--written 
              in a hurry, merely to give us notice--it tells us that they are 
              all coming up to town directly, on Mrs. Churchill's account--she 
              has not been well the whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold 
              for her-- so they are all to move southward without loss of time.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Indeed!--from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London. 
              a considerable journey.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther 
              than from Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, 
              to people of large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my 
              brother, Mr. Suckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe 
              me-- but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and 
              back again with four horses.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;The evil of the distance from Enscombe,&quot; said Mr. Weston, 
              &quot;is, that Mrs. Churchill, as we understand, has not been able 
              to leave the sofa for a week together. In Frank's last letter she 
              complained, he said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory 
              without having both his arm and his uncle's! This, you know, speaks 
              a great degree of weakness--but now she is so impatient to be in 
              town, that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank 
              writes word. Certainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinary 
              constitutions, Mrs. Elton. You must grant me that.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I Always take the 
              part of my own sex. I do indeed. I give you notice--You will find 
              me a formidable antagonist on that point. I always stand up for 
              women-- and I assure you, if you knew how Selina feels with respect 
              to sleeping at an inn, you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's 
              making incredible exertions to avoid it. Selina says it is quite 
              horror to her--and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety. 
              She always travels with her own sheets; an excellent precaution. 
              Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any 
              other fine lady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any 
              lady in the land for&quot;-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with, <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, 
              I assure you. Do not run away with such an idea.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Is not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is 
              as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so 
              warmly. It was by no means her object to have it believed that her 
              sister was not a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in 
              the pretence of it;--and she was considering in what way she had 
              best retract, when Mr. Weston went on. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may 
              suspect-- but this is quite between ourselves. She is very fond 
              of Frank, and therefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she 
              is out of health now; but that indeed, by her own account, she has 
              always been. I would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I 
              have not much faith in Mrs. Churchill's illness.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To 
              Bath, or to Clifton?&quot; &quot;She has taken it into her head 
              that Enscombe is too cold for her. The fact is, I suppose, that 
              she is tired of Enscombe. She has now been a longer time stationary 
              there, than she ever was before, and she begins to want change. 
              It is a retired place. A fine place, but very retired.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Aye--like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more 
              retired from the road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation 
              all round it! You seem shut out from every thing--in the most complete 
              retirement.-- And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits 
              like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she may 
              not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country 
              life. I always say a woman cannot have too many resources--and I 
              feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent 
              of society.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Frank was here in February for a fortnight.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;So I remember to have heard. He will find an addition to 
              the society of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume 
              to call myself an addition. But perhaps he may never have heard 
              of there being such a creature in the world.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr. 
              Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing 
              possible. Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston's letters lately 
              have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He had done his duty and could return to his son. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;When Frank left us,&quot; continued he, &quot;it was quite 
              uncertain when we might see him again, which makes this day's news 
              doubly welcome. It has been completely unexpected. That is, I always 
              had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon, I was sure 
              something favourable would turn up--but nobody believed me. He and 
              Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully desponding. `How could he contrive 
              to come? And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would 
              spare him again?' and so forth--I always felt that something would 
              happen in our favour; and so it has, you see. I have observed, Mrs. 
              Elton, in the course of my life, that if things are going untowardly 
              one month, they are sure to mend the next.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I 
              used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, 
              when, because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with 
              all the rapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in 
              despair,and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be May 
              before Hymen's saffron robe would be put on for us. Oh! the pains 
              I have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller 
              views! The carriage--we had disappointments about the carriage;--one 
              morning, I remember, he came to me quite in despair.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly 
              seized the opportunity of going on. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. 
              Churchill is ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer 
              place than Enscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have 
              the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring-- 
              precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for 
              it: days almost at the longest; weather genial and pleasant, always 
              inviting one out, and never too hot for exercise. When he was here 
              before, we made the best of it; but there was a good deal of wet, 
              damp, cheerless weather; there always is in February, you know, 
              and we could not do half that we intended. Now will be the time. 
              This will be complete enjoyment; and I do not know, Mrs. Elton, 
              whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the sort of constant expectation 
              there will be of his coming in to-day or to-morrow, and at any hour, 
              may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in 
              the house. I think it is so. I think it is the state of mind which 
              gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be pleased with my 
              son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generally thought 
              a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy.Mrs. Weston's partiality 
              for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, most gratifying 
              to me. She thinks nobody equal to him.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that 
              my opinion will be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much 
              in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair to 
              observe, that I am one of those who always judge for themselves, 
              and are by no means implicitly guided by others. I give you notice 
              that as I find your son, so I shall judge of him.--I am no flatterer.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Weston was musing. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I hope,&quot; said he presently, &quot;I have not been severe 
              upon poor Mrs. Churchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do 
              her injustice; but there are some traits in her character which 
              make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I 
              could wish. You cannot be ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion 
              with the family, nor of the treatment I have met with; and, between 
              ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid to her. She was the 
              instigator. Frank's mother would never have been slighted as she 
              was but for her. Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride is nothing 
              to his wife's: his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride 
              that would harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless 
              and tiresome; but her pride is arrogance and insolence! And what 
              inclines one less to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or 
              blood. She was nobody when he married her, barely the daughter of 
              a gentleman; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she 
              has out-Churchill'd them all in high and mighty claims: but in herself, 
              I assure you, she is an upstart.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have 
              quite a horror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough 
              disgust to people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood 
              who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs 
              they give themselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me 
              think of them directly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately 
              settled there, and encumbered with many low connexions, but giving 
              themselves immense airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the 
              old established families. A year and a half is the very utmost that 
              they can have lived at West Hall; and how they got their fortune 
              nobody knows. They came from Birmingham, which is not a place to 
              promise much, you know, Mr. Weston. One has not great hopes from 
              Birmingham. I always say there is something direful in the sound: 
              but nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans, though a good 
              many things I assure you are suspected; and yet by their manners 
              they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother, Mr. Suckling, 
              who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours. It is infinitely 
              too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven years a resident at Maple 
              Grove, and whose father had it before him--I believe, at least--I 
              am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase 
              before his death.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>They were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, 
              having said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking 
              away. <br>
            </p>
            <p>After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr. 
              Woodhouse to cards. The remaining five were left to their own powers, 
              and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed 
              little disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, 
              which nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry 
              of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was 
              to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say 
              about the boys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing 
              is down at full length there we may be sure. My charge would be 
              much more concise than her's, and probably not much in the same 
              spirit; all that I have to recommend being comprised in, do not 
              spoil them, and do not physic them.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I rather hope to satisfy you both,&quot; said Emma, &quot;for 
              I shall do all in my power to make them happy, which will be enough 
              for Isabella; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home 
              again.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That is very likely. You think so, do not you?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father-- 
              or even may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements 
              continue to increase as much as they have done lately.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Increase!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has 
              made a great difference in your way of life.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Difference! No indeed I am not.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with 
              company than you used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come 
              down for only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!-- 
              When did it happen before, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood 
              is increasing, and you mix more with it. A little while ago, every 
              letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties; dinners 
              at Mr. Cole's, or balls at the Crown. The difference which Randalls, 
              Randalls alone makes in your goings-on, is very great.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said his brother quickly, &quot;it is Randalls 
              that does it all.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have 
              less influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, 
              Emma, that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they 
              are, I only beg you to send them home.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No,&quot; cried Mr. Knightley, &quot;that need not be the 
              consequence. Let them be sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at 
              leisure.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Upon my word,&quot; exclaimed Emma, &quot;you amuse me! I 
              should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take 
              place without your being of the party; and why I am to be supposed 
              in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys. These 
              amazing engagements of mine-- what have they been? Dining once with 
              the Coles--and having a ball talked of, which never took place. 
              I can understand you--(nodding at Mr. John Knightley)--your good 
              fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here, delights 
              you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning to Mr. Knightley,) 
              who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield, 
              why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, I cannot 
              imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that if Aunt 
              Emma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much 
              better with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five 
              hours where she is absent one-- and who, when he is at home, is 
              either reading to himself or settling his accounts.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without 
              difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him. </p>

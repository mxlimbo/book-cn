            <p>Emma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken 
              the following day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely 
              to have his hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at 
              breakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to 
              return to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared 
              than having his hair cut. There was certainly no harm in his travelling 
              sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air 
              of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve. It did 
              not accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, 
              or even the unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself 
              to discern in him yesterday. Vanity, extravagance, love of change, 
              restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad; 
              heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston, indifferent 
              as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became liable 
              to all these charges. His father only called him a coxcomb, and 
              thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like 
              it, was clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible, 
              and making no other comment than that &quot;all young people would 
              have their little whims.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit 
              hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston 
              was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he 
              made himself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. 
              He appeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful 
              and lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, 
              a great deal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, 
              was fond of talking of him--said he would be the best man in the 
              world if he were left to himself; and though there was no being 
              attached to the aunt, he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude, 
              and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect. This was 
              all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate fancy for having 
              his hair cut, there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished 
              honour which her imagination had given him; the honour, if not of 
              being really in love with her, of being at least very near it, and 
              saved only by her own indifference-- (for still her resolution held 
              of never marrying)--the honour, in short, of being marked out for 
              her by all their joint acquaintance. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must 
              have some weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired her 
              extremely--thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with 
              so much to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge 
              him harshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, &quot;all young people would 
              have their little whims.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so 
              leniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes 
              of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances 
              were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man-- 
              one who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit 
              among them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows 
              or smiles--Mr. Knightley. The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; 
              for the moment, he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately 
              afterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand, 
              &quot;Hum! just the trifling, silly fellow I took him for.&quot; 
              She had half a mind to resent; but an instant's observation convinced 
              her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings, and 
              not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and 
              Mrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularly 
              opportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make 
              Emma want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted 
              exactly the advice they gave. <br>
            </p>
            <p>This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years 
              in Highbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal, 
              and unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, 
              in trade, and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into 
              the country, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, 
              keeping little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last 
              year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means-- 
              the house in town had yielded greater profits, and fortune in general 
              had smiled on them. With their wealth, their views increased; their 
              want of a larger house, their inclination for more company. They 
              added to their house, to their number of servants, to their expenses 
              of every sort; and by this time were, in fortune and style of living, 
              second only to the family at Hartfield. Their love of society, and 
              their new dining-room, prepared every body for their keeping dinner-company; 
              and a few parties, chiefly among the single men, had already taken 
              place. The regular and best families Emma could hardly suppose they 
              would presume to invite-- neither Donwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls. 
              Nothing should tempt her to go, if they did; and she regretted that 
              her father's known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning 
              than she could wish. The Coles were very respectable in their way, 
              but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange 
              the terms on which the superior families would visit them. This 
              lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only from herself; 
              she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston. <br>
            </p>
            <p>But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many 
              weeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it 
              found her very differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received 
              their invitation, and none had come for her father and herself; 
              and Mrs. Weston's accounting for it with &quot;I suppose they will 
              not take the liberty with you; they know you do not dine out,&quot; 
              was not quite sufficient. She felt that she should like to have 
              had the power of refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party 
              to be assembled there, consisting precisely of those whose society 
              was dearest to her, occurred again and again, she did not know that 
              she might not have been tempted to accept. Harriet was to be there 
              in the evening, and the Bateses. They had been speaking of it as 
              they walked about Highbury the day before, and Frank Churchill had 
              most earnestly lamented her absence. Might not the evening end in 
              a dance? had been a question of his. The bare possibility of it 
              acted as a farther irritation on her spirits; and her being left 
              in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to be intended 
              as a compliment, was but poor comfort. <br>
            </p>
            <p>It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were 
              at Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though 
              her first remark, on reading it, was that &quot;of course it must 
              be declined,&quot; she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they 
              advised her to do, that their advice for her going was most prompt 
              and successful. <br>
              <br>
              She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely 
              without inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves 
              so properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it-- 
              so much consideration for her father. &quot;They would have solicited 
              the honour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen 
              from London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any 
              draught of air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give 
              them the honour of his company. &quot;Upon the whole, she was very 
              persuadable; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it 
              might be done without neglecting his comfort--how certainly Mrs. 
              Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might be depended on for bearing him 
              company-- Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of 
              his daughter's going out to dinner on a day now near at hand, and 
              spending the whole evening away from him. As for his going, Emma 
              did not wish him to think it possible, the hours would be too late, 
              and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty well resigned. <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am not fond of dinner-visiting,&quot; said he--&quot;I 
              never was. </p>
            <p>No more is Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. 
              and Mrs. Cole should have done it. I think it would be much better 
              if they would come in one afternoon next summer, and take their 
              tea with us--take us in their afternoon walk; which they might do, 
              as our hours are so reasonable, and yet get home without being out 
              in the damp of the evening. The dews of a summer evening are what 
              I would not expose any body to. However, as they are so very desirous 
              to have dear Emma dine with them, and as you will both be there, 
              and Mr. Knightley too, to take care of her, I cannot wish to prevent 
              it, provided the weather be what it ought, neither damp, nor cold, 
              nor windy.&quot; Then turning to Mrs. Weston, with a look of gentle 
              reproach--&quot;Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not married, you would 
              have staid at home with me.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, sir,&quot; cried Mr. Weston, &quot;as I took Miss Taylor 
              away, it is incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I 
              will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment, if you wish it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>But the idea of any thing to be done in a moment, was increasing, 
              not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation. The ladies knew better 
              how to allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately 
              arranged. <br>
              <br>
              With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for 
              talking as usual. &quot;He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. 
              He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a 
              line, and invite her. James could take the note. But first of all, 
              there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. 
              You will say that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore 
              must decline their obliging invitation; beginning with my compliments, 
              of course. But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you 
              what is to be done. We must remember to let James know that the 
              carriage will be wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you 
              with him. We have never been there above once since the new approach 
              was made; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very 
              safely. And when you get there, you must tell him at what time you 
              would have him come for you again; and you had better name an early 
              hour. You will not like staying late. You will get very tired when 
              tea is over.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, 
              papa?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be 
              a great many people talking at once. You will not like the noise.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But, my dear sir,&quot; cried Mr. Weston, &quot;if Emma comes 
              away early, it will be breaking up the party.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And no great harm if it does,&quot; said Mr. Woodhouse. &quot;The 
              sooner every party breaks up, the better.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma's 
              going away directly after tea might be giving offence. They are 
              good-natured people, and think little of their own claims; but still 
              they must feel that any body's hurrying away is no great compliment; 
              and Miss Woodhouse's doing it would be more thought of than any 
              other person's in the room. You would not wish to disappoint and 
              mortify the Coles, I am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people 
              as ever lived, and who have been your neighbours these ten years.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged 
              to you for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving 
              them any pain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me 
              that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor. You would not think it 
              to look at him, but he is bilious--Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, 
              I would not be the means of giving them any pain. My dear Emma, 
              we must consider this. I am sure, rather than run the risk of hurting 
              Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a little longer than you might 
              wish. You will not regard being tired. You will be perfectly safe, 
              you know, among your friends.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should 
              have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your 
              account. I am only afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid 
              of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She 
              loves piquet, you know; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you 
              will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going to bed at your 
              usual time--and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort. 
              You must promise me not to sit up.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as 
              that, if she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; 
              if hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid 
              should sit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see 
              that every thing were safe in the house, as usual. </p>

            </p>
            <p>Emma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment 
              were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and 
              had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, 
              he was expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on 
              business with Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so 
              openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room, 
              but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma. He had 
              been used to think her unjust to Jane, and had now great pleasure 
              in marking an improvement. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;A very pleasant evening,&quot; he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse 
              had been talked into what was necessary, told that he understood, 
              and the papers swept away;--&quot;particularly pleasant. You and 
              Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music. I do not know a more 
              luxurious state, sir, than sitting at one's ease to be entertained 
              a whole evening by two such young women; sometimes with music and 
              sometimes with conversation. I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found 
              the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothing undone. I was glad 
              you made her play so much, for having no instrument at her grandmother's, 
              it must have been a real indulgence.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am happy you approved,&quot; said Emma, smiling; &quot;but 
              I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, my dear,&quot; said her father instantly; &quot;that 
              I am sure you are not. There is nobody half so attentive and civil 
              as you are. If any thing, you are too attentive. The muffin last 
              night--if it had been handed round once, I think it would have been 
              enough.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; &quot;you 
              are not often deficient; not often deficient either in manner or 
              comprehension. I think you understand me, therefore.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>An arch look expressed--&quot;I understand you well enough;&quot; 
              but she said only, &quot;Miss Fairfax is reserved.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome 
              all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that 
              has its foundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must 
              be honoured.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You think her diffident. I do not see it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My dear Emma,&quot; said he, moving from his chair into one 
              close by her, &quot;you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you 
              had not a pleasant evening.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking 
              questions; and amused to think how little information I obtained.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am disappointed,&quot; was his only answer. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I hope every body had a pleasant evening,&quot; said Mr. 
              Woodhouse, in his quiet way. &quot;I had. Once, I felt the fire 
              rather too much; but then I moved back my chair a little, a very 
              little, and it did not disturb me. Miss Bates was very chatty and 
              good-humoured, as she always is, though she speaks rather too quick. 
              However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs. Bates too, in a different 
              way. I like old friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty 
              sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young 
              lady indeed. She must have found the evening agreeable, Mr. Knightley, 
              because she had Emma.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the 
              present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question-- 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's 
              eyes from. I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her 
              from my heart.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared 
              to express; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose 
              thoughts were on the Bates's, said-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so 
              confined! a great pity indeed! and I have often wished--but it is 
              so little one can venture to do--small, trifling presents, of any 
              thing uncommon-- Now we have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of 
              sending them a loin or a leg; it is very small and delicate--Hartfield 
              pork is not like any other pork--but still it is pork--and, my dear 
              Emma, unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks, nicely 
              fried, as ours are fried, without the smallest grease, and not roast 
              it, for no stomach can bear roast pork--I think we had better send 
              the leg-- do not you think so, my dear?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would 
              wish it. There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is 
              so very nice, and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner 
              they like.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That's right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it 
              before, but that is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; 
              and then, if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly 
              boiled, just as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, 
              with a boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider 
              it unwholesome.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Emma,&quot; said Mr. Knightley presently, &quot;I have a 
              piece of news for you. You like news--and I heard an article in 
              my way hither that I think will interest you.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?--why do you 
              smile so?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He had time only to say, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,&quot; 
              when the door was thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked 
              into the room. Full of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew 
              not which to give quickest. Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost 
              his moment, and that not another syllable of communication could 
              rest with him. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss Woodhouse-- 
              I come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! 
              You are too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going 
              to be married.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was so 
              completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and 
              a little blush, at the sound. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;There is my news:--I thought it would interest you,&quot; 
              said Mr. Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some 
              part of what had passed between them. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But where could you hear it?&quot; cried Miss Bates. &quot;Where 
              could you possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes 
              since I received Mrs. Cole's note--no, it cannot be more than five-- 
              or at least ten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready 
              to come out--I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about 
              the pork--Jane was standing in the passage--were not you, Jane?-- 
              for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan large 
              enough. So I said I would go down and see, and Jane said, `Shall 
              I go down instead? for I think you have a little cold, and Patty 
              has been washing the kitchen.'--`Oh! my dear,' said I--well, and 
              just then came the note. A Miss Hawkins-- that's all I know. A Miss 
              Hawkins of Bath. But, Mr. Knightley, how could you possibly have 
              heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of it, she 
              sat down and wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He 
              had just read Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to 
              me directly.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of 
              news more generally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too 
              bountiful. My mother desires her very best compliments and regards, 
              and a thousand thanks, and says you really quite oppress her.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;We consider our Hartfield pork,&quot; replied Mr. Woodhouse--&quot;indeed 
              it certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and 
              I cannot have a greater pleasure than---&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only 
              too good to us. If ever there were people who, without having great 
              wealth themselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure 
              it is us. We may well say that `our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.' 
              Well, Mr. Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well--&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It was short--merely to announce--but cheerful, exulting, 
              of course.&quot;-- Here was a sly glance at Emma. &quot;He had been 
              so fortunate as to-- I forget the precise words--one has no business 
              to remember them. The information was, as you state, that he was 
              going to be married to a Miss Hawkins. By his style, I should imagine 
              it just settled.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mr. Elton going to be married!&quot; said Emma, as soon as 
              she could speak. &quot;He will have every body's wishes for his 
              happiness.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He is very young to settle,&quot; was Mr. Woodhouse's observation. 
              &quot;He had better not be in a hurry. He seemed to me very well 
              off as he was. We were always glad to see him at Hartfield.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!&quot; said Miss 
              Bates, joyfully; &quot;my mother is so pleased!--she says she cannot 
              bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress. This is great 
              news, indeed. Jane, you have never seen Mr. Elton!--no wonder that 
              you have such a curiosity to see him.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Jane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly 
              to occupy her. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No--I have never seen Mr. Elton,&quot; she replied, starting 
              on this appeal; &quot;is he--is he a tall man?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Who shall answer that question?&quot; cried Emma. &quot;My 
              father would say `yes,' Mr. Knightley `no;' and Miss Bates and I 
              that he is just the happy medium. When you have been here a little 
              longer, Miss Fairfax, you will understand that Mr. Elton is the 
              standard of perfection in Highbury, both in person and mind.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. He is the very best 
              young man--But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday 
              he was precisely the height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins,--I dare 
              say, an excellent young woman. His extreme attention to my mother-- 
              wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the 
              better, for my mother is a little deaf, you know--it is not much, 
              but she does not hear quite quick. Jane says that Colonel Campbell 
              is a little deaf. He fancied bathing might be good for it--the warm 
              bath-- but she says it did him no lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell, 
              you know, is quite our angel. And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming 
              young man, quite worthy of him. It is such a happiness when good 
              people get together--and they always do. Now, here will be Mr. Elton 
              and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles, such very good people; 
              and the Perrys--I suppose there never was a happier or a better 
              couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry. I say, sir,&quot; turning to Mr. 
              Woodhouse, &quot;I think there are few places with such society 
              as Highbury. I always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My 
              dear sir, if there is one thing my mother loves better than another, 
              it is pork--a roast loin of pork--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been 
              acquainted with her,&quot; said Emma, &quot;nothing I suppose can 
              be known. One feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance. 
              He has been gone only four weeks.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings, 
              Emma said, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You are silent, Miss Fairfax--but I hope you mean to take 
              an interest in this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing 
              so much of late on these subjects, who must have been so deep in 
              the business on Miss Campbell's account--we shall not excuse your 
              being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;When I have seen Mr. Elton,&quot; replied Jane, &quot; I 
              dare say I shall be interested--but I believe it requires that with 
              me. And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married, the impression 
              may be a little worn off.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss 
              Woodhouse,&quot; said Miss Bates, &quot;four weeks yesterday.--A 
              Miss Hawkins!--Well, I had always rather fancied it would be some 
              young lady hereabouts; not that I ever--Mrs. Cole once whispered 
              to me--but I immediately said, `No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young 
              man--but'--In short, I do not think I am particularly quick at those 
              sort of discoveries. I do not pretend to it. What is before me, 
              I see. At the same time, nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should 
              have aspired--Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. 
              She knows I would not offend for the world. How does Miss Smith 
              do? She seems quite recovered now. Have you heard from Mrs. John 
              Knightley lately? Oh! those dear little children. Jane, do you know 
              I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley. I mean in person--tall, 
              and with that sort of look--and not very talkative.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body 
              beforehand. One takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. Dixon, 
              you say, is not, strictly speaking, handsome?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Handsome! Oh! no--far from it--certainly plain. I told you 
              he was plain.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him 
              to be plain, and that you yourself--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have 
              a regard, I always think a person well-looking. But I gave what 
              I believed the general opinion, when I called him plain.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away.The 
              weather does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are 
              too obliging, my dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. 
              This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just 
              go round by Mrs. Cole's; but I shall not stop three minutes: and, 
              Jane, you had better go home directly--I would not have you out 
              in a shower!--We think she is the better for Highbury already. Thank 
              you, we do indeed. I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, 
              for I really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork: 
              when we dress the leg it will be another thing. Good morning to 
              you, my dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is coming too. Well, that is 
              so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be so kind as to 
              give her your arm.--Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!--Good morning to 
              you.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him 
              while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to 
              marry-- and to marry strangers too--and the other half she could 
              give to her own view of the subject. It was to herself an amusing 
              and a very welcome piece of news, as proving that Mr. Elton could 
              not have suffered long; but she was sorry for Harriet: Harriet must 
              feel it--and all that she could hope was, by giving the first information 
              herself, to save her from hearing it abruptly from others. It was 
              now about the time that she was likely to call. If she were to meet 
              Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its beginning to rain, Emma was 
              obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs. 
              Goddard's, and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon 
              her without preparation. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five 
              minutes, when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look 
              which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and 
              the &quot;Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!&quot; 
              which instantly burst forth, had all the evidence of corresponding 
              perturbation. </p>
            <p>As the blow was given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater 
              kindness than in listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly 
              through what she had to tell. &quot;She had set out from Mrs. Goddard's 
              half an hour ago--she had been afraid it would rain--she had been 
              afraid it would pour down every moment--but she thought she might 
              get to Hartfield first--she had hurried on as fast as possible; 
              but then, as she was passing by the house where a young woman was 
              making up a gown for her, she thought she would just step in and 
              see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment 
              there, soon after she came out it began to rain, and she did not 
              know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as she could, and 
              took shelter at Ford's.&quot;--Ford's was the principal woollen-draper, 
              linen-draper, and haberdasher's shop united; the shop first in size 
              and fashion in the place.--&quot;And so, there she had set, without 
              an idea of any thing in the world, full ten minutes, perhaps--when, 
              all of a sudden, who should come in-- to be sure it was so very 
              odd!--but they always dealt at Ford's-- who should come in, but 
              Elizabeth Martin and her brother!-- Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. 
              I thought I should have fainted.I did not know what to do. I was 
              sitting near the door--Elizabeth saw me directly; but he did not; 
              he was busy with the umbrella. I am sure she saw me, but she looked 
              away directly, and took no notice; and they both went to quite the 
              farther end of the shop; and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh! 
              dear; I was so miserable! I am sure I must have been as white as 
              my gown. I could not go away you know, because of the rain; but 
              I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there.--Oh! dear, 
              Miss Woodhouse--well, at last, I fancy, he looked round and saw 
              me; for instead of going on with her buyings, they began whispering 
              to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; and I could not 
              help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me--(do you 
              think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward--came 
              quite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake 
              hands, if I would. She did not do any of it in the same way that 
              she used; I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed 
              to try to be very friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking 
              some time; but I know no more what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I 
              remember she said she was sorry we never met now; which I thought 
              almost too kind! Dear, Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! 
              By that time, it was beginning to hold up, and I was determined 
              that nothing should stop me from getting away--and then--only think!-- 
              I found he was coming up towards me too--slowly you know, and as 
              if he did not quite know what to do; and so he came and spoke, and 
              I answered--and I stood for a minute, feeling dreadfully, you know, 
              one can't tell how; and then I took courage, and said it did not 
              rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got three yards 
              from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I was going 
              to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole's 
              stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain. 
              Oh! dear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I said, 
              I was very much obliged to him: you know I could not do less; and 
              then he went back to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables--I 
              believe I did--but I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about 
              it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I would rather done any thing than have 
              it happen: and yet, you know, there was a sort of satisfaction in 
              seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly. And Elizabeth, too. 
              Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and make me comfortable again.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately 
              in her power. She was obliged to stop and think. She was not thoroughly 
              comfortable herself. The young man's conduct, and his sister's, 
              seemed the result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them. 
              As Harriet described it, there had been an interesting mixture of 
              wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour. But she 
              had believed them to be well-meaning, worthy people before; and 
              what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion? It 
              was folly to be disturbed by it. Of course, he must be sorry to 
              lose her--they must be all sorry. Ambition, as well as love, had 
              probably been mortified. They might all have hoped to rise by Harriet's 
              acquaintance: and besides, what was the value of Harriet's description?--So 
              easily pleased--so little discerning;-- what signified her praise? 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by considering 
              all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being 
              dwelt on, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It might be distressing, for the moment,&quot; said she; 
              &quot;but you seem to have behaved extremely well; and it is over--and 
              may never-- can never, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore 
              you need not think about it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet said, &quot;very true,&quot; and she &quot;would not think 
              about it;&quot; but still she talked of it--still she could talk 
              of nothing else; and Emma, at last, in order to put the Martins 
              out of her head, was obliged to hurry on the news, which she had 
              meant to give with so much tender caution; hardly knowing herself 
              whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such 
              a state of mind in poor Harriet--such a conclusion of Mr. Elton's 
              importance with her! <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived. Though she did 
              not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before, 
              or an hour before, its interest soon increased; and before their 
              first conversation was over, she had talked herself into all the 
              sensations of curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as 
              to this fortunate Miss Hawkins, which could conduce to place the 
              Martins under proper subordination in her fancy. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting. 
              It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining 
              any influence to alarm. As Harriet now lived, the Martins could 
              not get at her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted 
              either the courage or the condescension to seek her; for since her 
              refusal of the brother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard's; 
              and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together 
              again, with any necessity, or even any power of speech. </p>

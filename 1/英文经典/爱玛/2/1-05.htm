            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,&quot; 
              said Mr. Knightley, &quot;of this great intimacy between Emma and 
              Harriet Smith, but I think it a bad thing.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?-- why so?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I think they will neither of them do the other any good.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying 
              her with a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma 
              good. I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. 
              How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other 
              any good! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels 
              about Emma, Mr. Knightley.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, 
              knowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own 
              battle.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, 
              for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of 
              it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that 
              there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with. 
              Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this 
              case. You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the 
              value of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of 
              the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, 
              after being used to it all her life. I can imagine your objection 
              to Harriet Smith. She is not the superior young woman which Emma's 
              friend ought to be. But on the other hand, as Emma wants to see 
              her better informed, it will be an inducement to her to read more 
              herself. They will read together. She means it, I know.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve 
              years old. I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various 
              times of books that she meant to read regularly through--and very 
              good lists they were--very well chosen, and very neatly arranged--sometimes 
              alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew 
              up when only fourteen--I remember thinking it did her judgment so 
              much credit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may 
              have made out a very good list now. But I have done with expecting 
              any course of steady reading from Emma. She will never submit to 
              any thing requiring industry and patience, and a subjection of the 
              fancy to the understanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, 
              I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.-- You never 
              could persuade her to read half so much as you wished.--You know 
              you could not.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I dare say,&quot; replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, &quot;that 
              I thought so then;--but since we have parted, I can never remember 
              Emma's omitting to do any thing I wished.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as 
              that,&quot;--said Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or 
              two he had done. &quot;But I,&quot; he soon added, &quot;who have 
              had no such charm thrown over my senses, must still see, hear, and 
              remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family. 
              At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able to answer 
              questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was always 
              quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since she 
              was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. 
              In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She 
              inherits her mother's talents, and must have been under subjection 
              to her.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent 
              on your recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and 
              wanted another situation; I do not think you would have spoken a 
              good word for me to any body. I am sure you always thought me unfit 
              for the office I held.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said he, smiling. &quot;You are better placed 
              here; very fit for a wife, but not at all for a governess. But you 
              were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you 
              were at Hartfield. You might not give Emma such a complete education 
              as your powers would seem to promise; but you were receiving a very 
              good education from her, on the very material matrimonial point 
              of submitting your own will, and doing as you were bid; and if Weston 
              had asked me to recommend him a wife, I should certainly have named 
              Miss Taylor.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good 
              wife to such a man as Mr. Weston.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, 
              and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to 
              be borne. We will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from 
              the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I hope not that.--It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do 
              not foretell vexation from that quarter.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend 
              to Emma's genius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all 
              my heart, the young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill 
              in fortune.--But Harriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet 
              Smith. I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could 
              possibly have. She knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as 
              knowing every thing. She is a flatterer in all her ways; and so 
              much the worse, because undesigned. Her ignorance is hourly flattery. 
              How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet 
              is presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet, 
              I will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance. 
              Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places 
              she belongs to. She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable 
              with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home. 
              I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any strength of mind, 
              or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties 
              of her situation in life.--They only give a little polish.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, 
              or am more anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament 
              the acquaintance. How well she looked last night!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would 
              you? Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer 
              perfect beauty than Emma altogether-- face and figure?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I 
              have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. 
              But I am a partial old friend.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular 
              features, open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom 
              of full health, and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and 
              upright figure! There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in 
              her air, her head, her glance. One hears sometimes of a child being 
              `the picture of health;' now, Emma always gives me the idea of being 
              the complete picture of grown-up health. She is loveliness itself. 
              Mr. Knightley, is not she?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I have not a fault to find with her person,&quot; he replied. 
              &quot;I think her all you describe. I love to look at her; and I 
              will add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain. Considering 
              how very handsome she is, she appears to be little occupied with 
              it; her vanity lies another way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked 
              out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them 
              both harm.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of 
              its not doing them any harm. With all dear Emma's little faults, 
              she is an excellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, 
              or a kinder sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities 
              which may be trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; 
              she will make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in 
              the right a hundred times.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an 
              angel, and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings 
              John and Isabella. John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore 
              not a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks as he does; except 
              when he is not quite frightened enough about the children. I am 
              sure of having their opinions with me.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust 
              or unkind; but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I 
              consider myself, you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of 
              speech that Emma's mother might have had) the liberty of hinting 
              that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith's 
              intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you. Pray 
              excuse me; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended 
              from the intimacy, it cannot be expected that Emma, accountable 
              to nobody but her father, who perfectly approves the acquaintance, 
              should put an end to it, so long as it is a source of pleasure to 
              herself. It has been so many years my province to give advice, that 
              you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this little remains of 
              office.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Not at all,&quot; cried he; &quot;I am much obliged to you 
              for it. It is very good advice, and it shall have a better fate 
              than your advice has often found; for it shall be attended to.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made 
              unhappy about her sister.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Be satisfied,&quot; said he, &quot;I will not raise any outcry. 
              I will keep my ill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest 
              in Emma. Isabella does not seem more my sister; has never excited 
              a greater interest; perhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, 
              a curiosity in what one feels for Emma. I wonder what will become 
              of her!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;So do I,&quot; said Mrs. Weston gently, &quot;very much.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, 
              means just nothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever 
              seen a man she cared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to 
              be very much in love with a proper object. I should like to see 
              Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good. 
              But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom 
              from home.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break 
              her resolution at present,&quot; said Mrs. Weston, &quot;as can 
              well be; and while she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her 
              to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties 
              on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account. I do not recommend matrimony at 
              present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure 
              you.&quot; </p>
            <p>Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her 
              own and Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible. There 
              were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it was not 
              desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition which 
              Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to &quot;What does Weston think 
              of the weather; shall we have rain?&quot; convinced her that he 
              had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield. </p>

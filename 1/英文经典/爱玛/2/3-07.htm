            <p>They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward 
              circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were 
              in favour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating 
              safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in 
              good time. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, 
              with the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained 
              with Mr. Woodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they 
              got there. Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, 
              and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but 
              in the general amount of the day there was deficiency. There was 
              a languor, a want of spirits, a want of union, which could not be 
              got over. They separated too much into parties. The Eltons walked 
              together; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane; and 
              Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill. And Mr. Weston tried, 
              in vain, to make them harmonise better. It seemed at first an accidental 
              division, but it never materially varied. Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, 
              shewed no unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable as they could; 
              but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill, there 
              seemed a principle of separation, between the other parties, too 
              strong for any fine prospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful 
              Mr. Weston, to remove. <br>
            </p>
            <p>At first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen Frank 
              Churchill so silent and stupid. He said nothing worth hearing-- 
              looked without seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without 
              knowing what she said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that 
              Harriet should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal 
              better, for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his 
              first object. Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, 
              was paid to her. To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed 
              all that he cared for--and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry 
              to be flattered, was gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly 
              encouragement, the admission to be gallant, which she had ever given 
              in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance; but 
              which now, in her own estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment 
              of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as 
              no English word but flirtation could very well describe. &quot;Mr. 
              Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively.&quot; 
              They were laying themselves open to that very phrase--and to having 
              it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland by 
              another. Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity; 
              it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected. 
              She laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked him 
              for his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship, 
              admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning 
              back her heart. She still intended him for her friend. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;How much I am obliged to you,&quot; said he, &quot;for telling 
              me to come to-day!-- If it had not been for you, I should certainly 
              have lost all the happiness of this party. I had quite determined 
              to go away again.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except 
              that you were too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder 
              friend than you deserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to 
              be commanded to come.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame 
              me.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It is hotter to-day.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You are comfortable because you are under command.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Your command?--Yes.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. 
              You had, somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away 
              from your own management; but to-day you are got back again--and 
              as I cannot be always with you, it is best to believe your temper 
              under your own command rather than mine.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without 
              a motive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be 
              always with me. You are always with me.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Dating from three o'clock yesterday. My perpetual influence 
              could not begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out 
              of humour before.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Three o'clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had 
              seen you first in February.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her 
              voice)-- nobody speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much 
              to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I say nothing of which I am ashamed,&quot; replied he, with 
              lively impudence. &quot;I saw you first in February. Let every body 
              on the Hill hear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham 
              on one side, and Dorking on the other. I saw you first in February.&quot; 
              And then whispering-- &quot;Our companions are excessively stupid. 
              What shall we do to rouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They shall 
              talk. Ladies and gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, 
              wherever she is, presides) to say, that she desires to know what 
              you are all thinking of?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great 
              deal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding; 
              Mr. Knightley's answer was the most distinct. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we 
              are all thinking of?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! no, no&quot;--cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she 
              could-- &quot;Upon no account in the world. It is the very last 
              thing I would stand the brunt of just now. Let me hear any thing 
              rather than what you are all thinking of. I will not say quite all. 
              There are one or two, perhaps, (glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,) 
              whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It is a sort of thing,&quot; cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, 
              &quot;which I should not have thought myself privileged to inquire 
              into. Though, perhaps, as the Chaperon of the party-- I never was 
              in any circle--exploring parties--young ladies--married women--&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in 
              reply, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed--quite 
              unheard of-- but some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as 
              a joke. Every body knows what is due to you.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It will not do,&quot; whispered Frank to Emma; &quot;they 
              are most of them affronted. I will attack them with more address. 
              Ladies and gentlemen--I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that 
              she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking 
              of, and only requires something very entertaining from each of you, 
              in a general way. Here are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she 
              is pleased to say, am very entertaining already,) and she only demands 
              from each of you either one thing very clever, be it prose or verse, 
              original or repeated--or two things moderately clever-- or three 
              things very dull indeed, and she engages to laugh heartily at them 
              all.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! very well,&quot; exclaimed Miss Bates, &quot;then I need 
              not be uneasy. `Three things very dull indeed.' That will just do 
              for me, you know. I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon 
              as ever I open my mouth, shan't I? (looking round with the most 
              good-humoured dependence on every body's assent)--Do not you all 
              think I shall?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma could not resist. <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! ma'am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me--but 
              you will be limited as to number--only three at once.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not 
              immediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could 
              not anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah!--well--to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, (turning 
              to Mr. Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make 
              myself very disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing 
              to an old friend.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I like your plan,&quot; cried Mr. Weston. &quot;Agreed, agreed. 
              I will do my best. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum 
              reckon?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,&quot; answered his son;--&quot;but 
              we shall be indulgent--especially to any one who leads the way.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, no,&quot; said Emma, &quot;it will not reckon low. A 
              conundrum of Mr. Weston's shall clear him and his next neighbour. 
              Come, sir, pray let me hear it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I doubt its being very clever myself,&quot; said Mr. Weston.&quot;It 
              is too much a matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters 
              of the alphabet are there, that express perfection?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What two letters!--express perfection! I am sure I do not 
              know.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! you will never guess. You, (to Emma), I am certain, will 
              never guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Understanding and gratification came together. It might be a very 
              indifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at 
              and enjoy in it--and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem 
              to touch the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid 
              about it, and Mr. Knightley gravely said, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and 
              Mr. Weston has done very well for himself; but he must have knocked 
              up every body else. Perfection should not have come quite so soon.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,&quot; said Mrs. 
              Elton; &quot;I really cannot attempt--I am not at all fond of the 
              sort of thing. I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, 
              which I was not at all pleased with. I knew who it came from. An 
              abominable puppy!-- You know who I mean (nodding to her husband). 
              These kind of things are very well at Christmas, when one is sitting 
              round the fire; but quite out of place, in my opinion, when one 
              is exploring about the country in summer. Miss Woodhouse must excuse 
              me. I am not one of those who have witty things at every body's 
              service. I do not pretend to be a wit. I have a great deal of vivacity 
              in my own way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak 
              and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, if you please, Mr. Churchill. 
              Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself. We have nothing clever 
              to say-- not one of us. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, yes, pray pass me,&quot; added her husband, with a sort 
              of sneering consciousness; &quot;I have nothing to say that can 
              entertain Miss Woodhouse, or any other young lady. An old married 
              man-- quite good for nothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long 
              on one spot. Come, Jane, take my other arm.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off. 
              &quot;Happy couple!&quot; said Frank Churchill, as soon as they 
              were out of hearing:--&quot;How well they suit one another!--Very 
              lucky--marrying as they did, upon an acquaintance formed only in 
              a public place!--They only knew each other, I think, a few weeks 
              in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!-- for as to any real knowledge of a person's 
              disposition that Bath, or any public place, can give--it is all 
              nothing; there can be no knowledge. It is only by seeing women in 
              their own homes, among their own set, just as they always are, that 
              you can form any just judgment. Short of that, it is all guess and 
              luck-- and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man has committed 
              himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest of his 
              life!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her own 
              confederates, spoke now. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Such things do occur, undoubtedly.&quot;--She was stopped 
              by a cough. Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You were speaking,&quot; said he, gravely. She recovered 
              her voice. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate 
              circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot 
              imagine them to be very frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment 
              may arise-- but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards. 
              I would be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute 
              characters, (whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,) 
              who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience, 
              an oppression for ever.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and 
              soon afterwards said, in a lively tone, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that 
              whenever I marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will 
              you? (turning to Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure 
              I should like any body fixed on by you. You provide for the family, 
              you know, (with a smile at his father). Find some body for me. I 
              am in no hurry. Adopt her, educate her.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And make her like myself.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;By all means, if you can.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming 
              wife.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for 
              nothing else. I shall go abroad for a couple of years--and when 
              I return, I shall come to you for my wife. Remember.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touch 
              every favourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creature 
              described? Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all 
              that he wished. He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the 
              moment; who could say? Referring the education to her seemed to 
              imply it. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Now, ma'am,&quot; said Jane to her aunt, &quot;shall we join 
              Mrs. Elton?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. 
              I was ready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. 
              We shall soon overtake her. There she is--no, that's somebody else. 
              That's one of the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like 
              her.-- Well, I declare--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr. 
              Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young 
              man's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew 
              tired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather 
              walking quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost 
              alone, and quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful 
              views beneath her. The appearance of the servants looking out for 
              them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight; and even 
              the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart, and the solicitude 
              of Mrs. Elton to have her carriage first, were gladly endured, in 
              the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very 
              questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure. Such another scheme, 
              composed of so many ill-assorted people, she hoped never to be betrayed 
              into again. <br>
            </p>
            <p>While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her 
              side. He looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and 
              then said, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to 
              do: a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must 
              still use it. I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. 
              How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so 
              insolent in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?-- 
              Emma, I had not thought it possible.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have 
              helped it. It was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand 
              me.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has 
              talked of it since. I wish you could have heard how she talked of 
              it-- with what candour and generosity. I wish you could have heard 
              her honouring your forbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, 
              as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father, when 
              her society must be so irksome.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; cried Emma, &quot;I know there is not a better 
              creature in the world: but you must allow, that what is good and 
              what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;They are blended,&quot; said he, &quot;I acknowledge; and, 
              were she prosperous, I could allow much for the occasional prevalence 
              of the ridiculous over the good. Were she a woman of fortune, I 
              would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance, I would 
              not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner. Were she your 
              equal in situation-- but, Emma, consider how far this is from being 
              the case. She is poor; she has sunk from the comforts she was born 
              to; and, if she live to old age, must probably sink more. Her situation 
              should secure your compassion. It was badly done, indeed! You, whom 
              she had known from an infant, whom she had seen grow up from a period 
              when her notice was an honour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits, 
              and the pride of the moment, laugh at her, humble her--and before 
              her niece, too--and before others, many of whom (certainly some,) 
              would be entirely guided by your treatment of her.--This is not 
              pleasant to you, Emma--and it is very far from pleasant to me; but 
              I must, I will,--I will tell you truths while I can; satisfied with 
              proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and trusting 
              that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you 
              can do now.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it 
              was ready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her 
              in. He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted, 
              and her tongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against 
              herself, mortification, and deep concern. She had not been able 
              to speak; and, on entering the carriage, sunk back for a moment 
              overcome--then reproaching herself for having taken no leave, making 
              no acknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness, she looked out 
              with voice and hand eager to shew a difference; but it was just 
              too late. He had turned away, and the horses were in motion. She 
              continued to look back, but in vain; and soon, with what appeared 
              unusual speed, they were half way down the hill, and every thing 
              left far behind. She was vexed beyond what could have been expressed--almost 
              beyond what she could conceal. Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, 
              grieved, at any circumstance in her life. She was most forcibly 
              struck. The truth of this representation there was no denying. She 
              felt it at her heart. How could she have been so brutal, so cruel 
              to Miss Bates! How could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion 
              in any one she valued! And how suffer him to leave her without saying 
              one word of gratitude, of concurrence, of common kindness! <br>
            </p>
            <p>Time did not compose her. As she reflected more, she seemed but 
              to feel it more. She never had been so depressed. Happily it was 
              not necessary to speak. There was only Harriet, who seemed not in 
              spirits herself, fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma 
              felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home, 
              without being at any trouble to check them, extraordinary as they 
              were. </p>

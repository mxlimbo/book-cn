              VOLUME I<br>

            <p align="center">CHAPTER III<br>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very 
              much to have his friends come and see him; and from various united 
              causes, from his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, 
              from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command 
              the visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. 
              He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle; 
              his horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit 
              for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms. 
            </p>
            <p>Fortunately for him, Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish, 
              and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, 
              comprehended many such. Not unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion, 
              he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening 
              parties were what he preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at 
              any time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the 
              week in which Emma could not make up a card-table for him. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; 
              and by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the 
              privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude 
              for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room, 
              and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being 
              thrown away. <br>
            </p>
            <p>After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom 
              were Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost 
              always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were 
              fetched and carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it 
              no hardship for either James or the horses. Had it taken place only 
              once a year, it would have been a grievance. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very 
              old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived 
              with her single daughter in a very small way, and was considered 
              with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady, under 
              such untoward circumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a 
              most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, 
              rich, nor married. Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament 
              in the world for having much of the public favour; and she had no 
              intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself, or frighten 
              those who might hate her into outward respect. She had never boasted 
              either beauty or cleverness. Her youth had passed without distinction, 
              and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother, 
              and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible. 
              And yet she was a happy woman, and a woman whom no one named without 
              good-will. It was her own universal good-will and contented temper 
              which worked such wonders. She loved every body, was interested 
              in every body's happiness, quicksighted to every body's merits; 
              thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with blessings 
              in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours and friends, 
              and a home that wanted for nothing. The simplicity and cheerfulness 
              of her nature, her contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation 
              to every body, and a mine of felicity to herself. She was a great 
              talker upon little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, 
              full of trivial communications and harmless gossip. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary, or 
              an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences 
              of refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant 
              morality, upon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies 
              for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but 
              a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable 
              quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and 
              where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves 
              into a little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. 
              Mrs. Goddard's school was in high repute--and very deservedly; for 
              Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample 
              house and garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let 
              them run about a great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed 
              their chilblains with her own hands. It was no wonder that a train 
              of twenty young couple now walked after her to church. She was a 
              plain, motherly kind of woman, who had worked hard in her youth, 
              and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a 
              tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse's kindness, 
              felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour, hung 
              round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win or lose a few 
              sixpences by his fireside. <br>
            </p>
            <p>These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able 
              to collect; and happy was she, for her father's sake, in the power; 
              though, as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for 
              the absence of Mrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her father 
              look comfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving 
              things so well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made 
              her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long 
              evenings she had fearfully anticipated. <br>
            </p>
            <p>As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close 
              of the present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, 
              in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with 
              her; a most welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, 
              whom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest 
              in, on account of her beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, 
              and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had 
              placed her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school, and somebody 
              had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour-boarder. 
              This was all that was generally known of her history. She had no 
              visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and was 
              now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young 
              ladies who had been at chool there with her. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a 
              sort which Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and 
              fair, with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, 
              and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, 
              Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite 
              determined to continue the acquaintance. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's 
              conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not inconveniently 
              shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing, shewing 
              so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly grateful 
              for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by the 
              appearance of every thing in so perior a style to what she had been 
              used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Encouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those 
              natural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of 
              Highbury and its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed 
              were unworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, 
              though very good sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were 
              a family of the name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, 
              as renting a large farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish 
              of Donwell--very creditably, she believed--she knew Mr. Knightley 
              thought highly of them--but they must be coarse and unpolished, 
              and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little 
              more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect. She would notice 
              her; she would improve her; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, 
              and introduce her into good society; she would form her opinions 
              and her manners. It would be an interesting, and certainly a very 
              kind undertaking; highly becoming her own situation in life, her 
              leisure, and powers. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and 
              listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that 
              the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, 
              which always closed such parties, and for which she had been used 
              to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved 
              forwards to the fire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond 
              the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to 
              the credit of doing every thing well and attentively, with the real 
              good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do 
              all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken 
              and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable 
              to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare. 
              He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion 
              of his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome 
              made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his 
              hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his 
              care for their health made him grieve that they would eat. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that 
              he could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might 
              constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the 
              nicer things, to say: <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these 
              eggs. An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands 
              boiling an egg better than any body. I would not recommend an egg 
              boiledby any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very 
              small, you see--one of our small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, 
              let Emma help you to a little bit of tart--a very little bit. Ours 
              are all apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves 
              here. I do not advise the custard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to 
              half a glass of wine? A small half-glass, put into a tumbler of 
              water? I do not think it could disagree with you.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in a 
              much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular 
              pleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith 
              was quite equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a 
              personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had 
              given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little 
              girl went off with highly gratified feelings, delighted with the 
              affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening, 
              and actually shaken hands with her at last! </p>

              VOLUME III<br>

            <p align="center">CHAPTER III</p>
            <p align="center"> </p>
            <p>This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable 
              pleasure. It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, 
              which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She 
              was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding 
              respecting the Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and 
              wife were so much alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession 
              in her favour, was peculiarly gratifying. The impertinence of the 
              Eltons, which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest 
              of her evening, had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; 
              and she looked forward to another happy result--the cure of Harriet's 
              infatuation.-- From Harriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance 
              before they quitted the ballroom, she had strong hopes. It seemed 
              as if her eyes were suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see 
              that Mr. Elton was not the superior creature she had believed him. 
              The fever was over, and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse 
              being quickened again by injurious courtesy. She depended on the 
              evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of 
              pointed neglect that could be farther requisite.--Harriet rational, 
              Frank Churchill not too much in love, and Mr. Knightley not wanting 
              to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer must be before her! 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. He had told her 
              that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, 
              as he was to be at home by the middle of the day. She did not regret 
              it. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put 
              them all to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits 
              freshened up for the demands of the two little boys, as well as 
              of their grandpapa, when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two 
              persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together--Frank 
              Churchill, with Harriet leaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A 
              moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had 
              happened. Harriet looked white and frightened, and he was trying 
              to cheer her.-- The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty 
              yards asunder;-- they were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet 
              immediately sinking into a chair fainted away. <br>
            </p>
            <p>A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered, 
              and surprizes be explained. Such events are very interesting, but 
              the suspense of them cannot last long. A few minutes made Emma acquainted 
              with the whole. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs. 
              Goddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, 
              and taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public 
              enough for safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile beyond 
              Highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each 
              side, it became for a considerable stretch very retired; and when 
              the young ladies had advanced some way into it, they had suddenly 
              perceived at a small distance before them, on a broader patch of 
              greensward by the side, a party of gipsies. A child on the watch, 
              came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton, excessively frightened, 
              gave a great scream, and calling on Harriet to follow her, ran up 
              a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at the top, and made the best 
              of her way by a short cut back to Highbury. </p>
            <p>But poor Harriet could not follow. She had suffered very much from 
              cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank brought 
              on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless-- and in 
              this state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged to remain. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been 
              more courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack 
              could not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen 
              children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all lamorous, 
              and impertinent in look, though not absolutely in word.--More and 
              more frightened, she immediately promised them money, and taking 
              out her purse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want 
              more, or to use her ill.--She was then able to walk, though but 
              slowly, and was moving away--but her terror and her purse were too 
              tempting, and she was followed, or rather surrounded, by the whole 
              gang, demanding more. <br>
            </p>
            <p>In this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling and 
              conditioning, they loud and insolent. By a most fortunate chance 
              his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her 
              assistance at this critical moment. The pleasantness of the morning 
              had induced him to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him 
              by another road, a mile or two beyond Highbury-- and happening to 
              have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates, 
              and to have forgotten to restore them, he had been obliged to stop 
              at her door, and go in for a few minutes: he was therefore later 
              than he had intended; and being on foot, was unseen by the whole 
              party till almost close to them. The terror which the woman and 
              boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion. He 
              had left them completely frightened; and Harriet eagerly clinging 
              to him, and hardly able to speak, had just strength enough to reach 
              Hartfield, before her spirits were quite overcome. It was his idea 
              to bring her to Hartfield: he had thought of no other place. <br>
              <br>
              This was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and 
              of Harriet's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.-- 
              He dared not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays 
              left him not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance 
              of her safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a 
              set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he set off, 
              with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend 
              and herself. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Such an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young 
              woman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting 
              certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So Emma 
              thought, at least. Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even 
              a mathematician have seen what she did, have witnessed their appearance 
              together, and heard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances 
              had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other?--How 
              much more must an imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation 
              and foresight!--especially with such a groundwork of anticipation 
              as her mind had already made. <br>
            </p>
            <p>It was a very extraordinary thing! Nothing of the sort had ever 
              occurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory; 
              no rencontre, no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened to 
              the very person, and at the very hour, when the other very person 
              was chancing to pass by to rescue her!--It certainly was very extraordinary!--And 
              knowing, as she did, the favourable state of mind of each at this 
              period, it struck her the more. He was wishing to get the better 
              of his attachment to herself, she just recovering from her mania 
              for Mr. Elton. It seemed as if every thing united to promise the 
              most interesting consequences. It was not possible that the occurrence 
              should not be strongly recommending each to the other. <br>
            </p>
            <p>In the few minutes' conversation which she had yet had with him, 
              while Harriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her 
              terror, her naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his 
              arm, with a sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, 
              after Harriet's own account had been given, he had expressed his 
              indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest 
              terms. Every thing was to take its natural course, however, neither 
              impelled nor assisted. She would not stir a step, nor drop a hint. 
              No, she had had enough of interference. There could be no harm in 
              a scheme, a mere passive scheme. It was no more than a wish. Beyond 
              it she would on no account proceed. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma's first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge 
              of what had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: 
              but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible. Within half 
              an hour it was known all over Highbury. It was the very event to 
              engage those who talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth 
              and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful 
              news. The last night's ball seemed lost in the gipsies. Poor Mr. 
              Woodhouse trembled as he sat, and, as Emma had foreseen, would scarcely 
              be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery 
              again. It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself 
              and Miss Woodhouse (for his neighbours knew that he loved to be 
              inquired after), as well as Miss Smith, were coming in during the 
              rest of the day; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer, 
              that they were all very indifferent-- which, though not exactly 
              true, for she was perfectly well, and Harriet not much otherwise, 
              Emma would not interfere with. She had an unhappy state of health 
              in general for the child of such a man, for she hardly knew what 
              indisposition was; and if he did not invent illnesses for her, she 
              could make no figure in a message. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took 
              themselves off in a hurry. The young ladies of Highbury might have 
              walked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole history 
              dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and 
              her nephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground, and Henry 
              and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and 
              the gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied 
              in the slightest particular from the original recital. </p>

            <p>When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma 
              found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;-- 
              with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton 
              engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself. She and Mrs. Weston were 
              obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together. 
              Mrs. Elton left them no choice. If Jane repressed her for a little 
              time, she soon began again; and though much that passed between 
              them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side, there 
              was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects: The post-office--catching 
              cold--fetching letters--and friendship, were long under discussion; 
              and to them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant 
              to Jane--inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely 
              to suit her, and professions of Mrs. Elton's meditated activity. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Here is April come!&quot; said she, &quot;I get quite anxious 
              about you. June will soon be here.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But I have never fixed on June or any other month--merely 
              looked forward to the summer in general.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But have you really heard of nothing?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any 
              yet.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware 
              of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I not aware!&quot; said Jane, shaking her head; &quot;dear 
              Mrs. Elton, who can have thought of it as I have done?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You 
              do not know how many candidates there always are for the first situations. 
              I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. 
              A cousin of Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; 
              every body was anxious to be in her family, for she moves in the 
              first circle. Wax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine how 
              desirable! Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge's is the one 
              I would most wish to see you in.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,&quot; 
              said Jane. &quot;I must spend some time with them; I am sure they 
              will want it;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. 
              But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries 
              at present.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving 
              me trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly 
              be more interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge 
              in a day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be on the 
              look-out for any thing eligible.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject 
              to her; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any 
              body trouble.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, 
              and June, or say even July, is very near, with such business to 
              accomplish before us. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation 
              such as you deserve, and your friends would require for you, is 
              no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment's notice; indeed, 
              indeed, we must begin inquiring directly.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I 
              make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by 
              my friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not 
              at all afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town, 
              offices, where inquiry would soon produce something--Offices for 
              the sale-- not quite of human flesh--but of human intellect.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean 
              a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always 
              rather a friend to the abolition.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,&quot; 
              replied Jane; &quot;governess-trade, I assure you, was all that 
              I had in view; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those 
              who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I 
              do not know where it lies. But I only mean to say that there are 
              advertising offices, and that by applying to them I should have 
              no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Something that would do!&quot; repeated Mrs. Elton. &quot;Aye, 
              that may suit your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest 
              creature you are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you 
              taking up with any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace 
              situation, in a family not moving in a certain circle, or able to 
              command the elegancies of life.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent; 
              it would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, 
              I think, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison. 
            </p>
            <p>A gentleman's family is all that I should condition for.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; 
              but I shall be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells 
              will be quite on my side; with your superior talents, you have a 
              right to move in the first circle. Your musical knowledge alone 
              would entitle you to name your own terms, have as many rooms as 
              you like, and mix in the family as much as you chose;--that is--I 
              do not know-- if you knew the harp, you might do all that, I am 
              very sure; but you sing as well as play;--yes, I really believe 
              you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what you chose;--and 
              you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and comfortably settled 
              before the Campbells or I have any rest.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort 
              of such a situation together,&quot; said Jane, &quot;they are pretty 
              sure to be equal; however, I am very serious in not wishing any 
              thing to be attempted at present for me. I am exceedingly obliged 
              to you, Mrs. Elton, I am obliged to any body who feels for me, but 
              I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer. 
              For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am, and as 
              I am.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And I am quite serious too, I assure you,&quot; replied Mrs. 
              Elton gaily,&quot;in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing 
              my friends to watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may 
              pass us.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing 
              till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change 
              of object, and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to 
              Jane, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!--Only think 
              of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear 
              creature he is;--I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all 
              that quaint, old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste 
              than modern ease; modern ease often disgusts me. But this good old 
              Mr. Woodhouse, I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at 
              dinner. Oh! I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be 
              absolutely jealous. I fancy I am rather a favourite; he took notice 
              of my gown. How do you like it?--Selina's choice--handsome, I think, 
              but I do not know whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest 
              dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed--quite a horror of finery. 
              I must put on a few ornaments now, because it is expected of me. 
              A bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but my natural taste 
              is all for simplicity; a simple style of dress is so infinitely 
              preferable to finery. But I am quite in the minority, I believe; 
              few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show and finery are 
              every thing. I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this 
              to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it will look well?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when 
              Mr. Weston made his appearance among them. He had returned to a 
              late dinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He 
              had been too much expected by the best judges, for surprize-- but 
              there was great joy. Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him 
              now, as he would have been sorry to see him before. John Knightley 
              only was in mute astonishment.--That a man who might have spent 
              his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London, should 
              set off again, and walk half a mile to another man's house, for 
              the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time, of finishing his 
              day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers, was a circumstance 
              to strike him deeply. A man who had been in motion since eight o'clock 
              in the morning, and might now have been still, who had been long 
              talking, and might have been silent, who had been in more than one 
              crowd, and might have been alone!--Such a man, to quit the tranquillity 
              and independence of his own fireside, and on the evening of a cold 
              sleety April day rush out again into the world!--Could he by a touch 
              of his finger have instantly taken back his wife, there would have 
              been a motive; but his coming would probably prolong rather than 
              break up the party. John Knightley looked at him with amazement, 
              then shrugged his shoulders, and said, &quot;I could not have believed 
              it even of him.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation 
              he was exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right 
              of being principal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home 
              confers, was making himself agreeable among the rest; and having 
              satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner, convincing 
              her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had 
              been forgotten, and spread abroad what public news he had heard, 
              was proceeding to a family communication, which, though principally 
              addressed to Mrs. Weston, he had not the smallest doubt of being 
              highly interesting to every body in the room. He gave her a letter, 
              it was from Frank, and to herself; he had met with it in his way, 
              and had taken the liberty of opening it. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Read it, read it,&quot; said he, &quot;it will give you pleasure; 
              only a few lines--will not take you long; read it to Emma.&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking 
              to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible 
              to every body. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what 
              do you say to it?--I always told you he would be here again soon, 
              did not I?--Anne, my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you 
              would not believe me?--In town next week, you see--at the latest, 
              I dare say; for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when 
              any thing is to be done; most likely they will be there to-morrow 
              or Saturday. As to her illness, all nothing of course. But it is 
              an excellent thing to have Frank among us again, so near as town. 
              They will stay a good while when they do come, and he will be half 
              his time with us. This is precisely what I wanted. Well, pretty 
              good news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read it all? 
              Put it up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it some other 
              time, but it will not do now. I shall only just mention the circumstance 
              to the others in a common way.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her looks 
              and words had nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she knew 
              she was happy, and knew she ought to be happy. Her congratulations 
              were warm and open; but Emma could not speak so fluently. She was 
              a little occupied in weighing her own feelings, and trying to understand 
              the degree of her agitation, which she rather thought was considerable. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative 
              to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did 
              say, and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by 
              a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard 
              already. <br>
            </p>
            <p>It was well that he took every body's joy for granted, or he might 
              not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly 
              delighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, 
              to be made happy;--from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, 
              but she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it 
              would have been too positive an interruption; and finding himself 
              close to Mrs. Elton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily 
              began on the subject with her. </p>

            <p>The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts 
              all the evening. How it might be considered by the rest of the party, 
              she could not tell. They, in their different homes, and their different 
              ways, might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view 
              it was a morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of 
              rational satisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, 
              than any she had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with 
              her father, was felicity to it. There, indeed, lay real pleasure, 
              for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four 
              to his comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree 
              of his fond affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her 
              general conduct, be open to any severe reproach. As a daughter, 
              she hoped she was not without a heart. She hoped no one could have 
              said to her, &quot;How could you be so unfeeling to your father?-- 
              I must, I will tell you truths while I can.&quot; Miss Bates should 
              never again--no, never! If attention, in future, could do away the 
              past, she might hope to be forgiven. She had been often remiss, 
              her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought than 
              fact; scornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more. In the 
              warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the very next 
              morning, and it should be the beginning, on her side, of a regular, 
              equal, kindly intercourse. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, 
              that nothing might prevent her. It was not unlikely, she thought, 
              that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might 
              come in while she were paying her visit. She had no objection. She 
              would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly 
              and truly hers. Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but 
              she saw him not. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;The ladies were all at home.&quot; She had never rejoiced 
              at the sound before, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked 
              up the stairs, with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring 
              obligation, or of deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule. <br>
            </p>
            <p>There was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking. 
              She heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in a hurry; 
              the maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased 
              to wait a moment, and then ushered her in too soon. The aunt and 
              niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room. Jane she had 
              a distinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door 
              had shut them out, she heard Miss Bates saying, &quot;Well, my dear, 
              I shall say you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you are 
              ill enough.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she 
              did not quite understand what was going on. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am afraid Jane is not very well,&quot; said she, &quot;but 
              I do not know; they tell me she is well. I dare say my daughter 
              will be here presently, Miss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair. 
              I wish Hetty had not gone. I am very little able--Have you a chair, 
              ma'am? Do you sit where you like? I am sure she will be here presently.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma seriously hoped she would. She had a moment's fear of Miss 
              Bates keeping away from her. But Miss Bates soon came--&quot;Very 
              happy and obliged&quot;--but Emma's conscience told her that there 
              was not the same cheerful volubility as before--less ease of look 
              and manner. A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, 
              might lead the way to a return of old feelings. The touch seemed 
              immediate. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!--I suppose you have 
              heard-- and are come to give us joy. This does not seem much like 
              joy, indeed, in me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will 
              be very trying for us to part with her, after having had her so 
              long, and she has a dreadful headach just now, writing all the morning:-- 
              such long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell, 
              and Mrs. Dixon. `My dear,' said I, `you will blind yourself'-- for 
              tears were in her eyes perpetually. One cannot wonder, one cannot 
              wonder. It is a great change; and though she is amazingly fortunate--such 
              a situation, I suppose, as no young woman before ever met with on 
              first going out--do not think us ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for 
              such surprising good fortune--(again dispersing her tears)--but, 
              poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache she has. When 
              one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel any blessing quite 
              as it may deserve. She is as low as possible. To look at her, nobody 
              would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such 
              a situation. You will excuse her not coming to you--she is not able--she 
              is gone into her own room-- I want her to lie down upon the bed. 
              `My dear,' said I, `I shall say you are laid down upon the bed:' 
              but, however, she is not; she is walking about the room. But, now 
              that she has written her letters, she says she shall soon be well. 
              She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, 
              but your kindness will excuse her. You were kept waiting at the 
              door--I was quite ashamed-- but somehow there was a little bustle--for 
              it so happened that we had not heard the knock, and till you were 
              on the stairs, we did not know any body was coming. `It is only 
              Mrs. Cole,' said I, `depend upon it. Nobody else would come so early.' 
              `Well,' said she, `it must be borne some time or other, and it may 
              as well be now.' But then Patty came in, and said it was you. `Oh!' 
              said I, `it is Miss Woodhouse: I am sure you will like to see her.'-- 
              `I can see nobody,' said she; and up she got, and would go away; 
              and that was what made us keep you waiting--and extremely sorry 
              and ashamed we were. `If you must go, my dear,' said I, `you must, 
              and I will say you are laid down upon the bed.'&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma was most sincerely interested. Her heart had been long growing 
              kinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings 
              acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her 
              nothing but pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less 
              gentle sensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might 
              very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, 
              when she might not bear to see herself. She spoke as she felt, with 
              earnest regret and solicitude--sincerely wishing that the circumstances 
              which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined 
              on, might be as much for Miss Fairfax's advantage and comfort as 
              possible. &quot;It must be a severe trial to them all. She had understood 
              it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell's return.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;So very kind! &quot; replied Miss Bates. &quot;But you are 
              always kind.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>There was no bearing such an &quot;always;&quot; and to break through 
              her dreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Where--may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;To a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have 
              the charge of her three little girls--delightful children. Impossible 
              that any situation could be more replete with comfort; if we except, 
              perhaps, Mrs. Suckling's own family, and Mrs. Bragge's; but Mrs. 
              Smallridge is intimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:--lives 
              only four miles from Maple Grove. Jane will be only four miles from 
              Maple Grove.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax 
              owes--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. 
              She would not take a denial. She would not let Jane say, `No;' for 
              when Jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday,the 
              very morning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she 
              was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the reasons 
              you mention; exactly as you say, she had made up her mind to close 
              with nothing till Colonel Campbell's return, and nothing should 
              induce her to enter into any engagement at present--and so she told 
              Mrs. Elton over and over again--and I am sure I had no more idea 
              that she would change her mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton, whose 
              judgment never fails her, saw farther than I did. It is not every 
              body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did, and 
              refuse to take Jane's answer; but she positively declared she would 
              not write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her; she would 
              wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all settled that 
              Jane should go. Quite a surprize to me! I had not the least idea!--Jane 
              took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, that upon thinking 
              over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation, she had come 
              to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word of it 
              till it was all settled.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled 
              so, upon the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. 
              `You must all spend your evening with us,' said she--`I positively 
              must have you all come.'&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and 
              though I thought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she 
              would not let him off, he did not;--but my mother, and Jane, and 
              I, were all there, and a very agreeable evening we had. Such kind 
              friends, you know,Miss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, 
              though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning's party. 
              Even pleasure, you know, is fatiguing--and I cannot say that any 
              of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it. However, I shall always 
              think it a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the 
              kind friends who included me in it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, 
              had been making up her mind the whole day?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I dare say she had.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and 
              all her friends--but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation 
              that is possible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the 
              family.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every 
              thing in the world that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings 
              and Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so 
              liberal and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, 
              a most delightful woman!--A style of living almost equal to Maple 
              Grove--and as to the children, except the little Sucklings and little 
              Bragges, there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere. Jane 
              will be treated with such regard and kindness!-- It will be nothing 
              but pleasure, a life of pleasure.--And her salary!-- I really cannot 
              venture to name her salary to you, Miss Woodhouse. Even you, used 
              as you are to great sums, would hardly believe that so much could 
              be given to a young person like Jane.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! madam,&quot; cried Emma, &quot;if other children are 
              at all like what I remember to have been myself, I should think 
              five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary 
              on such occasions, dearly earned.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You are so noble in your ideas!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very soon, very soon, indeed; that's the worst of it. Within 
              a fortnight. Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother 
              does not know how to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her 
              thoughts, and say, Come ma'am, do not let us think about it any 
              more.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel 
              and Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself 
              before their return?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such 
              a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining. I 
              was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying 
              to Mrs. Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating 
              me upon it! It was before tea--stay--no, it could not be before 
              tea, because we were just going to cards--and yet it was before 
              tea, because I remember thinking--Oh! no, now I recollect, now I 
              have it; something happened before tea, but not that. Mr. Elton 
              was called out of the room before tea, old John Abdy's son wanted 
              to speak with him. Poor old John, I have a great regard for him; 
              he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven years; and now, poor 
              old man, he is bed-ridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout 
              in his joints-- I must go and see him to-day; and so will Jane, 
              I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poor John's son came to talk 
              to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he is very well to do 
              himself, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every 
              thing of that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without 
              some help; and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John 
              ostler had been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise 
              having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond. 
              That was what happened before tea. It was after tea that Jane spoke 
              to Mrs. Elton.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new 
              this circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible 
              that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank 
              Churchill's going, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no 
              consequence. <br>
            </p>
            <p>What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being 
              the accumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge 
              of the servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over 
              from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill-- 
              which messenger, however, had been no more than was expected; and 
              that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines, containing, 
              upon the whole, a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill, and only 
              wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early; 
              but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly, 
              without waiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold, 
              Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise, and the 
              ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy going a good pace, 
              and driving very steady. <br>
            </p>
            <p>There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and 
              it caught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject which 
              already engaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's 
              importance in the world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was 
              every thing, the other nothing--and she sat musing on the difference 
              of woman's destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were 
              fixed, till roused by Miss Bates's saying, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What 
              is to become of that?--Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of 
              it just now.-- `You must go,' said she. `You and I must part. You 
              will have no business here.--Let it stay, however,' said she; `give 
              it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back. I shall talk about 
              it to him; he will settle for me; he will help me out of all my 
              difficulties.'-- And to this day, I do believe, she knows not whether 
              it was his present or his daughter's.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance 
              of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little 
              pleasing, that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had 
              been long enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she 
              could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt, took 
              leave. </p>

            </p>
            <p>Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. 
              Quick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, 
              and telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, 
              so did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking companion,Emma 
              had very early foreseen how useful she might find her. In that respect 
              Mrs. Weston's loss had been important. Her father never went beyond 
              the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for 
              his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. 
              Weston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined. She had 
              ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a 
              Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time 
              to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges. But in 
              every respect, as she saw more of her, she approved her, and was 
              confirmed in all her kind designs. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, 
              grateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring 
              to be guided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to 
              herself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company,and 
              power of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there 
              was no want of taste, though strength of understanding must not 
              be expected. Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's 
              being exactly the young friend she wanted--exactly the something 
              which her home required. Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of 
              the question. Two such could never be granted. Two such she did 
              not want. It was quite a different sort of thing, a sentiment distinct 
              and independent. Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had 
              its basis in gratitude and esteem. Harriet would be loved as one 
              to whom she could be useful. For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to 
              be done; for Harriet every thing. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out 
              who were the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready 
              to tell every thing in her power, but on this subject questions 
              were vain. Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could 
              never believe that in the same situation she should not have discovered 
              the truth. Harriet had no penetration. She had been satisfied to 
              hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked 
              no farther. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of 
              the school in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation--and 
              but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm, it 
              must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied her thoughts 
              a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them, and 
              now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe the 
              many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her talkativeness-- 
              amused by such a picture of another set of beings, and enjoying 
              the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation 
              of Mrs. Martin's having &quot;two parlours, two very good parlours, 
              indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's drawing-room; 
              and of her having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years 
              with her; and of their having eight cows, two of them lderneys, 
              and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow indeed; 
              and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it, it should 
              be called her cow; and of their having a very handsome summer-house 
              in their garden, where some day next year they were all to drink 
              tea:-- a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen 
              people.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate 
              cause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings 
              arose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and 
              daughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when 
              it appeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, 
              and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature 
              in doing something or other, was a single man; that there was no 
              young Mrs. Martin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to 
              her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and 
              that, if she were not taken care of, she might be required to sink 
              herself forever. <br>
            </p>
            <p>With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number 
              and meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. 
              Martin, and there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very 
              ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks 
              and merry evening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so 
              very good-humoured and obliging. He had gone three miles round one 
              day in order to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how 
              fond she was of them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging. 
              He had his shepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose 
              to sing to her. She was very fond of singing. He could sing a little 
              himself. She believed he was very clever, and understood every thing. 
              He had a very fine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been 
              bid more for his wool than any body in the country. She believed 
              every body spoke well of him. His mother and sisters were very fond 
              of him. Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and there was a blush 
              as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body to be a better 
              son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married, he would make 
              a good husband. Not that she wanted him to marry. She was in no 
              hurry at all. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well done, Mrs. Martin!&quot; thought Emma. &quot;You know 
              what you are about.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind 
              as to send Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. 
              Goddard had ever seen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, 
              and asked all the three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and 
              Miss Richardson, to sup with her.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond 
              the line of his own business? He does not read?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has 
              read a good deal--but not what you would think any thing of. He 
              reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in 
              one of the window seats--but he reads all them to himself. But sometimes 
              of an evening, before we went to cards, he would read something 
              aloud out of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know 
              he has read the Vicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of 
              the Forest, nor The Children of the Abbey. He had never heard of 
              such books before I mentioned them, but he is determined to get 
              them now as soon as ever he can.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>The next question was-- </p>
            <p>&quot;What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome. I thought him very 
              plain at first, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, 
              you know, after a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury 
              every now and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in 
              his way to Kingston. He has passed you very often.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without 
              having any idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback 
              or on foot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. 
              The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel 
              I can have nothing to do. A degree or two lower, and a creditable 
              appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their 
              families in some way or other. But a farmer can need none of my 
              help, and is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as 
              in every other he is below it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have 
              observed him; but he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. 
              I know, indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What 
              do you imagine his age to be?&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday 
              is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference--which is very 
              odd.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother 
              is perfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable 
              as they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she 
              would probably repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with 
              a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little 
              money, it might be very desirable.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty 
              years old!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, 
              who are not born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has 
              his fortune entirely to make--cannot be at all eforehand with the 
              world. Whatever money he might come into when his father died, whatever 
              his share of the family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, 
              all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though, with diligence 
              and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to impossible 
              that he should have realised any thing yet.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They 
              have no indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. 
              Martin talks of taking a boy another year.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he 
              does marry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though 
              his sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether 
              objected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at 
              all fit for you to notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to 
              make you particularly careful as to your associates. There can be 
              no doubt of your being a gentleman's daughter, and you must support 
              your claim to that station by every thing within your own power, 
              or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading 
              you.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at 
              Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid 
              of what any body can do.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; 
              but I would have you so firmly established in good society, as to 
              be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see 
              you permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable 
              to have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say 
              that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, 
              I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, 
              to be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer's 
              daughter, without education.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry 
              any body but what had had some education--and been very well brought 
              up. However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against your's--and 
              I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall 
              always have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, 
              and should be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as 
              well educated as me. But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, 
              certainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw 
              no alarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer, 
              but she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be 
              no serious difficulty, on Harriet's side, to oppose any friendly 
              arrangement of her own. <br>
            </p>
            <p>They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on 
              the Donwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully 
              at her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. 
              Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking 
              a few yards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick 
              eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance 
              was very neat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his 
              person had no other advantage; and when he came to be contrasted 
              with gentlemen, she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained 
              in Harriet's inclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; 
              she had voluntarily noticed her father's gentleness with admiration 
              as well as wonder. Mr. Martin looked as if he did not know what 
              manner was. </p>
            <p>They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must 
              not be kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a 
              smiling face, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse 
              hoped very soon to compose. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd! It 
              was quite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. 
              He did not think we ever walked this road. He thought we walked 
              towards Randalls most days. He has not been able to get the Romance 
              of the Forest yet. He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston 
              that he quite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd 
              we should happen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what 
              you expected? What do you think of him? Do you think him so very 
              plain?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that 
              is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility. I had no 
              right to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea 
              that he could be so very clownish, so totally without air. I had 
              imagined him, I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;To be sure,&quot; said Harriet, in a mortified voice, &quot;he 
              is not so genteel as real gentlemen.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have 
              been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, 
              that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. 
              At Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, 
              well bred men. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you 
              could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him 
              to be a very inferior creature--and rather wondering at yourself 
              for having ever thought him at all agreeable before. Do not you 
              begin to feel that now? Were not you struck? I am sure you must 
              have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner, and the 
              uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as 
              I stood here.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such 
              a fine air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference 
              plain enough. But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not 
              fair to compare Mr. Martin with him. You might not see one in a 
              hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But 
              he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to. What 
              say you to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either 
              of them.Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; 
              of speaking; of being silent. You must see the difference.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh yes!--there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost 
              an old man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older 
              a person grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners 
              should not be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, 
              or coarseness, or awkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth 
              is detestable in later age. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; 
              what will he be at Mr. Weston's time of life?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;There is no saying, indeed,&quot; replied Harriet rather 
              solemnly. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely 
              gross, vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking 
              of nothing but profit and loss.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;How much his business engrosses him already is very plain 
              from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book 
              you recommended. He was a great deal too full of the market to think 
              of any thing else--which is just as it should be, for a thriving 
              man. What has he to do with books? And I have no doubt that he will 
              thrive, and be a very rich man in time--and his being illiterate 
              and coarse need not disturb us.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I wonder he did not remember the book&quot;--was all Harriet's 
              answer, and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma 
              thought might be safely left to itself. She, therefore, said no 
              more for some time. Her next beginning was, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior 
              to Mr. Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness. They 
              might be more safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, 
              a quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body 
              likes in him, because there is so much good-humour with it--but 
              that would not do to be copied. Neither would Mr. nightley's downright, 
              decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits him very well; 
              his figure, and look, and situation in life seem to allow it; but 
              if any young man were to set about copying him, he would not be 
              sufferable. On the contrary, I think a young man might be very safely 
              recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, 
              cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He seems to me to be grown particularly 
              gentle of late. I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating 
              himself with either of us, Harriet, by additional softness, but 
              it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be. 
              If he means any thing, it must be to please you. Did not I tell 
              you what he said of you the other day?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn 
              from Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed 
              and smiled, and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the 
              young farmer out of Harriet's head. She thought it would be an excellent 
              match; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for 
              her to have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every 
              body else must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, 
              that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan, 
              as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet's 
              coming to Hartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was 
              her sense of its expediency. Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, 
              quite the gentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the 
              same time, not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful 
              birth of Harriet. He had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined 
              a very sufficient income; for though the vicarage of Highbury was 
              not large, he was known to have some independent property; and she 
              thought very highly of him as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable 
              young man, without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge 
              of the world. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful 
              girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, 
              was foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's there could 
              be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have 
              all the usual weight and efficacy. And he was really a very pleasing 
              young man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like. 
              He was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in general, 
              though not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature which 
              she could not dispense with:--but the girl who could be gratified 
              by a Robert Martin's riding about the country to get walnuts for 
              her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton's admiration. </p>

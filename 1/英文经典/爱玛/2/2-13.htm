            <p>Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her 
              ideas only varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was 
              a good deal; and afterwards, but little. She had great pleasure 
              in hearing Frank Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater 
              pleasure than ever in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often 
              thinking of him, and quite impatient for a letter, that she might 
              know how he was, how were his spirits, how was his aunt, and what 
              was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring. But, 
              on the other hand, she could not admit herself to be unhappy, nor, 
              after the first morning, to be less disposed for employment than 
              usual;she was still busy and cheerful; and, pleasing as he was, 
              she could yet imagine him to have faults; and farther, though thinking 
              of him so much, and, as she sat drawing or working, forming a thousand 
              amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment, 
              fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing elegant letters; the 
              conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she 
              refused him. Their affection was always to subside into friendship. 
              Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting; but still 
              they were to part. When she became sensible of this, it struck her 
              that she could not be very much in love; for in spite of her previous 
              and fixed determination never to quit her father, never to marry, 
              a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than 
              she could foresee in her own feelings. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice,&quot; 
              said she.-- &quot;In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate 
              negatives, is there any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do suspect 
              that he is not really necessary to my happiness. So much the better. 
              I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am 
              quite enough in love. I should be sorry to be more.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his 
              feelings. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He is undoubtedly very much in love--every thing denotes 
              it--very much in love indeed!--and when he comes again, if his affection 
              continue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be 
              most inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. 
              Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto. 
              No, if he had believed me at all to share his feelings, he would 
              not have been so wretched. Could he have thought himself encouraged, 
              his looks and language at parting would have been different.-- Still, 
              however, I must be on my guard. This is in the supposition of his 
              attachment continuing what it now is; but I do not know that I expect 
              it will; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man-- I 
              do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.-- His 
              feelings are warm, but I can imagine them rather changeable.-- Every 
              consideration of the subject, in short, makes me thankful that my 
              happiness is not more deeply involved.--I shall do very well again 
              after a little while--and then, it will be a good thing over; for 
              they say every body is in love once in their lives, and I shall 
              have been let off easily.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of 
              it; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which 
              made her at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think 
              she had undervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written 
              letter, giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings, 
              expressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was natural 
              and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local that 
              could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious 
              flourishes now of apology or concern; it was the language of real 
              feeling towards Mrs. Weston; and the transition from Highbury to 
              Enscombe, the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings 
              of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it 
              was felt, and how much more might have been said but for the restraints 
              of propriety.--The charm of her own name was not wanting. Miss Woodhouse 
              appeared more than once, and never without a something of pleasing 
              connexion, either a compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of 
              what she had said; and in the very last time of its meeting her 
              eye, unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry, 
              she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge 
              the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed. Compressed into 
              the very lowest vacant corner were these words--&quot;I had not 
              a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss Woodhouse's beautiful 
              little friend. Pray make my excuses and adieus to her.&quot; This, 
              Emma could not doubt, was all for herself. Harriet was remembered 
              only from being her friend. His information and prospects as to 
              Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated; 
              Mrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his 
              own imagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material 
              part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned 
              to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she 
              could still do without the writer, and that he must learn to do 
              without her. Her intentions were unchanged. Her resolution of refusal 
              only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent 
              consolation and happiness. His recollection of Harriet, and the 
              words which clothed it, the &quot;beautiful little friend,&quot; 
              suggested to her the idea of Harriet's succeeding her in his affections. 
              Was it impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior 
              in understanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness 
              of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the probabilities 
              of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.--For Harriet, 
              it would be advantageous and delightful indeed. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I must not dwell upon it,&quot; said she.--&quot;I must not 
              think of it. I know the danger of indulging such speculations. But 
              stranger things have happened; and when we cease to care for each 
              other as we do now, it will be the means of confirming us in that 
              sort of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward 
              to with pleasure.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf, though 
              it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that 
              quarter was at hand. As Frank Churchill's arrival had succeeded 
              Mr. Elton's engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest 
              interest had entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank Churchill's 
              disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were assuming the most irresistible 
              form.--His wedding-day was named. He would soon be among them again; 
              Mr. Elton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk over the 
              first letter from Enscombe before &quot;Mr. Elton and his bride&quot; 
              was in every body's mouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma 
              grew sick at the sound. She had had three weeks of happy exemption 
              from Mr. Elton; and Harriet's mind, she had been willing to hope, 
              had been lately gaining strength. With Mr. Weston's ball in view 
              at least, there had been a great deal of insensibility to other 
              things; but it was now too evident that she had not attained such 
              a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach--new 
              carriage, bell-ringing, and all. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the 
              reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma 
              could give. Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that 
              Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but 
              it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing </p>
            <p>any effect, for ever agreed to, without being able to make their 
              opinions the same. Harriet listened submissively, and said &quot;it 
              was very true-- it was just as Miss Woodhouse described--it was 
              not worth while to think about them--and she would not think about 
              them any longer&quot; but no change of subject could avail, and 
              the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons 
              as before. At last Emma attacked her on another ground. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about 
              Mr. Elton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can 
              make me. You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake 
              I fell into. It was all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, 
              I assure you.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you-- 
              and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine 
              me in danger of forgetting it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager 
              exclamation. Emma continued, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think 
              less, talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake 
              rather, I would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more 
              important than my comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration 
              of what is your duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to 
              avoid the suspicions of others, to save your health and credit, 
              and restore your tranquillity. These are the motives which I have 
              been pressing on you. They are very important--and sorry I am that 
              you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them. My being saved 
              from pain is a very secondary consideration. I want you to save 
              yourself from greater pain. Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that 
              Harriet would not forget what was due--or rather what would be kind 
              by me.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The idea 
              of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom 
              she really loved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when 
              the violence of grief was comforted away, still remained powerful 
              enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life-- 
              Want gratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody 
              as I do for you!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look 
              and manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet 
              so well, nor valued her affection so highly before. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,&quot; said 
              she afterwards to herself. &quot;There is nothing to be compared 
              to it. Warmth and tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open 
              manner, will beat all the clearness of head in the world, for attraction, 
              I am sure it will. It is tenderness of heart which makes my dearfather 
              so generally beloved--which gives Isabella all her popularity.-- 
              I have it not--but I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet 
              is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives. Dear 
              Harriet!--I would not change you for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, 
              best-judging female breathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet 
              is worth a hundred such--And for a wife-- a sensible man's wife--it 
              is invaluable. I mention no names; but happy the man who changes 
              Emma for Harriet!&quot; </p>

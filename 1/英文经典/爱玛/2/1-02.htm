              VOLUME I<br>
            </p>
            <p align="center">CHAPTER II <br>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable 
              family, which for the last two or three generations had been rising 
              into gentility and property. He had received a good education, but, 
              on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become 
              indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers 
              were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social 
              temper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of 
              his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great 
              Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody 
              was surprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen 
              him, and who were full of pride and importance, which the connexion 
              would offend. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command 
              of her fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate--was 
              not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the 
              infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her 
              off with due decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not 
              produce much happiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in 
              it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made 
              him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness 
              of being in love with him; but though she had one sort ofpirit, 
              she had not the best. She had resolution enough to pursue her own 
              will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable 
              regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger, nor from missing the 
              luxuries of her former home. They lived beyond their income, but 
              still it was nothing in comparison of nscombe: she did not cease 
              to love her husband, but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain 
              Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills, 
              as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst 
              of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage, 
              he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to aintain. 
              From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. The 
              boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness 
              of his mother's, been the means of a sort of econciliation; and 
              Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own, nor any 
              other young creature of equal kindred to care for, ffered to take 
              the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease. Some 
              scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed 
              to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations, 
              the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the hurchills 
              and he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to 
              improve as he could. <br>
            </p>
            <p>A complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia 
              and engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good 
              way in London, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a 
              concern which brought just employment enough. He had still a small 
              house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days wer spent; and 
              between useful occupation and the pleasures of society, the next 
              eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away. He 
              had, by that time, realised an easy competence--enough to secure 
              the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had 
              always longed for--enough to marry a woman as portionless ven as 
              Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly 
              and social disposition. <br>
            </p>
            <p>It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his 
              schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, 
              it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could 
              purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward 
              to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till 
              they were accomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, 
              and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, 
              with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed 
              through. He had never been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured 
              him from that, even in his first marriage; but his second must shew 
              him how delightful a well-judging and truly amiable woman could 
              be, and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great 
              deal better to choose than to be chosen, to excite gratitude than 
              to feel it. <br>
            </p>
            <p>He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his 
              own; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up 
              as his uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have 
              him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely, 
              therefore, that he should ever want his father's assistance. His 
              father had no apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, 
              and governed her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's 
              nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect 
              one so dear, and, as he believed, so deservedly dear. He saw his 
              son every year in London, and was proud of him; and his fond report 
              of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of 
              pride in him too. He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to 
              the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively 
              curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little 
              returned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to 
              visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed, 
              as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place. There 
              was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry 
              drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates 
              returned the visit. Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to 
              come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was understood 
              that he had written to his new mother on the occasion. For a few 
              days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the 
              handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received. &quot;I suppose you have 
              heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to 
              Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed. 
              Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he 
              says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>It was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course, 
              formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing 
              attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and 
              a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of 
              congratulation which her marriage had already secured. She felt 
              herself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to 
              know how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only regret 
              was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her 
              had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, 
              without pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering an 
              hour's ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma 
              was of no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation 
              than most girls would have been, and had sense, and energy, and 
              spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through 
              its little difficulties and privations. And then there was such 
              comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield, so 
              convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's 
              disposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching 
              season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week 
              together. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude 
              to Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction---her 
              more than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and 
              so apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes 
              taken by surprize at his being still able to pity `poor Miss Taylor,' 
              when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, 
              or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband 
              to a carriage of her own. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's 
              giving a gentle sigh, and saying, &quot;Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She 
              would be very glad to stay.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of ceasing 
              to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse. 
              The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased 
              by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, 
              which had been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own 
              stomach could bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other 
              people to be different from himself. What was unwholesome to him 
              he regarded as unfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly 
              tried to dissuade them from having any wedding-cake at all, and 
              when that proved vain, as earnestly tried to prevent any body's 
              eating it. He had been at the pains of consulting Mr. Perry, the 
              apothecary, on the subject. Mr. Perry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike 
              man, whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's 
              life; and upon being applied to, he could not but acknowledge (though 
              it seemed rather against the bias of inclination) that wedding-cake 
              might certainly disagree with many--perhaps with most people, unless 
              taken moderately. With such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, 
              Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married 
              pair; but still the cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his 
              benevolent nerves till it was all gone. <br>
            </p>
            <p>There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys 
              being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands: 
              but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it. </p>

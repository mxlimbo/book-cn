            <p>This letter must make its way to Emma's feelings. She was obliged, 
              in spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it 
              all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she came to 
              her own name, it was irresistible; every line relating to herself 
              was interesting, and almost every line agreeable; and when this 
              charm ceased, the subject could still maintain itself, by the natural 
              return of her former regard for the writer, and the very strong 
              attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment. 
              She never stopt till she had gone through the whole; and though 
              it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong, yet he had 
              been less wrong than she had supposed--and he had suffered, and 
              was very sorry--and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston, and so much 
              in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself, that there 
              was no being severe; and could he have entered the room, she must 
              have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came 
              again, she desired him to read it. She was sure of Mrs. Weston's 
              wishing it to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. 
              Knightley, had seen so much to blame in his conduct. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I shall be very glad to look it over,&quot; said he; &quot;but 
              it seems long. I will take it home with me at night.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>But that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and 
              she must return it by him. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I would rather be talking to you,&quot; he replied; &quot;but 
              as it seems a matter of justice, it shall be done.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, &quot;Had 
              I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his 
              mother-in-law a few months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken 
              with such indifference.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with 
              a smile, observed, &quot;Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But 
              it is his way. One man's style must not be the rule of another's. 
              We will not be severe.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It will be natural for me,&quot; he added shortly afterwards, 
              &quot;to speak my opinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall 
              feel that I am near you. It will not be so great a loss of time: 
              but if you dislike it--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Not at all. I should wish it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He trifles here,&quot; said he, &quot;as to the temptation. 
              He knows he is wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He 
              ought not to have formed the engagement.--`His father's disposition:'-- 
              he is unjust, however, to his father. Mr. Weston's sanguine temper 
              was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions; but 
              Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to 
              gain it.--Very true; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And I have not forgotten,&quot; said Emma, &quot;how sure 
              you were that he might have come sooner if he would. You pass it 
              over very handsomely-- but you were perfectly right.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, 
              I think-- had you not been in the case--I should still have distrusted 
              him.&quot; </p>
            <p>When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole 
              of it aloud--all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake 
              of the head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely 
              of love, as the subject required; concluding, however, seriously, 
              and, after steady reflection, thus-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most 
              dangerous game. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.-- 
              No judge of his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by 
              his own wishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.-- 
              Fancying you to have fathomed his secret. Natural enough!-- his 
              own mind full of intrigue, that he should suspect it in others.--Mystery; 
              Finesse--how they pervert the understanding! My Emma, does not every 
              thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity 
              in all our dealings with each other?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's 
              account, which she could not give any sincere explanation of. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You had better go on,&quot; said she. <br>
            </p>
            <p>He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, &quot;the pianoforte! 
              Ah! That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young to 
              consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed 
              the pleasure. A boyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot comprehend a man's 
              wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she 
              would rather dispense with; and he did know that she would have 
              prevented the instrument's coming if she could.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>After this, he made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill's 
              confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call 
              for more than a word in passing. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I perfectly agree with you, sir,&quot;--was then his remark. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You did behave very shamefully. You never wrote a truer line.&quot; 
              And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of 
              their disagreement, and his persisting to act in direct opposition 
              to Jane Fairfax's sense of right, he made a fuller pause to say, 
              &quot;This is very bad.--He had induced her to place herself, for 
              his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness, and 
              it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering 
              unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend with, in 
              carrying on the orrespondence, than he could. He should have respected 
              even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers were all 
              reasonable. We must look to her one fault, and remember that she 
              had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to bear 
              that she should have been in such a state of punishment.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew 
              uncomfortable. Her own behaviour had been so very improper! She 
              was deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It was 
              all read, however, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest 
              remark; and, excepting one momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, 
              in the fear of giving pain--no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to 
              exist. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, 
              the Eltons,&quot; was his next observation.--&quot;His feelings 
              are natural.-- What! actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She 
              felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each-- 
              she dissolved it.--What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!--Well, 
              he must be a most extraordinary--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Nay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much he suffers.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I hope he does,&quot; replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming 
              the letter. &quot;`Smallridge!'--What does this mean? What is all 
              this?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's children-- 
              a dear friend of Mrs. Elton's--a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, 
              by the bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read--not 
              even of Mrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. 
              What a letter the man writes!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, there is feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered 
              in finding her ill.--Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being 
              fond of her. `Dearer, much dearer than ever.' I hope he may long 
              continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is 
              a very liberal thanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands.--`Happier 
              than I deserve.' Come, he knows himself there. `Miss Woodhouse calls 
              me the child of good fortune.'--Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, 
              were they?-- And a fine ending--and there is the letter. The child 
              of good fortune! That was your name for him, was it?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I 
              am; but still you must, at least I hope you must, think the better 
              of him for it. I hope it does him some service with you.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults of 
              inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinion 
              in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still 
              as he is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will 
              soon, it may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with 
              her, I am very ready to believe his character will improve, and 
              acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that 
              it wants. And now, let me talk to you of something else. I have 
              another person's interest at present so much at heart, that I cannot 
              think any longer about Frank Churchill. Ever since I left you this 
              morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work on one subject.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike 
              English, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in 
              love with, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking 
              the happiness of her father. Emma's answer was ready at the first 
              word. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;While her dear father lived, any change of condition must 
              be impossible for her. She could never quit him.&quot; Part only 
              of this answer, however, was admitted. The impossibility of her 
              quitting her father, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; 
              but the inadmissibility of any other change, he could not agree 
              to. He had been thinking it over most deeply, most intently; he 
              had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to 
              Donwell; he had wanted to believe it feasible, but his knowledge 
              of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long; and 
              now he confessed his persuasion, that such a transplantation would 
              be a risk of her father's comfort, perhaps even of his life, which 
              must not be hazarded. Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!--No, he 
              felt that it ought not to be attempted. But the plan which had arisen 
              on the sacrifice of this, he trusted his dearest Emma would not 
              find in any respect objectionable; it was, that he should be received 
              at Hartfield; that so long as her father's happiness in other words 
              his life--required Hartfield to continue her home, it should be 
              his likewise. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own 
              passing thoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected 
              it; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her. She 
              was sensible of all the affection it evinced. She felt that, in 
              quitting Donwell, he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence 
              of hours and habits; that in living constantly with her father,and 
              in no house of his own, there would be much, very much, to be borne 
              with. She promised to think of it, and advised him to think of it 
              more; but he was fully convinced, that no reflection could alter 
              his wishes or his opinion on the subject. He had given it, he could 
              assure her, very long and calm consideration; he had been walking 
              away from William Larkins the whole morning, to have his thoughts 
              to himself. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,&quot; cried Emma. 
              &quot;I am sure William Larkins will not like it. You must get his 
              consent before you ask mine.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised, 
              moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very 
              good scheme. <br>
            </p>
            <p>It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of 
              view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was 
              never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose 
              rights as heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. 
              Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy; 
              and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, 
              and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent 
              dislike of Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, 
              which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude 
              of the sister and the aunt. <br>
            </p>
            <p>This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield-- 
              the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became. His evils 
              seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, their mutual good 
              to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for herself in the 
              periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!-- Such a partner 
              in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase 
              of melancholy! <br>
            </p>
            <p>She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing 
              of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend, 
              who must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightful family 
              party which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in 
              mere charitable caution, be kept at a distance from. She would be 
              a loser in every way. Emma could not deplore her future absence 
              as any deduction from her own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet 
              would be rather a dead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl 
              herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing 
              her in such a state of unmerited punishment. <br>
            </p>
            <p>In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is, 
              supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. 
              Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;-- 
              not like Mr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so 
              truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be less 
              worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even of 
              Harriet, that she could be in love with more than three men in one 
              year. </p>

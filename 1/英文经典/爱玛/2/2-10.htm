            <p>The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered,was tranquillity 
              itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment, slumbering 
              on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near her, most 
              deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax, standing 
              with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most 
              happy countenance on seeing Emma again. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;This is a pleasure,&quot; said he, in rather a low voice, 
              &quot;coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated. 
              You find me trying to be useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What!&quot; said Mrs. Weston, &quot;have not you finished 
              it yet? you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith 
              at this rate.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I have not been working uninterruptedly,&quot; he replied, 
              &quot;I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument 
              stand steadily, it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, 
              I believe. You see we have been wedging one leg with paper. This 
              was very kind of you to be persuaded to come. I was almost afraid 
              you would be hurrying home.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently 
              employed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying 
              to make her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was 
              quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again. That she was not 
              immediately ready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her 
              nerves; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to 
              touch it without emotion; she must reason herself into the power 
              of performance; and Emma could not but pity such feelings, whatever 
              their origin, and could not but resolve never to expose them to 
              her neighbour again. <br>
            </p>
            <p>At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, 
              the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. 
              Mrs. Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; 
              Emma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every 
              proper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest 
              promise. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,&quot; said Frank Churchill, 
              with a smile at Emma, &quot;the person has not chosen ill. I heard 
              a good deal of Colonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness 
              of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and all that party 
              would particularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either 
              gave his friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. 
              Do not you think so?&quot; <br>
              <br>
              Jane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston 
              had been speaking to her at the same moment. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It is not fair,&quot; said Emma, in a whisper; &quot;mine 
              was a random guess. Do not distress her.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little 
              doubt and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he began again, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure 
              on this occasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, 
              and wonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument's 
              coming to hand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business 
              to be going forward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be 
              the consequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he 
              may have sent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to 
              time, to depend upon contingencies and conveniences?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering, 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,&quot; said she, 
              in a voice of forced calmness, &quot;I can imagine nothing with 
              any confidence. It must be all conjecture.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Conjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes 
              one conjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall 
              make this rivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, 
              when hard at work, if one talks at all;--your real workmen, I suppose, 
              hold their tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of 
              a word--Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it 
              is done. I have the pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring 
              your spectacles, healed for the present.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape 
              a little from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged 
              Miss Fairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;If you are very kind,&quot; said he, &quot;it will be one 
              of the waltzes we danced last night;--let me live them over again. 
              You did not enjoy them as I did; you appeared tired the whole time. 
              I believe you were glad we danced no longer; but I would have given 
              worlds-- all the worlds one ever has to give--for another half-hour.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>She played. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one 
              happy!-- If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played 
              something else. He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte, 
              and turning to Emma, said, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?--Cramer.-- 
              And here are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, 
              one might expect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful 
              of Colonel Campbell, was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have 
              no music here. I honour that part of the attention particularly; 
              it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily 
              done; nothing incomplete. True affection only could have prompted 
              it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being 
              amused; and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught 
              the remains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush 
              of consciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight, she 
              had less scruple in the amusement, and much less compunction with 
              respect to her.--This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was 
              apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings. <br>
            </p>
            <p>He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.-- 
              Emma took the opportunity of whispering, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You speak too plain. She must understand you.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not 
              in the least ashamed of my meaning.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken 
              up the idea.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. 
              I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. 
              If she does wrong, she ought to feel it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;She is not entirely without it, I think.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do not see much sign of it. She is playing Robin Adair 
              at this moment--his favourite.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried 
              Mr. Knightley on horse-back not far off. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible, 
              just to thank him. I will not open the window here; it would give 
              you all cold; but I can go into my mother's room you know. I dare 
              say he will come in when he knows who is here. Quite delightful 
              to have you all meet so!--Our little room so honoured!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening 
              the casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention, 
              and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard 
              by the others, as if it had passed within the same apartment. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;How d' ye do?--how d'ye do?--Very well, I thank you. So obliged 
              to you for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother 
              just ready for us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some 
              friends here.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be 
              heard in his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say, 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you 
              all, but particularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she 
              caught no cold last night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax 
              is.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would 
              hear her in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. 
              Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook 
              her head in steady scepticism. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage,&quot; 
              resumed Miss Bates. <br>
            </p>
            <p>He cut her short with, <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I am going to Kingston. Can I do anything for you?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! dear, Kingston--are you?--Mrs. Cole was saying the other 
              day she wanted something from Kingston.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for you?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?-- 
              Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new 
              pianoforte. Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said he, in a deliberating manner, &quot;for 
              five minutes, perhaps.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite 
              delightful; so many friends!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I 
              must get on to Kingston as fast as I can.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, 
              and hear the pianoforte.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Well, I am so sorry!--Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful 
              party last night; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such 
              dancing?-- Was not it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank 
              Churchill; I never saw any thing equal to it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I 
              suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every 
              thing that passes. And (raising his voice still more) I do not see 
              why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax 
              dances very well; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance 
              player, without exception, in England. Now, if your friends have 
              any gratitude, they will say something pretty loud about you and 
              me in return; but I cannot stay to hear it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence-- 
              so shocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What is the matter now?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said 
              you had a great many, and now you have not one left. We really are 
              so shocked! Mrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned 
              it here. </p>
            <p>You should not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. 
              He never can bear to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid 
              now, and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned. . . . 
              Well, (returning to the room,) I have not been able to succeed. 
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Knightley cannot stop. He is going to Kingston. He asked me 
              if he could do any thing. . . .&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Yes,&quot; said Jane, &quot;we heard his kind offers, we heard 
              every thing.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, 
              the door was open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke 
              loud. You must have heard every thing to be sure. `Can I do any 
              thing for you at Kingston?' said he; so I just mentioned. . . . 
              Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must you be going?--You seem but just come--so 
              very obliging of you.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already 
              lasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was 
              perceived to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking 
              leave also, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young 
              ladies to Hartfield gates, before they set off for Randalls. </p>

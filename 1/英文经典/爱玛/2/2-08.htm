            <p>Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father's dinner 
              waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too 
              anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray 
              any imperfection which could be concealed. <br>
            </p>
            <p>He came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with 
              a very good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of 
              what he had done. He had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal 
              any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve 
              his spirits. He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, 
              after seeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly 
              things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people 
              in an impudent way. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is 
              not always folly.--It depends upon the character of those who handle 
              it. Mr. Knightley, he is not a trifling, silly young man. If he 
              were, he would have done this differently. He would either have 
              gloried in the achievement, or been ashamed of it. There would have 
              been either the ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind 
              too weak to defend its own vanities.--No, I am perfectly sure that 
              he is not trifling or silly.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, and 
              for a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, 
              and by inference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself; 
              of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness 
              into her air; and of fancying what the observations of all those 
              might be, who were now seeing them together for the first time. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at 
              Mr. Cole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings 
              of Mr. Elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed 
              her more than his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Her father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs. 
              Goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she 
              left the house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together 
              after dinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty 
              of her dress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her power, 
              by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, 
              for whatever unwilling self-denial his care of their constitution 
              might have obliged them to practise during the meal.--She had provided 
              a plentiful dinner for them; she wished she could know that they 
              had been allowed to eat it. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased 
              to see that it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping no 
              horses, having little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, 
              and independence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get about as 
              he could, and not use his carriage so often as became the owner 
              of Donwell Abbey. She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation 
              while warm from her heart, for he stopped to hand her out. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;This is coming as you should do,&quot; said she; &quot;like 
              a gentleman.-- I am quite glad to see you.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He thanked her, observing, &quot;How lucky that we should arrive 
              at the same moment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, 
              I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman 
              than usual.-- You might not have distinguished how I came, by my 
              look or manner.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look 
              of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they 
              know to be beneath them. You think you carry it off very well, I 
              dare say, but with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected 
              unconcern; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances. 
              Now you have nothing to try for. You are not afraid of being supposed 
              ashamed. You are not striving to look taller than any body else. 
              Now I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with 
              you.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Nonsensical girl!&quot; was his reply, but not at all in 
              anger. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party 
              as with Mr. Knightley. She was received with a cordial respect which 
              could not but please, and given all the consequence she could wish 
              for. When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest 
              of admiration were for her, from both husband and wife;the son approached 
              her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object, 
              and at dinner she found him seated by her--and, as she firmly believed, 
              not without some dexterity on his side. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a 
              proper unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage 
              of naming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox's 
              family, the lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to 
              come in the evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; 
              but already, at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject of 
              conversation to be general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were 
              talked over, Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the 
              pleasantness of her neighbour. The first remote sound to which she 
              felt herself obliged to attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. 
              Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to 
              be very interesting. She listened, and found it well worth listening 
              to. That very dear part of Emma, her fancy, received an amusing 
              supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss 
              Bates, and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the 
              sight of a pianoforte--a very elegant looking instrument--not a 
              grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of 
              the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, 
              and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and explanations on 
              Miss Bates's, was, that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood's 
              the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece--entirely 
              unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates's account, Jane herself 
              was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could possibly 
              have ordered it-- but now, they were both perfectly satisfied that 
              it could be from only one quarter;--of course it must be from Colonel 
              Campbell. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;One can suppose nothing else,&quot; added Mrs. Cole, &quot;and 
              I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But 
              Jane, it seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word 
              was said about it. She knows their ways best; but I should not consider 
              their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present. 
              They might chuse to surprize her.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the 
              subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell, 
              and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there 
              were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and 
              still listen to Mrs. Cole. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that 
              has given me more satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that 
              Jane Fairfax, who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. 
              It seemed quite a shame, especially considering how many houses 
              there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away. This 
              is like giving ourselves a slap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday 
              I was telling Mr. Cole, I really was ashamed to look at our new 
              grand pianoforte in the drawing-room, while I do not know one note 
              from another, and our little girls, who are but just beginning, 
              perhaps may never make any thing of it; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, 
              who is mistress of music, has not any thing of the nature of an 
              instrument, not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world, to 
              amuse herself with.--I was saying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday, 
              and he quite agreed with me; only he is so particularly fond of 
              music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase, 
              hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally 
              to put it to a better use than we can; and that really is the reason 
              why the instrument was bought--or else I am sure we ought to be 
              ashamed of it.--We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be 
              prevailed with to try it this evening.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing 
              more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's, 
              turned to Frank Churchill. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Why do you smile?&quot; said she. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Nay, why do you?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's 
              being so rich and so liberal.--It is a handsome present.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I rather wonder that it was never made before.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long 
              before.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument-- 
              which must now be shut up in London, untouched by any body.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large 
              for Mrs. Bates's house.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You may say what you chuse--but your countenance testifies 
              that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit 
              for acuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall 
              probably suspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do 
              not see what there is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the 
              person, who can be?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. 
              She must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument 
              would be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, 
              is more like a young woman's scheme than an elderly man's. It is 
              Mrs. Dixon, I dare say. I told you that your suspicions wouldguide 
              mine.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend Mr. 
              Dixon in them.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mr. Dixon.--Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it 
              must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking 
              the other day, you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her 
              performance.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea 
              which I had entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the 
              good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot 
              help suspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend,he 
              had the misfortune to fall in love with her, or that he became conscious 
              of a little attachment on her side. One might guess twenty things 
              without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure there must be 
              a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of 
              going with the Campbells to Ireland. Here, she must be leading a 
              life of privation and penance; there it would have been all enjoyment. 
              As to the pretence of trying her native air, I look upon that as 
              a mere excuse.--In the summer it might have passed; but what can 
              any body's native air do for them in the months of January, February, 
              and March? Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose 
              in most cases of delicate health, and I dare say in her's. I do 
              not require you to adopt all my suspicions, though you make so noble 
              a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell you what they are.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. 
              Mr. Dixon's preference of her music to her friend's, I can answer 
              for being very decided.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?-- 
              A water party; and by some accident she was falling overboard. He 
              caught her.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He did. I was there--one of the party.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course, 
              for it seems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there, I think 
              I should have made some discoveries.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the 
              fact, that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that 
              Mr. Dixon caught her.--It was the work of a moment. And though the 
              consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable--indeed 
              I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable 
              again-- yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar 
              anxiety to be observable. I do not mean to say, however, that you 
              might not have made discoveries.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              The conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to share 
              in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, 
              and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when 
              the table was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed 
              exactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored, 
              Emma said, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted 
              to know a little more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon 
              it, we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of 
              it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax 
              knows it is not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed 
              at first. She would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on 
              them. I may not have convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced 
              myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your 
              reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, 
              while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, 
              I saw it only as paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural 
              thing in the world. But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how 
              much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female 
              friendship. And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering 
              of love.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>There was no occasion to press the matter farther. The conviction 
              seemed real; he looked as if he felt it. She said no more, other 
              subjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; 
              the dessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked to 
              and admired amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever things 
              said, a few downright silly, but by much the larger proportion neither 
              the one nor the other--nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull 
              repetitions, old news, and heavy jokes. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other 
              ladies, in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the 
              entree of her own particular little friend; and if she could not 
              exult in her dignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming 
              sweetness and the artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice 
              in that light, cheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed 
              her so many alleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs 
              of disappointed affection. There she sat--and who would have guessed 
              how many tears she had been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely 
              dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile 
              and look pretty, and say nothing, was enough for the happiness of 
              the present hour. Jane Fairfax did look and move superior; but Emma 
              suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet, 
              very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved--yes, 
              of having loved even Mr. Elton in vain--by the surrender of all 
              the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband 
              of her friend. <br>
            </p>
            <p>In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach 
              her. She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much 
              in the secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest 
              fair, and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, 
              the subject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush 
              of consciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush 
              of guilt which accompanied the name of &quot;my excellent friend 
              Colonel Campbell.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested 
              by the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her 
              perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask 
              and to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of 
              that wish of saying as little about it as possible, which she plainly 
              read in the fair heroine's countenance. <br>
            </p>
            <p>They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first 
              of the early was Frank Churchill. In he walked, the first and the 
              handsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss 
              Bates and her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side 
              of the circle, where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find 
              a seat by her, would not sit at all. Emma divined what every body 
              present must be thinking. She was his object, and every body must 
              perceive it. She introduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, 
              at convenient moments afterwards, heard what each thought of the 
              other. &quot;He had never seen so lovely a face, and was delighted 
              with her naivete.&quot; And she, &quot;Only to be sure it was paying 
              him too great a compliment, but she did think there were some looks 
              a little like Mr. Elton.&quot; Emma restrained her indignation, 
              and only turned from her in silence. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on 
              first glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to 
              avoid speech. He told her that he had been impatient to leave the 
              dining-room-- hated sitting long--was always the first to move when 
              he could-- that his father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, 
              were left very busy over parish business--that as long as he had 
              staid, however, it had been pleasant enough, as he had found them 
              in general a set of gentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely 
              of Highbury altogether--thought it so abundant in agreeable families-- 
              that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather 
              too much. She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire--the 
              extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort; and could 
              make out from his answers that, as far as Enscombe was concerned, 
              there was very little going on, that their visitings were among 
              a range of great families, none very near; and that even when days 
              were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even chance that 
              Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going; that they 
              made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that, though he had 
              his separate engagements, it was not without difficulty, without 
              considerable address at times, that he could get away, or introduce 
              an acquaintance for a night. She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, 
              and that Highbury, taken at its best, might reasonably please a 
              young man who had more retirement at home than he liked. His importance 
              at Enscombe was very evident. He did not boast, but it naturally 
              betrayed itself, that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle 
              could do nothing, and on her laughing and noticing it, he owned 
              that he believed (excepting one or two points) he could with time 
              persuade her to any thing. One of those points on which his influence 
              failed, he then mentioned. He had wanted very much to go abroad--had 
              been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel--but she would not 
              hear of it. This had happened the year before. Now, he said, he 
              was beginning to have no longer the same wish. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed 
              to be good behaviour to his father. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I have made a most wretched discovery,&quot; said he, after 
              a short pause.-- &quot;I have been here a week to-morrow--half my 
              time. I never knew days fly so fast. A week to-morrow!--And I have 
              hardly begun to enjoy myself. But just got acquainted with Mrs. 
              Weston, and others!-- I hate the recollection.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole 
              day, out of so few, in having your hair cut.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No,&quot; said he, smiling, &quot;that is no subject of regret 
              at all.I have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe 
              myself fit to be seen.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself 
              obliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole. 
              When Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored 
              as before, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room 
              at Miss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What is the matter?&quot; said she. <br>
            </p>
            <p>He started. &quot;Thank you for rousing me,&quot; he replied. &quot;I 
              believe I have been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done 
              her hair in so odd a way--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep 
              my eyes from her. I never saw any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This 
              must be a fancy of her own. I see nobody else looking like her!-- 
              I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion. Shall I?-- 
              Yes, I will--I declare I will--and you shall see how she takes it;-- 
              whether she colours.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before 
              Miss Fairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young 
              lady, as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, 
              exactly in front of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish 
              nothing. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;This is the luxury of a large party,&quot; said she:--&quot;one 
              can get near every body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am 
              longing to talk to you. I have been making discoveries and forming 
              plans, just like yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is 
              fresh. Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here?&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              &quot;How?--They were invited, were not they?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of 
              their coming?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how 
              very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late 
              at night, and cold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, 
              though I never saw her appear to more advantage, it struck me that 
              she was heated, and would therefore be particularly liable to take 
              cold. Poor girl! I could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as 
              Mr. Weston came into the room, and I could get at him, I spoke to 
              him about the carriage. You may guess how readily he came into my 
              wishes; and having his approbation, I made my way directly to Miss 
              Bates, to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before 
              it took us home; for I thought it would be making her comfortable 
              at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you may be 
              sure. `Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but with many, 
              many thanks--`there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's 
              carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.' I was quite 
              surprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized. Such 
              a very kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!-- the sort 
              of thing that so few men would think of. And, in short, from knowing 
              his usual ways, I am very much inclined to think that it was for 
              their accommodation the carriage was used at all. I do suspect he 
              would not have had a pair of horses for himself, and that it was 
              only as an excuse for assisting them.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very likely,&quot; said Emma--&quot;nothing more likely. 
              I know no man more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to 
              do anything really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. 
              He is not a gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, 
              considering Jane Fairfax's ill-health, would appear a case of humanity 
              to him;--and for an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody 
              whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses 
              to-day--for we arrived together; and I laughed at him about it, 
              but he said not a word that could betray.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Mrs. Weston, smiling, &quot;you give him 
              credit for more simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance 
              than I do; for while Miss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted 
              into my head, and I have never been able to get it out again. The 
              more I think of it, the more probable it appears. In short, I have 
              made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax. See the consequence 
              of keeping you company!--What do you say to it?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!&quot; exclaimed Emma. &quot;Dear 
              Mrs. Weston, how could you think of such a thing?--Mr. Knightley!--Mr. 
              Knightley must not marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out 
              from Donwell?--Oh! no, no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at 
              all consent to Mr. Knightley's marrying; and I am sure it is not 
              at all likely. I am amazed that you should think of such a thing.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. 
              I do not want the match--I do not want to injure dear little Henry-- 
              but the idea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley 
              really wished to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry's 
              account, a boy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.-- 
              Mr. Knightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot 
              adopt it now. And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you 
              very well know.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But the imprudence of such a match!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation 
              than what you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell 
              you, would be quite enough to account for the horses. He has a great 
              regard for the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax-- 
              and is always glad to shew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, 
              do not take to match-making. You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress 
              of the Abbey!--Oh! no, no;--every feeling revolts. For his own sake, 
              I would not have him do so mad a thing.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Imprudent, if you please--but not mad. Excepting inequality 
              of fortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing 
              unsuitable.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has 
              not the least idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should 
              he marry?-- He is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, 
              and his sheep, and his library, and all the parish to manage; and 
              he is extremely fond of his brother's children. He has no occasion 
              to marry, either to fill up his time or his heart.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he 
              really loves Jane Fairfax--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Nonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way 
              of love, I am sure he does not. He would do any good to her, or 
              her family; but--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Mrs. Weston, laughing, &quot;perhaps the 
              greatest good he could do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable 
              home.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to 
              himself; a very shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear 
              to have Miss Bates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey, 
              and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying 
              Jane?-- `So very kind and obliging!--But he always had been such 
              a very kind neighbour!' And then fly off, through half a sentence, 
              to her mother's old petticoat. `Not that it was such a very old 
              petticoat either--for still it would last a great while--and, indeed, 
              she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong.'&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against 
              my conscience. And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would 
              be much disturbed by Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. 
              She might talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he 
              would only talk louder, and drown her voice. But the question is 
              not, whether it would be a bad connexion for him, but whether he 
              wishes it; and I think he does. I have heard him speak, and so must 
              you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax! The interest he takes in her-- 
              his anxiety about her health--his concern that she should have no 
              happier prospect! I have heard him express himself so warmly on 
              those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte, 
              and of her voice! I have heard him say that he could listen to her 
              for ever. Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred 
              to me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody-- though 
              we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from 
              the Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley? I cannot help suspecting 
              him. I think he is just the person to do it, even without being 
              in love.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But 
              I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr. Knightley 
              does nothing mysteriously.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly; 
              oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the 
              common course of things, occur to him.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would 
              have told her so.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have 
              a very strong notion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularly 
              silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as 
              you have many a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of 
              attachment-- I believe nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only 
              shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying 
              Jane Fairfax.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma 
              rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston 
              was the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the 
              room shewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;-- 
              and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse 
              would do them the honour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, 
              in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been 
              seeing nothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, 
              followed Mr. Cole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as, 
              in every respect, it suited Emma best to lead, she gave a very proper 
              compliance. She knew the limitations of her own powers too well 
              to attempt more than she could perform with credit; she wanted neither 
              taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable, 
              and could accompany her own voice well. One accompaniment to her 
              song took her agreeably by surprize--a second, slightly but correctly 
              taken by Frank Churchill. Her pardon was duly begged at the close 
              of the song, and every thing usual followed. He was accused of having 
              a delightful voice, and a perfect knowledge of music; which was 
              properly denied; and that he knew nothing of the matter, and had 
              no voice at all, roundly asserted. They sang together once more; 
              and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax, whose performance, 
              both vocal and instrumental, she never could attempt to conceal 
              from herself, was infinitely superior to her own. <br>
            </p>
            <p>With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from 
              the numbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang 
              again. They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. 
              But the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew 
              away half Emma's mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on 
              the subject of Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds 
              of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions. Her objections 
              to Mr. Knightley's marrying did not in the least subside. She could 
              see nothing but evil in it. It would be a great disappointment to 
              Mr. John Knightley; consequently to Isabella. A real injury to the 
              children--a most mortifying change, and material loss to them all;--a 
              very great deduction from her father's daily comfort--and, as to 
              herself, she could not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at 
              Donwell Abbey. A Mrs. Knightley for them all to give way to!--No--Mr. 
              Knightley must never marry. Little Henry must remain the heir of 
              Donwell. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. 
              They talked at first only of the performance. His admiration was 
              certainly very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would 
              not have struck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she began 
              to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though 
              his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed 
              it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness 
              of his own. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I often feel concern,&quot; said she, &quot;that I dare not 
              make our carriage more useful on such occasions. It is not that 
              I am without the wish; but you know how impossible my father would 
              deem it that James should put-to for such a purpose.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,&quot; 
              he replied;-- &quot;but you must often wish it, I am sure.&quot; 
              And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction, that 
              she must proceed another step. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;This present from the Campbells,&quot; said she--&quot;this 
              pianoforte is very kindly given.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, and without the smallest apparent 
              embarrassment.-- &quot;But they would have done better had they 
              given her notice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure 
              is not enhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I 
              should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley 
              had had no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he were 
              entirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there were no actual 
              preference--remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of 
              Jane's second song, her voice grew thick. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That will do,&quot; said he, when it was finished, thinking 
              aloud-- &quot;you have sung quite enough for one evening--now be 
              quiet.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Another song, however, was soon begged for. &quot;One more;--they 
              would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask 
              for one more.&quot; And Frank Churchill was heard to say, &quot;I 
              think you could manage this without effort; the first part is so 
              very trifling. The strength of the song falls on the second.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Knightley grew angry. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That fellow,&quot; said he, indignantly, &quot;thinks of 
              nothing but shewing off his own voice. This must not be.&quot; And 
              touching Miss Bates, who at that moment passed near--&quot;Miss 
              Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this 
              manner? Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on her.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even 
              to be grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther 
              singing. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss Woodhouse 
              and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon (within 
              five minutes) the proposal of dancing-- originating nobody exactly 
              knew where--was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that 
              every thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs. 
              Weston, capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning 
              an irresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill, </p>
            <p>coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma, had secured her 
              hand, and led her up to the top. <br>
            </p>
            <p>While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves 
              off, Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving 
              on her voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of 
              Mr. Knightley. This would be a trial. He was no dancer in general. 
              If he were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might 
              augur something. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was talking 
              to Mrs. Cole-- he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by 
              somebody else, and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; 
              and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not 
              more than five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the 
              suddenness of it made it very delightful, and she found herself 
              well matched in a partner. They were a couple worth looking at. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It was 
              growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her 
              mother's account. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted 
              to begin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful, 
              and have done. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Perhaps it is as well,&quot; said Frank Churchill, as he 
              attended Emma to her carriage. &quot;I must have asked Miss Fairfax, 
              and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me, after your's.&quot;

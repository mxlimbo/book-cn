            <p>Mrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her safety; and if 
              the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it 
              was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl. She had been 
              decided in wishing for a Miss Weston. She would not acknowledge 
              that it was with any view of making a match for her, hereafter, 
              with either of Isabella's sons; but she was convinced that a daughter 
              would suit both father and mother best. It would be a great comfort 
              to Mr. Weston, as he grew older-- and even Mr. Weston might be growing 
              older ten years hence--to have his fireside enlivened by the sports 
              and the nonsense, the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished 
              from home; and Mrs. Weston-- no one could doubt that a daughter 
              would be most to her; and it would be quite a pity that any one 
              who so well knew how to teach, should not have their powers in exercise 
              again. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,&quot; 
              she continued--&quot;like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis, 
              in Madame de Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see 
              her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That is,&quot; replied Mr. Knightley, &quot;she will indulge 
              her even more than she did you, and believe that she does not indulge 
              her at all. It will be the only difference.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Poor child!&quot; cried Emma; &quot;at that rate, what will 
              become of her?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeable 
              in infancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I am losing 
              all my bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who 
              am owing all my happiness to you, would not it be horrible ingratitude 
              in me to be severe on them?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma laughed, and replied: &quot;But I had the assistance of all 
              your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I 
              doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Do you?--I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:-- 
              Miss Taylor gave you principles. You must have done well. My interference 
              was quite as likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for 
              you to say, what right has he to lecture me?-- and I am afraid very 
              natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. 
              I do not believe I did you any good. The good was all to myself, 
              by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me. I could 
              not think about you so much without doating on you, faults and all; 
              and by dint of fancying so many errors, have been in love with you 
              ever since you were thirteen at least.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am sure you were of use to me,&quot; cried Emma. &quot;I 
              was very often influenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own 
              at the time. I am very sure you did me good. And if poor little 
              Anna Weston is to be spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in 
              you to do as much for her as you have done for me, except falling 
              in love with her when she is thirteen.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with 
              one of your saucy looks--`Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; 
              papa says I may, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'--something which, 
              you knew, I did not approve. In such cases my interference was giving 
              you two bad feelings instead of one.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold 
              my speeches in such affectionate remembrance.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;`Mr. Knightley.'--You always called me, `Mr. Knightley;' 
              and, from habit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it 
              is formal. I want you to call me something else, but I do not know 
              what.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I remember once calling you `George,' in one of my amiable 
              fits, about ten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend 
              you; but, as you made no objection, I never did it again.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And cannot you call me `George' now?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but `Mr. Knightley.' 
              I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, 
              by calling you Mr. K.--But I will promise,&quot; she added presently, 
              laughing and blushing--&quot;I will promise to call you once by 
              your Christian name. I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess 
              where;--in the building in which N. takes M. for better, for worse.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important 
              service which his better sense would have rendered her, to the advice 
              which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies--her 
              wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a subject.--She 
              could not enter on it.-- Harriet was very seldom mentioned between 
              them. This, on his side, might merely proceed from her not being 
              thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy, 
              and a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship were 
              declining. She was aware herself, that, parting under any other 
              circumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and 
              that her intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly 
              did, on Isabella's letters. He might observe that it was so. The 
              pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him, was very 
              little inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could 
              be expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits, 
              which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; 
              but, since that business had been over, she did not appear to find 
              Harriet different from what she had known her before.-- Isabella, 
              to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been 
              equal to playing with the children, it would not have escaped her. 
              Emma's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet's 
              being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be a month at 
              least. Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August, 
              and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;John does not even mention your friend,&quot; said Mr. Knightley. 
              &quot;Here is his answer, if you like to see it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage. 
              Emma accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all 
              alive to know what he would say about it, and not at all checked 
              by hearing that her friend was unmentioned. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;John enters like a brother into my happiness,&quot; continued 
              Mr. Knightley, &quot;but he is no complimenter; and though I well 
              know him to have, likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, 
              he is so far from making flourishes, that any other young woman 
              might think him rather cool in her praise. But I am not afraid of 
              your seeing what he writes.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He writes like a sensible man,&quot; replied Emma, when she 
              had read the letter. &quot;I honour his sincerity. It is very plain 
              that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my 
              side, but that he is not without hope of my growing, in time, as 
              worthy of your affection, as you think me already. Had he said any 
              thing to bear a different construction, I should not have believed 
              him.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My Emma, he means no such thing. He only means--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the 
              two,&quot; interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile--&quot;much 
              less, perhaps, than he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony 
              or reserve on the subject.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Emma, my dear Emma--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; she cried with more thorough gaiety, &quot;if you 
              fancy your brother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear 
              father is in the secret, and hear his opinion. Depend upon it, he 
              will be much farther from doing you justice. He will think all the 
              happiness, all the advantage, on your side of the question; all 
              the merit on mine. I wish I may not sink into `poor Emma' with him 
              at once.-- His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go 
              no farther.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah!&quot; he cried, &quot;I wish your father might be half 
              as easily convinced as John will be, of our having every right that 
              equal worth can give, to be happy together. I am amused by one part 
              of John's letter-- did you notice it?--where he says, that my information 
              did not take him wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation 
              of hearing something of the kind.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your 
              having some thoughts of marrying. He had no idea of me. He seems 
              perfectly unprepared for that.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far 
              into my feelings. What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious 
              of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare 
              him at this time for my marrying any more than at another.-- But 
              it was so, I suppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was 
              staying with them the other day. I believe I did not play with the 
              children quite so much as usual. I remember one evening the poor 
              boys saying, `Uncle seems always tired now.'&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other 
              persons' reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently 
              recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view 
              that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved 
              first to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.-- But how to 
              break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself to do it, 
              in such an hour of Mr. Knightley's absence, or when it came to the 
              point her heart would have failed her, and she must have put it 
              off; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time, and follow up 
              the beginning she was to make.--She was forced to speak, and to 
              speak cheerfully too. She must not make it a more decided subject 
              of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself. She must not appear 
              to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits she could command, 
              she prepared him first for something strange, and then, in a few 
              words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be obtained--which, 
              she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty, since it was 
              a plan to promote the happiness of all-- she and Mr. Knightley meant 
              to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition 
              of that person's company whom she knew he loved, next to his daughters 
              and Mrs. Weston, best in the world. </p>
            <p>Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he 
              tried earnestly to dissuade her from it. She was reminded, more 
              than once, of having always said she would never marry, and assured 
              that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single; and 
              told of poor Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do. 
              Emma hung about him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must 
              be so; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, 
              whose marriages taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a 
              melancholy change: but she was not going from Hartfield; she should 
              be always there; she was introducing no change in their numbers 
              or their comforts but for the better; and she was very sure that 
              he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley always 
              at hand, when he were once got used to the idea.--Did he not love 
              Mr. Knightley very much?-- He would not deny that he did, she was 
              sure.--Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who 
              was so useful to him,who so ready to write his letters, who so glad 
              to assist him?-- Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached to him?--Would 
              not he like to have him always on the spot?--Yes. That was all very 
              true. Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he should be glad 
              to see him every day;--but they did see him every day as it was.--Why 
              could not they go on as they had done? <br>
              <br>
              Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome, 
              the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.-- 
              To Emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's, whose 
              fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and 
              he was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.-- 
              They had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters 
              of the strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the 
              first meeting, to consider the subject in the most serviceable light--first, 
              as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one-- well aware of the nearly 
              equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.--It 
              was agreed upon, as what was to be; and every body by whom he was 
              used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness; 
              and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it, he began 
              to think that some time or other-- in another year or two, perhaps--it 
              might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that 
              she said to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely 
              surprized, never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair 
              to her; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and 
              had no scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard 
              for Mr. Knightley, as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma; 
              and it was in every respect so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable 
              a connexion, and in one respect, one point of the highest importance, 
              so peculiarly eligible, so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed 
              as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature, 
              and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having 
              thought of it, and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men 
              in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own 
              home for Hartfield! And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear 
              with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!-- 
              The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always 
              felt in her husband's plans and her own, for a marriage between 
              Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield 
              had been a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr. Weston 
              than by herself--but even he had never been able to finish the subject 
              better than by saying--&quot;Those matters will take care of themselves; 
              the young people will find a way.&quot; But here there was nothing 
              to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It was all 
              right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth the name. 
              It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and 
              without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections 
              as these, was one of the happiest women in the world. If any thing 
              could increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would 
              soon have outgrown its first set of caps. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. 
              Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough 
              to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.-- He saw the advantages 
              of the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his 
              wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end 
              of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen 
              it. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;It is to be a secret, I conclude,&quot; said he. &quot;These 
              matters are always a secret, till it is found out that every body 
              knows them. Only let me be told when I may speak out.--I wonder 
              whether Jane has any suspicion.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on 
              that point. He told her the news. Was not she like a daughter, his 
              eldest daughter?--he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present, 
              it passed, of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, 
              immediately afterwards. It was no more than the principals were 
              prepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known 
              at Randalls, how soon it would be over Highbury; and were thinking 
              of themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle, with 
              great sagacity. <br>
            </p>
            <p>In general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think 
              him, and others might think her, the most in luck. One set might 
              recommend their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for 
              the John Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements among 
              their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious objection 
              raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.--There, the surprize 
              was not softened by any satisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about 
              it, compared with his wife; he only hoped &quot;the young lady's 
              pride would now be contented;&quot; and supposed &quot;she had always 
              meant to catch Knightley if she could;&quot; and, on the point of 
              living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, &quot;Rather he than 
              I!&quot;-- But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--&quot;Poor 
              Knightley! poor fellow!--sad business for him.--She was extremely 
              concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good qualities.-- 
              How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in love-- 
              not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all 
              pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and 
              dine with them whenever they asked him! But that would be all over 
              now.-- Poor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for 
              her. Oh! no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water 
              on every thing.--Extremely disagreeable! But she was not at all 
              sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking 
              plan, living together. It would never do. She knew a family near 
              Maple Grove who had tried it, and been obliged to separate before 
              the end of the first quarter. </p>

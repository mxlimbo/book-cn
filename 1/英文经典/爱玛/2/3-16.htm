              VOLUME III<br>
            </p>
            <p align="center">CHAPTER XVI</p>
            <p align="center"> </p>
            <p>It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous 
              as herself to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough 
              by letter. How much worse, had they been obliged to meet! <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, without 
              reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied 
              there was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it 
              in her style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.-- 
              It might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel 
              only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation; </p>
            <p>and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking 
              it, without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss. Harriet 
              really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. 
              John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health 
              was a recommendation to her--and though not so fond of a dentist 
              as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet under 
              her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister's side, Emma proposed 
              it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.-- Harriet was 
              to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was to be conveyed 
              in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was all arranged, it was all completed, 
              and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she could 
              talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that 
              sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had 
              haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, 
              how much might at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring 
              by the feelings which she had led astray herself. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made 
              perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she 
              could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and 
              employment, which must be averting the past, and carrying her out 
              of herself. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the 
              place in her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication 
              before her, one which she only could be competent to make-- the 
              confession of her engagement to her father; but she would have nothing 
              to do with it at present.--She had resolved to defer the disclosure 
              till Mrs. Weston were safe and well. No additional agitation should 
              be thrown at this period among those she loved-- and the evil should 
              not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.--A 
              fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind, to crown every 
              warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ 
              half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.-- 
              She ought to go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance 
              of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill. 
              It would be a secret satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity 
              of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should 
              attend to any thing Jane might communicate. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had 
              not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor 
              Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion, 
              though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.-- The 
              fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured of 
              their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.-- 
              She heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor 
              Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No; she heard 
              nothing but the instant reply of, &quot;Beg her to walk up;&quot;--and 
              a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming 
              eagerly forward, as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.-- 
              Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging. There 
              was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every thing 
              which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.-- She came 
              forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very feeling 
              tone, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible 
              for me to express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being 
              so entirely without words.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, 
              if the sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not 
              checked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly 
              and all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest 
              shake of the hand. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, which 
              accounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have wished 
              Mrs. Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience with 
              every body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness, 
              she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts, and 
              understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being 
              in Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with 
              what was still a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it 
              immediately in the expression of her face; and while paying her 
              own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing to attend to the good 
              old lady's replies, she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of 
              mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud 
              to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple and gold reticule 
              by her side, saying, with significant nods, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall 
              not want opportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essential 
              already. I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, 
              and is not offended. You see how delightfully she writes. Oh! she 
              is a sweet creature! You would have doated on her, had you gone.--But 
              not a word more. Let us be discreet-- quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You 
              remember those lines-- I forget the poem at this moment: <br>
            </p>
            <p> &quot;For when a lady's in the case, </p>
            <p> &quot;You know all other things give place.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              Now I say, my dear, in our case, for lady, read----mum! a word to 
              the wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I? But I want to 
              set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--My representation, you see, 
              has quite appeased her.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>And again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates's 
              knitting, she added, in a half whisper, </p>
            <p>&quot;I mentioned no names, you will observe.--Oh! no; cautious 
              as a minister of state. I managed it extremely well.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on every 
              possible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmony 
              of the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed 
              with, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend 
              here is charmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry 
              the highest credit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at 
              Jane.) Upon my word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short 
              time!-- Oh! if you had seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!&quot;-- 
              And when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther, 
              &quot;We do not say a word of any assistance that Perry might have; 
              not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh! no; Perry 
              shall have all the credit.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,&quot; 
              she shortly afterwards began, &quot;since the party to Box Hill. 
              Very pleasant party. But yet I think there was something wanting. 
              Things did not seem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the 
              spirits of some.--So it appeared to me at least, but I might be 
              mistaken. However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one to 
              go again. What say you both to our collecting the same party, and 
              exploring to Box Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?-- It 
              must be the same party, you know, quite the same party, not one 
              exception.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being 
              diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting, 
              she supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to 
              say every thing. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It 
              is impossible to say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane's 
              prospects-- that is, I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.-- 
              How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.-- Such 
              a happy little circle as you find us here.--Yes, indeed.-- Charming 
              young man!--that is--so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!-- 
              such attention to Jane!&quot;--And from her great, her more than 
              commonly thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma 
              guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards 
              Jane, from the vicarage quarter, which was now graciously overcome.-- 
              After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a guess, Mrs. 
              Elton, speaking louder, said, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, 
              that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, 
              the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master. He promised 
              to join me here, and pay his respects to you.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?-- 
              That will be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morning 
              visits, and Mr. Elton's time is so engaged.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from 
              morning to night.--There is no end of people's coming to him, on 
              some pretence or other.--The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, 
              are always wanting his opinion. They seem not able to do any thing 
              without him.--`Upon my word, Mr. E.,' I often say, `rather you than 
              I.-- I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument, 
              if I had half so many applicants.'--Bad enough as it is, for I absolutely 
              neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe I have not 
              played a bar this fortnight.--However, he is coming, I assure you: 
              yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all.&quot; And putting up 
              her hand to screen her words from Emma--&quot;A congratulatory visit, 
              you know.--Oh! yes, quite indispensable.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Miss Bates looked about her, so happily!-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself 
              from Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep 
              consultation.--Mr. E. is Knightley's right hand.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, &quot;Is 
              Mr. Elton gone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. 
              Weston and Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only 
              of those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing 
              their own way.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Have not you mistaken the day?&quot; said Emma. &quot;I am 
              almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr. 
              Knightley was at Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,&quot; was the abrupt 
              answer, which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's 
              side.-- &quot;I do believe,&quot; she continued, &quot;this is the 
              most troublesome parish that ever was. We never heard of such things 
              at Maple Grove.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Your parish there was small,&quot; said Jane. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the 
              subject talked of.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I 
              have heard you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and 
              Mrs. Bragge; the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty 
              children.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! you clever creature, that's very true. What a thinking 
              brain you have! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I 
              should make, if we could be shaken together. My liveliness and your 
              solidity would produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, 
              however, that some people may not think you perfection already.--But 
              hush!-- not a word, if you please.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her 
              words, not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly 
              saw. The wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, 
              was very evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Elton made his appearance. His lady greeted him with some of 
              her sparkling vivacity. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be 
              an encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!-- 
              But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew 
              I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.-- Here have 
              I been sitting this hour, giving these young ladies a sample of 
              true conjugal obedience--for who can say, you know, how soon it 
              may be wanted?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown 
              away. His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent 
              object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering, 
              and the walk he had had for nothing. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;When I got to Donwell,&quot; said he, &quot;Knightley could 
              not be found. Very odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent 
              him this morning, and the message he returned, that he should certainly 
              be at home till one.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Donwell!&quot; cried his wife.--&quot;My dear Mr. E., you 
              have not been to Donwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the 
              meeting at the Crown.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see 
              Knightley to-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling 
              morning!-- I went over the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great 
              ill-usage,)which made it so much the worse. And then not to find 
              him at home! I assure you I am not at all pleased. And no apology 
              left, no message for me. The housekeeper declared she knew nothing 
              of my being expected.-- Very extraordinary!--And nobody knew at 
              all which way he was gone. Perhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the 
              Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.-- Miss Woodhouse, this is not 
              like our friend Knightley!--Can you explain it?&quot; <br>
              <br>
              Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary, 
              indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I cannot imagine,&quot; said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity 
              as a wife ought to do,) &quot;I cannot imagine how he could do such 
              a thing by you, of all people in the world! The very last person 
              whom one should expect to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he must 
              have left a message for you, I am sure he must.--Not even Knightley 
              could be so very eccentric;-- and his servants forgot it. Depend 
              upon it, that was the case: and very likely to happen with the Donwell 
              servants, who are all, I have often observed, extremely awkward 
              and remiss.--I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry 
              stand at our sideboard for any consideration. And as for Mrs. Hodges, 
              Wright holds her very cheap indeed.--She promised Wright a receipt, 
              and never sent it.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I met William Larkins,&quot; continued Mr. Elton, &quot;as 
              I got near the house, and he told me I should not find his master 
              at home, but I did not believe him.--William seemed rather out of 
              humour. He did not know what was come to his master lately, he said, 
              but he could hardly ever get the speech of him. I have nothing to 
              do with William's wants, but it really is of very great importance 
              that I should see Knightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore, 
              of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk 
              to no purpose.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. In 
              all probability she was at this very time waited for there; and 
              Mr. Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression 
              towards Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined 
              to attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it 
              gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say, 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. 
              Had you not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been 
              tempted to introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more 
              openly than might have been strictly correct.--I feel that I should 
              certainly have been impertinent.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which 
              Emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance 
              of all her usual composure--&quot;there would have been no danger. 
              The danger would have been of my wearying you. You could not have 
              gratified me more than by expressing an interest--. Indeed, Miss 
              Woodhouse, (speaking more collectedly,) with the consciousness which 
              I have of misconduct, very great misconduct, it is particularly 
              consoling to me to know that those of my friends, whose good opinion 
              is most worth preserving, are not disgusted to such a degree as 
              to--I have not time for half that I could wish to say. I long to 
              make apologies, excuses, to urge something for myself. I feel it 
              so very due. But, unfortunately--in short, if your compassion does 
              not stand my friend--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,&quot; cried Emma 
              warmly, and taking her hand. &quot;You owe me no apologies; and 
              every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly 
              satisfied, so delighted even--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.-- 
              So cold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life 
              of deceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be 
              on my side. Let us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever 
              is to be done quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time 
              there. I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose 
              you-- just as I begin to know you.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. 
              I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,&quot; replied 
              Emma, smiling--&quot;but, excuse me, it must be thought of.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>The smile was returned as Jane answered, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own 
              to you, (I am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with 
              Mr. Churchill at Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, 
              at least, of deep mourning; but when they are over, I imagine there 
              will be nothing more to wait for.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you, thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured 
              of.-- Oh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided 
              and open!-- Good-bye, good-bye.&quot; </p>

              FADE IN</p>
            <p> The screen is a microcosm of leaf, crystal drops of precipitation, 
              a stone, emerald green moss. It's a landscape in miniature. We HEAR 
              the forest. Some distant birds. Their sound seems to reverberate 
              as if in a cavern. A piece of sunlight refracts within the drops 
              of water, paints a patch of moss yellow. The whisper of wind is 
              joined by another sound that mixes with it. A distant rustling. 
              It gets closer and louder. It's shallow breathing. It gets ominous. 
              We're interlopers on the floor of the forest and something is coming. 
            </p>
            <p> SUDDENLY: A MOCCASINED FOOT<br>
              <br>
              rockets through the frame scaring us and ... </p>
            <p> EXTREMELY CLOSE: PART OF AN INDIAN FACE<br>
              running hard. His head shaved bald except for a scalp-lock. Tattoos. 
              He's twenty-five. He seems tall and muscled. Heavy, even breathing. 
              We'll learn later this man is UNCAS, the last of the Mohicans. </p>
            <p> PROFILE: UNCAS' ARMS</p>
            <p> flash as he runs. One carries a flintlock musket. Sweat on the 
              man's skin. A calico shirt is gathered at the waist with a wampum 
              belt of small white beads over a breechcloth. He wears leggings 
              to protect his legs. A long-handled tomahawk is stuffed in his belt.

              <br>
              CHEST</p>
            <p> A green bear claw is tattooed there. Silver armband. A snake is 
              tattooed over his left eyebrow. Silver rings in his ear. He's forty 
              to forty-five. His head is shaved into a scalp-lock. It says: &quot;Come 
              and lift this from me. Take it, if you can ...&quot; That prospect 
              strikes us as extremely unlikely. This man is CHINGACHGOOK.</p>
            <p> The French call him &quot;Le Gros Serpent,&quot; the Great Snake, 
              because <br>
              &quot;he knows the winding ways of men's nature and he can strike 
              a sudden, deathly blow.&quot; </p>
            <p> WIDE ANGLE: CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> runs, disturbing no leaves, no branches; making no sound. He's 
              running parallel to Uncas through the cathedral of mature forest. 
              It's heavily canopied. There's very little brush. The girth of the 
              trees is huge. Shafts of light illuminate motes of dust and turn 
              leaves emerald where the sun breaks through. Sometimes there's ferns; 
              rhododendron, sometimes pale grass and outcroppings of rock. <br>
              These men run the forest streams, over boulders, fallen trees and 
              down into ravines as if they own them. They do. </p>

            <p> ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - LONG BLACK HAIR - DAY</p>
            <p> rocketing through trees. His torn buckskin shirt is tied at the 
              waist with a wampum belt holding a tomahawk and a large knife. A 
              long rifle in which is carved the name &quot;Killdeer&quot; is in 
              his right fist. Indian tattooing on his chest. <br>
              His name is NATHANIEL POE. He's a few years older than Uncas. The 
              French and the French-speaking tribes know him as La Longue Carabine 
              (Long Rifle). Other frontiersmen in New York colony and the Iroquois 
              and Delaware-speaking tribes know him as Hawkeye. Sweat stains his 
              shirt. He flashes through the tree branches disturbing nothing. 
              Making no sound. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S POV: A PIECE OF TAN</p>
            <p> two hundred and fifty yards away, a few square inches buried in 
              the foliage ... </p>
            <p> SUDDENLY HE STOPS</p>

            <p> stops dead, holding out his hand ... no sound. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> slips through young trees and stops, shouldering his smoothbore 
              musket. Is this an ambush? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S POV: RACK FOCUS THROUGH THE GUN SIGHT</p>
            <p> Five feet and fourteen pounds of rifle is elevated a half inch 
              and shifted left, off target. It's a precise, smooth movement. No 
              human quiver. </p>

            <p> tighter ... </p>
            <p> THE COCK</p>
            <p> holding the flint hits the iron file of the frizzen, shooting 
              sparks into the pan of priming powder which flashes and ... </p>
            <p> TAN<br>
              is a huge elk that leaps at the sound. </p>
            <p> KILLDEER'S MUZZLE</p>
            <p> CRACKS like lightning. </p>
            <p> AN ELK</p>
            <p> leaps where the .59 caliber round was programmed to intercept 
              him. On the moment of impact ... </p>
            <p> WIDE</p>
            <p> three men approach the fallen elk and each other. We realize they're 
              hunting together. Hawkeye steps aside for Chingachgook. His massive 
              war club is flat and angles to one side with a stabbing blade. Hawkeye 
              is stepson and stepbrother. The two younger men treat Chingachgook 
              with an easy deference and affection. <br>
              Hawkeye's a dialectic of two cultures. In his coloration and worldliness 
              he's more the Anglo-Saxon frontiersman. In his independent views 
              and candid manner and in his combat skills and woodsmanship, he's 
              more native American (Mohican). <br>
              As Chingachgook takes out his long knife and they approach the fallen 
              elk ...] <br>

              We're sorry to kill you, Brother. <br>
              Forgive us. I do honor to your courage and <br>

            <p> roasts potatoes on a stick in the stone fireplace next to CAPTAIN 
              JACK WINTHROP, an American in very worn quasi-military gear. On 
              a rough table in the tiny cabin ALEXANDRIA, his wife, is kneading 
              bread. Three children climb on their father. He grabs their wild 
              seven year old son, JAMES, who shrieks laughter and dodges <br>
              away. The cabin has two primitive rooms, waxed paper windows, log 
              walls. O.S. a dog barks. Others pick it up. Cameron &amp; Jack are 
              suddenly alert, reaching for weapons ... </p>

              Halloo! John Cameron! </p>

              How is Chingachgook, then? </p>
            <p> Behind him, emerging from the dark trees are Hawkeye, Uncas, cradling 
              flint locks, blankets and packs over their shoulders, leading a 
              mule laden with skins and the elk carcass. Crossing the splitrail 
              fence ... </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK<br>
              The Master of Life is good. Another year pass ... <br>
              How is it with you, John? </p>
            <p> CAMERON<br>
              Gettin' along. Yes, it is. <br>

              Nathaniel. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Hello John. Cleared another quarter, I see. </p>
            <p> CAMERON<br>
              (shakes hands with Uncas)<br>
              Yes, I did. </p>
            <p> JAMES CAMERON</p>
            <p> tears past his father &amp; runs full bore. Just before he's going 
              to collide into Uncas, he leaps into the air and Uncas snatches 
              him with one hand and swings him up onto his shoulders. The kid 
              screams with delight and rides back towards the cabin that way. 
              Alexandria comes to the door. </p>

            <p> INTERIOR CABIN - CHINGACHGOOK - EVENING (LATER)</p>
            <p> lights &amp; smokes a clay pipe. The scene says: this is a rustic, 
              frontier home and these people have known each other &amp; live 
              in dangerous circumstances. </p>
            <p> ALEXANDRIA<br>
              If Uncas is with you, that means he has not <br>
              found a woman and started a family yet. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK<br>
              Your eyes are too sharp, Alexandria Cameron. <br>
              They see into my heart. </p>
            <p> UNCAS<br>
              Your farm good to you this year, John? </p>
            <p> CAMERON<br>
              It was a good year for corn. </p>
            <p> UNCAS<br>
              Mohawk field we saw was 5 mile long on the river. Chief Joseph Brandt's 
              field. </p>
            <p> CAMERON<br>
              You take much fur? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              That we did. John. But the horicane <br>
              (sic)<br>
              is near trapped out. </p>
            <p> JACK<br>
              Tradin' your skins in Castleton? </p>
            <p> UNCAS<br>
              No, Schylerville. With the Dutch for silver. French &amp; English 
              want to buy with wampum &amp; brandy. </p>
            <p> Pause, then ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here? </p>
            <p> JACK<br>
              A French &amp; Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south 
              to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia 
              to aid the <br>
              British defense. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Folks here goin' to join in that fight? </p>
            <p> JACK<br>
              We'll see in the morning ... </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK<br>
              Fathers of England &amp; France, both, take more land, furs, than 
              they need. They're cold &amp; full of greed ... </p>
            <p> JACK<br>
              Few'd deny that? Where you headin'? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Trap over the fall and winter among the Delawares in Can-tuck-ee. 
            </p>
            <p> UNCAS<br>
              So I can find a woman and make Mohican <br>
              children so our father will leave my brother <br>
              &amp; me in peace. </p>
            <p> Alexandria laughs. So do Hawkeye &amp; Chingachgook. </p>
            <p> JAMES<br>
              A son like me? </p>
            <p> Uncas grabs James &amp; suspends him upside down.</p>
            <p> UNCAS<br>
              No. You are too strong. Turn me old <br>
              too fast! </p>
            <p> Hawkeye grabs the kid from Uncas. The kid's laughing &amp; can't 
              stay still. Chingachgook watches, content, smoking his clay pipe.</p>
            <p> ALEXANDRIA<br>
              That's what he's doin' to his mama ... </p>
            <p> She ruffles his hair and lifts the heavy iron pot off the tibbet. 
              Uncas goes to help her, she shrugs his hand away and carries it 
              to the table herself. The men gather around. There's pan-baked bread, 
              a dish of salt, and the pot has venison and yellow cornmeal in a 
              kind of stew. Everyone waits.</p>
            <p> CAMERON<br>
              Dear Father, thank you for rewardin' the fruits<br>
              of our labor with plenty. Amen. </p>

            <p>EXTERIOR CAMERON CABIN - MOHAWK BOY &amp; JAMES CAMERON - MORNING</p>
            <p> slam into other kids as they battle through a Lacrosse game. In 
              the background are sixty men, women and children. It's a community 
              gathering held out of doors. We've entered mid-scene. Captain Jack 
              is standing on a box. Some women and kids mill around some tables 
              and boards laid over barrels. Cooking fires. Smoke. <br>
              Most but not all around Captain Jack are men, nine settlers, 3 hunter/trappers, 
              eight Mohawk farmers in mixed European and native clothing. Off 
              to the side are an English Lieutenant on horseback and a ten-man 
              escort from whatever regiment's in Albany. A man named HENRI speaks 
              in French. His son, MARTIN, translates. </p>
            <p> HENRI<br>
              (O.S. in French)</p>
            <p> MARTIN<br>
              (translates) <br>
              My father says he was driven out of France by <br>
              the black robe priests and he would fight them <br>
              now but he lost his arm and so I will go in his <br>
              place. </p>
            <p> Meanwhile ... </p>
            <p> ONGEWASGONE</p>
            <p> is an unusually large Mohawk in a blue match coat with a little 
              girl holding his hand. He says something to Chingachgook who nods. 
              Hawkeye and Uncas are a little apart in an outer grouping of the 
              men. Ongewasgone is a war chief and wears a white plume and is tattooed. 
              As Martin finishes, he steps forward. </p>
            <p> ONGEWASGONE<br>
              John Cameron, thank you for your hospitality ... <br>
              Twin River Mohawk got no quarrel with Les <br>
              Francais. Trade furs with Les Francais. Now Les <br>
              Francais bring Huron onto Mohawk hunting grounds ... </p>
            <p> These people are English, Scots-Irish and Dutch farmers; some 
              French Huguenot &quot;mechanics&quot; (craftsmen). They're in shirt-sleeves 
              and Indian moccasins &amp; leggings. The Mohawks' vast lands and 
              corn agriculture border the settlement. They 've been acculturated 
              for over a hundred years. Some wear European calico hunting shirts.<br>
              Their heads are shaved to scalping locks and many are tattooed. 
              They've politically and commercially played France &amp; England 
              against each other very adroitly for over a hundred years because 
              of their military power and geographic position. Their relations<br>
              with working farmers and settlers and their families has been mostly 
              one of co-existence because there's always been more than enough 
              for all. This is a WPA mural of ethnic diversity and plurality of 
              frontier America. The Europeans are former indentured laborers,

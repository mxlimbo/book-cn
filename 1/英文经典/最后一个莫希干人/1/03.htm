              EXTERIOR POLTROON'S HOUSE - DUNCAN HEYWARD - DAY</p>
            <p> brushed clean, his wig freshly powdered, his tricorn in his hand 
              with a crimson sash and sword and his cavalry boots, walks through 
              the gate after knocking. He enters a small courtyard. Suddenly he 
              hears ... </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              (O.S.)<br>
              Heyward! Duncan Heyward. </p>
            <p> Heyward looks to the side. An inner light turns on. In this mode, 
              this is a man we could like. </p>
            <p> REVERSE: CORA MUNRO</p>
            <p> enters from the garden. She's vivacious, dark-haired, unconventional 
              in that she's educated, but with conventional values and attitudes. 
              She hugs Duncan to her and then pushes him away to look at him.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              My God it's good to see you. </p>
            <p> He takes her hand in both of his and kisses it. He is open and 
              lit up. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR POLTROON'S HOUSE, BACK YARD - CORA &amp; HEYWARD - DAY</p>
            <p> A vegetable plot behind the Poltroon's house is a provincial substitute 
              for a formal garden setting. Heyward and Cora sit on rough wooden 
              chairs. Wind blows. In the background a servant hangs laundry. The 
              white sheets billow. A table holds a tea setting. They're sitting 
              close to each other, talking seriously and quietly. Duncan's jacket 
              is removed. Time's passed. Long pause. Then:</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive ... after so long apart and 
              after you've traveled so far ... </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              And by sea! </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              You still have an aversion to the water? </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Aversion? No. ... &quot;Hatred&quot; ... &quot;Loathing&quot; ... 
            </p>
            <p> Cora laughs.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              But it was worth it all to end in a garden by your side.</p>
            <p> She looks askance at him. Then the banter drops.</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              (difficult)<br>
              Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice 
              and I depend on you and respect you immensely ... I wish they did, 
              but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see? </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman 
              to be joined? And all else may grow in time ...? </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Some say that's the way of it. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              &quot;Some&quot;? </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Cousin Eugenie, my father, but ... </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (interrupts)<br>
              Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest 
              couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help <br>
              settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not 
              rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine? </p>
            <p> Cora stares directly at Heyward. Then she looks away. She has 
              no answer. Something subterranean disturbs her about delegating 
              judgment over the fate of her life.</p>
            <p><br>
              HEYWARD<br>
              Will you consider that? </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              (pause; smiles)<br>
              Yes. Yes, I will. </p>
            <p> She's still unsettled.</p>
            <p> ALICE<br>
              (O.S.)<br>
              Duncan! </p>
            <p> REVERSE: ALICE MUNRO</p>
            <p> eighteen years old, white-blonde hair, wide blue eyes. She's effervescent 
              and runs to hug him. Heyward is taken aback by her enthusiasm and 
              laughs.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              My God, you've grown up. </p>
            <p> ALICE<br>
              We leave in the morning?! </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (rises)<br>
              Yes, miss. </p>
            <p> ALICE<br>
              I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure! I absolutely cannot wait 
              to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, 
              <br>
              red men in the wild! </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              My God, Alice. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (smiles)<br>
              It can be dangerous ... </p>
            <p> ALICE<br>
              Nonsense. Papa wouldn't have sent for us if it were dangerous. </p>
            <p> Alice takes Hewyward's hand. Cora pours Heyward more tea. The 
              white sheets billow. </p>
            <p> AMBROSE<br>
              (O.S. - barks)<br>
              Atten-shun! </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR BRITISH ARMY HQ - TWENTY BRITISH REGULARS - DAY</p>
            <p> jolt upright as if electrified.</p>
            <p> AMBROSE<br>
              (entering) <br>
              Shoulder arms! </p>
            <p> AMBROSE</p>
            <p> a sergeant major of forty-one is wide and deep and built like 
              a fullback. You do not mess with Sgt. Major Ambrose.</p>
            <p> AMBROSE<br>
              (barks) <br>
              Form two companies of nine ... MARCH!! </p>
            <p> THE MEN</p>
            <p> march in perfect drill into two groups, each three across and 
              three deep. </p>
            <p> MILITARY HQ, ENTRANCE - MAJOR DUNCAN HEYWARD</p>
            <p> steps out. Rigid salutes. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> climbs onto his white military charger. It's spirited. Cora &amp; 
              Alice are in riding dresses and veils. The veil doesn't completely 
              cover Alice's golden hair and blue eyes and the flush of her complexion. 
              They're riding two sidesaddled Narragansetts. The tight traveling 
              dress reveals that Cora, two or three years older than Alice, is 
              fuller and more<br>
              mature. All three ride to the front of the column. The baggage horses 
              and mule are in the gap between the two companies. </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> cradling his musket. </p>
            <p> REAR SHOT: THE COLUMN</p>
            <p> down the path that leads into the wall of forest looks impressive. 
            </p>
            <p> WIDER: THE COLUMN</p>
            <p> marching. Now they look brave but smaller. The forest - with all 
              its mysteries and dangers - now impresses us as a towering dark, 
              sinister, and it's immensity swallows up the living mass which slowly 
              enters its bosom.</p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> INTERIOR FOREST</p>
            <p> TRACKING the Redcoats, their faces now filmed with dust, cut with 
              lines of perspiration. They march in perfect formation. </p>
            <p> We TRACK PAST the pack horses, the first company, Sgt. Major Ambrose 
              and on to Cora &amp; Alice. Alice seems fatigued. Cora's turned, 
              looking up into the forest canopy, astonished at the deep beauty 
              of the place. </p>
            <p> CORA'S POV: FOREST CANOPY</p>
            <p> of trees is dark, except for spots where leaves are sparse, and 
              there the light is golden. It's the forest of childhood. </p>
            <p> In a ravine a buck disappears into a deeper stand of trees.</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              (O.S.)<br>
              Alice, did you see that ...? </p>
            <p> CORA'S</p>
            <p> reverie's broken by Heyward entering the frame. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Alice? </p>
            <p> Alice rouses from fatigue.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Are you alright? </p>
            <p> ALICE<br>
              Can we rest soon? </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Absolutely. </p>
            <p> Heyward rides to the front of the column to Magua, who's twenty 
              to thirty yards ahead of everybody else.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              You there, Scout! </p>
            <p> Magua slowly turns towards Heyward.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (overly articulated) <br>
              We must ... stop ... soon. Women are ... tired. <br>
              You ... understand? </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              (perfect English)<br>
              I understand. This is not good place to stop. Two leagues from here. 
              No water 'til then. That where we stop. Better place. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we 
              will proceed. Do you understand? </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              (in Huron: English subtitle)<br>
              &quot;Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women. When his 
              women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Excuse me. What did you say? </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              Magua say: &quot;Yes. Good idea.&quot; </p>
            <p> As they begin to stop ... </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR MOUNTAINS &amp; FOREST - WIDE - DAY</p>
            <p> Silently entering on either side of us come Chingachgook, followed 
              by Hawkeye and Uncas. Even relaxed, they carry themselves with a 
              degree of alertness. They're eighteenth century Viet Cong moving 
              through the rain forest. The Maxfield Parrish/Hudson Valley of tall 
              trees, ravines and streams is idyllic in front of them. All three 
              cradle their long guns and move silently on moccasined feet. </p>
            <p> FRONTAL: CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> - in a stream - relaxed but attentive, abruptly stops. The others 
              freeze in their tracks. Chingachgook sees and then stoops to examine 
              ... </p>
            <p> ROCK</p>
            <p> under the water in the stream. It's been turned from its bed. 
              Chingachgook finds another. Uncas, moving up on his flank, climbs 
              the bank and moves off into the trees, searches and then he gestures 
              ... he's found another sign of something. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> has headed off further down the stream and discovers nothing. 
              Rapidly he rejoins Uncas and Hawkeye who've become extremely alert. 
              They move up the bank into the forest ninety degrees from their 
              previous path. </p>
            <p> TRACKING: HAWKEYE, UNCAS &amp; CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> moving. Fast. Nearly soundless. They hardly disturb a blade of 
              grass. The impression:<br>
              expertise, deadliness and an impression something's wrong. </p>

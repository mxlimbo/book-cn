              EXTERIOR RIVER - WHITE WATER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> miles from the falls. We see a figure. It's Chingachgook, nearly 
              spent, rolling and tumbling through the fast-moving white water. 
              He submerges, then surfaces again. He appears exhausted by the fall 
              and ride. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK'S POV: WATER</p>
            <p> rocketing at us, battering and drowning us. We glimpse something 
              downstream ... </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> tries to focus, slammed against rocks, he's striking out towards 
              the right, swimming against the current. He's grabbing for something. 
            </p>
            <p> KILLDEER'S MUZZLE</p>
            <p> and leather shoulder-strap. Chingachgook's hand grabs it. The 
              current rushing past tries to steal him from Uncas and Hawkeye, 
              who're also beaten, bloodied, exhausted. They pull the older, larger 
              man from the water and ... </p>
            <p> ON THE ROCK</p>
            <p> all three lie there, almost devoid of energy. Then Hawkeye rises, 
              looks at the others. Chingachgook nods. He's up. Then Uncas, and 
              they're moving off into the calm eddy between the rock they landed 
              on and the shoreline. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FOREST - HURONS - DAY</p>
            <p> move along animal paths. </p>
            <p> CORA &amp; ALICE</p>
            <p> struggle through the branches of trees. No one helps them. When 
              they fall behind, they are pushed forward. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> badly beaten, bound, staggers ahead to get behind Maqua. Then:</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers ... will receive many gifts. 
            </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              (as if considering)<br>
              Gifts? </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Three, four oxen ... much wampum. </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              Wampum? </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Yes. </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              Does Yengeese Major have property <br>
              across salt sea? </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Yes. </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              Yengeese Major give all property to Magua. Magua give Yengeese Major 
              much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen. </p>
            <p> Magua looks at Heyward derisively. Does this white man think he's 
              an idiot?</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Gold could be arranged. </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              For Munro children? </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Yes. </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              How much gold has the master of the Yengeese? </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              The King? The King has mountains of gold! </p>
            <p> Long pause as if Magua and King George II were seriously considering 
              this transaction.</p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              Not enough. </p>
            <p> Heyward is first realizing with whom he's playing.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              What is enough? </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              Heart. Give Magua new heart. </p>
            <p> Magua totally disdains the Englishman and walks away from him, 
              starting up a steeper forested hill. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FOREST - HAWKEYE, UNCAS &amp; CHINGACHGOOK - TWILIGHT</p>
            <p> running cross-country after the Huron column. They leap over fallen 
              logs and keep going. </p>
            <p> FRONTAL: HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> breathing hard, his lips are drawn back, sweat stains his buckskins. 
            </p>
            <p> PROFILE: UNCAS</p>
            <p> runs. Then sees something. </p>
            <p> BENT BRANCH</p>
            <p> where Cora &amp; Alice were struggling up the animal path. </p>
            <p> REAR SHOT</p>
            <p> as they race across a stream away from us after the war party 
              and into the night ... </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FOREST - CORA - NIGHT</p>
            <p> supporting Alice, is dragged forward by a Huron warrior by a woven 
              rawhide thong tied to her neck. </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> is imperturbable. </p>
            <p> HURONS</p>
            <p> move quickly down into a ravine. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> is shoved forward. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FOREST - RUNNING FEET - DAY</p>
            <p> Long, loping strides. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE &amp; UNCAS</p>
            <p> cover ground like long-distance runners. No noise except their 
              hard, even breathing. They're moving down a clear trail. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> out on the flank. Running hard. </p>
            <p> CLOSER: HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> lips are drawn back, determined, flashing through the hard verticals 
              of the forest, now leaps down an embankment into the soft loam and 
              keeps going. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXT. HURON VILLAGE - ORNATE CHAIR - DAY</p>
            <p> on a rude platform. The entire village is crowded in a large circle. 
              They all wait for someone. They've been waiting a long time. In 
              the perimeter warriors keep Huron at bay for some reason. We see 
              Magua. He stands apart. They wait. Then ... </p>
            <p> ANCIENT SACHEM</p>
            <p> is led to the dais by three women down the main street between 
              the neat rows of birch bark lodges. Many scalps and trophies from 
              the massacre are in evidence. He sits on the raised platform. He 
              looks to be in his nineties. His dark wrinkled face is contrasted 
              by his long white hair. His robe is painted in hieroglyphical representation 
              of combat. He wears numerous silver &amp; gold medals, gifts of 
              French, English and Dutch governors. Most startling is his face. 
              His dark &amp; lined skin is enhanced by delicate lines of tatooing. 
              He looks up to Magua. </p>
            <p> SACHEM<br>
              (in Huron; subtitled)<br>
              The tomahawks of your young men have been very red. </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              (in Huron; subtitled)<br>
              Many of the Yengeese are dead, great Sachem. <br>
              (sound dissolve to English)<br>
              I have brought three of my prisoners, to honor you. Two are the 
              children of Munro. Whose scalp hangs on my lodge pole. And whose 
              heart I cut from his chest. </p>
            <p> Now we see Cora on the ground. Defeat &amp; fear are held in place 
              by her determination. Alice looks around, in another place. Heyward's 
              hands are bound between his back with a piece of wood wedged through 
              his elbows. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR DIFFERENT FOREST - WIDE FRONTAL: UNCAS, HAWKEYE &amp; 
              CHINGACHGOOK - DAY</p>
            <p> running. Then Uncas drops and the other two follow. </p>
            <p> WIDE OVER THEIR SHOULDERS: THE HURON &quot;CASTLE&quot;</p>
            <p> seen in the distance through the sparse trees. They have dropped 
              at the very periphery of the forest where the woods end. (The lay 
              of the land is important for action that follows: the village is 
              built in a meadow. To the left is a cliff face that rises to a rocky 
              promontory. On the right is a path that winds up to the promontory 
              and beyond, across the mountains.)<br>
              Hawkeye sees ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S POV: THE VILLAGE, CAPTIVES &amp; HURON CROWD</p>
            <p> in the center, outside the largest lodge. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> slams the earth with his fists. They didn't intercept them in 
              time. Difficult odds just became impossible. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR HURON VILLAGE - MAGUA - DAY</p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              ... the earth was pale. Our tomahawks were bright. Now they are 
              dull from war. And the Huron rich with the trophies of honor ... 
              Magua will sell the English officer to Les Francais and the reward 
              is <br>
              my gift to you, wise one ... The women - children of the white war 
              chief - will burn in our fires so all can share in this. </p>
            <p> The sachem considers this. Then he looks up and sees something 
              beyond Magua. </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> senses the sachem's eye line ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> unarmed, walking through the Hurons. A young boy rushes at him. 
              Hawkeye, at the last possible second, dodges. Others catch and restrain 
              the boy. The Hurons are astounded a European would simply walk into 
              their camp. </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> sees him enter, doesn't believe he's there. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Nathaniel! </p>
            <p> Hawkeye glances at her, doesn't respond. The situation is a stick 
              of dynamite ready to go off.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (to Heyward; low)<br>
              Translate for me, Major. Into French. <br>
              Every word ... as I say it. </p>
            <p> Magua starts towards Hawkeye, his tomahawk slipping into his hand.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (to Sachem)<br>
              I come to you unarmed and in peace to unstop your ears, wise one. 
              Because the Hurons are mislead by the words of the wolf who's never 
              spoken the truth.</p>
            <p> Sachem gestures with his hand to Magua. Magua reluctantly stops 
              advancing on Hawkeye. Heyward's French translation has faded to 
              a murmur. We hear Hawkeye's English.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the 
              fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless 
              ones. </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              (to Sachem)<br>
              Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of 
              war. The Huron do not fear English anger. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (to Sachem)<br>
              Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor 
              not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that <br>
              the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron. </p>
            <p> Sachem reacts.</p>

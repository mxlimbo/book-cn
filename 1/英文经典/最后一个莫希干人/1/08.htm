              HEYWARD<br>
              Things were done. Nobody was spared ... </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              Terrible feature of war in the Americas. <br>
              (beat; a mantra)<br>
              Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty. Our duty is to defeat 
              France. That hangs on a courier to Webb. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> INTERIOR MONTCALM'S MARQUEE - CHORAL GROUP - NIGHT</p>
            <p> of three Seneca women and five boys, led by a Jesuit, sing the 
              Te Deum in the Iroquois language. This is a large tent that could 
              sleep twenty. Montcalm's four personal guards are at the entrance 
              as well as COMTE DE LEVIS in dirty lace, a facial wound and a braceful 
              of pistols on a sash. Inside is simple campaign furniture and a 
              six by eight foot battle standard and flag of France. </p>
            <p> MONTCALM</p>
            <p> stands with a huge and fearsome elaborately tattooed and robed 
              Seneca chief in a silk turban ...</p>
            <p> SENECA CHIEF<br>
              (low)<br>
              ... and the Black Robes of Michilimackinac left us no time to put 
              our cabins in order before telling us our French father had need 
              of our aid. We rolled our blankets and were the first to be here. 
              Yet we <br>
              are not the first and closest to my father's campfire. The Marquis 
              de Montcalm is forty-five, wears a large wampum belt as a sash over 
              his<br>
              waistcoat. He has an acute intellect, an elegant manner. He is more 
              aristocratic than Munro, but a consummate professional soldier. 
              Over the Seneca's shoulder, Montcalm sees and nods to ... </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> entering with four Huron braves. This is not the Magua we saw 
              on the trail. In his scalp lock, now red-stained and cut to a Huron 
              roach, are three blacl plumes. A match-coat blanket drapes his left 
              shoulder. </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              (to Seneca Chief)<br>
              For my children and the children of the true faith, my friendship 
              and esteem is boundless ... I will give you three oxen for a feast 
              and tomorrow I, myself, will sing the war song with you in the <br>
              great council house. </p>
            <p> The Seneca Chief is satisfied and his people, plus the Jesuit, 
              exit. The look on Magua's face and the wry expression on Montcalm's 
              allows us to understand their relationship is based on realpolitik.</p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              Le Renard Subtil, how are things with your English friends? </p>
            <p> Magua exhales in derision as he brings a chair to face Montcalm 
              and sits, European style ...</p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              (over his shoulder)<br>
              Louis Antoine, join us. </p>
            <p> LOUIS ANTOINE DE BOUGAINVILLE enters. He wears a functional melange 
              of Indian moccasins over white linen breeches and an officer's waistcoat. 
            </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              Hear what le Subtil has to tell us ... </p>
            <p> Bougainville published a book on integral calculus at twenty-five, 
              at twenty-six was a secretary to the French Ambassador in London, 
              in January 1756 at twenty-seven he was elected a member of the British 
              Royal Academy of Science and at age twenty-eight he's aide de camp 
              to the Marquis de Montcalm with the rank of captain. Later in life, 
              he<br>
              brought &quot;bougainvillea&quot; from Tahiti to Europe to America.</p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              English war chief, Webb goes to Fort Edward with 33rd Regiment. 
              He does not know my father's army attacks Fort William Henry. </p>
            <p> BOUGAINVILLE<br>
              But by now Munro knows his couriers didn't get through. He'll send 
              another. </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              The Grey Hair will try. </p>
            <p> BOUGAINVILLE<br>
              Four or five, including two women entered the fort ... </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              The Grey Hair's children were under Magua's knife but escaped. They'll 
              be under it again. </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua? </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he 
              dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair 
              will <br>
              see his seed is wiped out forever. </p>
            <p> Montcalm won't get a direct answer.</p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              My sappeurs are advancing the trenches through the night, now. You 
              may have your opportunity soon. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> INTERIOR SURGERY, ENTRANCE - PHELPS - NIGHT</p>
            <p> exhausted, sitting on a low stool, taking a breath.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE (O.S.)<br>
              She know what she's doin'? </p>
            <p> Phelps looks up, then he looks over his shoulder at Cora. She's 
              in a borrowed launderess dress/blouse ... She looks different. He's 
              a little indignant.</p>
            <p> PHELPS<br>
              First assisted me in Austria when she was <br>
              fourteen. I would say she does ... </p>
            <p> Her apron is stained. Hawkeye sees this may be her first time 
              in the New World, but it's not her first military campaign. Still 
              angered at Munro's dismissive response, he's nevertheless falling 
              for Cora.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              She does not shy away from much ... </p>
            <p> PHELPS<br>
              (elsewhere) <br>
              What's that? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Nothin'. </p>
            <p> Alice Munro has caught Hawkeye's attention. Outside the surgery 
              where a casement meets a wall, she sits, withdrawn. A catatonic 
              older woman in a fine dress sits next to her.</p>
            <p> PHELPS (O.S.)<br>
              Miss Cora? Gentleman looking for you. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> enters. Cora's sewing up Uncas.</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              (looks up) <br>
              Mr Poe? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Miss. <br>
              (re: cotton) <br>
              May I? </p>
            <p> Cora, curious, nods. Hawkeye cuts some pieces from her ruined 
              and discarded dress that she now uses to bandage Uncas. We don't 
              know why; neither does Cora.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (to Uncas) <br>
              You 'bout done holdin' hands with Miss Munro? </p>
            <p> Uncas laughs, looking from her to Hawkeye. Then he's up and he 
              hurts. Cora starts to tend another wounded man. As they start out, 
              Hawkeye hesitates. Sensing it, Cora turns.</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              What are you looking at, Mr. Poe? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Why, I am looking at you, Miss. </p>
            <p> Cora measures the directness of Hawkeye's manner. It's not insolent, 
              only unsettling. Feeling foolish; she turns. He leaves. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FRENCH TRENCHES - SAPPEURS &amp; ENGINEERS - NIGHT</p>
            <p> having worked through the night, are still digging the diagonally-advancing 
              trench. We note it's closer than it was. </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FRENCH TRENCHES - FRENCH PICKETTS</p>
            <p> at their posts guard the sappeurs. Meanwhile ... </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY, WEST SIDE - SALLY-PORT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> opens. Ten Mohawks and Rangers crawl towards the French lines. 
              Meanwhile ... </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY, PARAPET - HAWKEYE &amp; UNCAS -<br>
              NIGHT</p>
            <p> are low and out of French sight in the northeast battery. Four 
              others are with them, including Captain Jack. Stacked rifles are 
              against the casement. We don't know why. Each rifle is within reach 
              of Hawkeye's hand. Hawkeye is taking extra care loading Killdeer. 
              He charges it once, then overloads the powder by a quarter charge.</p>
            <p> UNCAS<br>
              You told him about the raid? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (nods) <br>
              He does not want to hear it. <br>
              (pause) <br>
              But he is gonna have to. </p>
            <p> JACK<br>
              (to one man) <br>
              Get together by the West Battery James &amp; Ian, <br>
              Sharitarish &amp; William. </p>
            <p> Hawkeye uses the fine cotton he took from Cora. Uncas sees it.</p>
            <p> UNCAS<br>
              Tight weave. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Another forty yards? </p>
            <p><br>
              Uncas nods. Hawkeye wets it to make a tighter gas seal and rams 
              it home. The tighter fit requires more effort. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> looks below to ground level ... </p>
            <p> A FRONTIERSMAN - COURIER</p>
            <p> Two pistols are holstered in a sash around his chest. He wears 
              no hat and carries no pack. He waits by the sally-port door. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FRENCH TRENCH - THREE PICKETS - NIGHT</p>
            <p> are suddenly tomahawked and knifed by stripped down 42nd Highlanders 
              and Mohawks. Alarm is raised. French and some Huron run to advance. 
              Shots are fired.<br>
              The Rangers &amp; Mohawks fall back. </p>
            <p> FRENCH</p>
            <p> emboldened, pursue ... </p>
            <p> TRENCH IN FRONT OF WEST WALL</p>
            <p> suddenly Heyward and three companies of the 62nd regiment of Foot 
              (60 men) are over the top in perfect formation ...</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Sergeant! Form three ranks! </p>
            <p> SERGEANT MAJOR<br>

              March! <br>
              (three motions; drums) <br>
              Rear ranks, proper distance! <br>
              (the rear ranks back up six paces)<br>
              Front ranks, take your distance! March! <br>
              (everybody moves)<br>
              Halt! <br>
              (in unison they slam to a stop)<br>
              Make ready! <br>
              (muskets snap to port arms) </p>
            <p> MOHAWKS &amp; HIGHLANDERS</p>
            <p> dodge right &amp; left of the 62nd's line of fire. </p>
            <p> FRENCH</p>
            <p> are coming forward. Their sergeants trying to stop and form their 
              men in ad-libbed French. </p>
            <p> 62ND REGIMENT OF FOOT</p>
            <p> SERGEANT MAJOR<br>
              (dead cool)<br>
              First rank! Second rank! Present arms! <br>

            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Fire!!! </p>
            <p> Like one shot, lightening, smoke and .65 caliber death screams 
              from the first two ranks like a scythe, cutting down ... </p>
            <p> REVERSE: FRENCH</p>
            <p> Fourteen wounded or killed ... </p>
            <p> 62ND REGIMENT OF FOOT - HEYWARD</p>
            <p> exposed. He's oblivious to incoming rounds. A piece of hat is 
              blown off, epaulet is shot off. The man next to him is killed and 
              bloodies Heyward's coat. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Advance, Sergeant Major! </p>
            <p> SERGEANT MAJOR<br>
              Sir!!! <br>
              (to soldiers)<br>
              Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!</p>
            <p> Drums. The rear rank walks through the first two ranks, who are 
              priming and loading in perfect order to their Sergeant Major's commands. 
              As the third rank becomes the first rank ...</p>
            <p> SERGEANT MAJOR<br>
              Shoulder arms! <br>

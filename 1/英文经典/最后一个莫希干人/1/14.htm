            <p> HAWKEYE CANOE</p>
            <p> sprints forward. </p>
            <p> CLOSE: HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> looks over his shoulder. </p>
            <p> THE HURON CANOES</p>
            <p> They're pulling away from them.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Pull ...! </p>
            <p> More Huron musket balls hit water nearby. </p>
            <p> REDCOAT</p>
            <p> in Heyward's boat is shot. BUT ... the .65 caliber ball didn't 
              penetrate his skin. The Redcoat - amazed - picks it off the floor 
              of the canoe. </p>
            <p> REDCOAT #2<br>
              Spent. </p>
            <p> Distance caught up with eighteenth century ballistics. They're 
              out of smoothbore musket range. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE CANOE]</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (to Heyward)<br>
              Head for ... for the white water. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Do you hear me, sir! <br>
              (exhausted)<br>
              If you ever fall ... into British hands ...<br>
              (breathes)<br>
              What white water? </p>
            <p> HEYWARD &amp; REDCOAT'S POV: LAKE</p>
            <p> divided by a spit of land. The right fork becomes a river with 
              white water rapids. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE CANOE - HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> paddling now, too, as they furiously jam for the white water that 
              will shoot them way ahead of the Hurons. </p>
            <p> UNCAS</p>
            <p> leaps off the stern of Hawkeye's canoe and climbs up the stern 
              of Heyward's and takes control. He roughly gestures to the Redcoat 
              and the Major to stop paddling. He and Hawkeye will pilot the two 
              canoes. </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR WHITE WATER - WIDE - DAY</p>
            <p> The canoes enter the white water and they're so light, they're 
              jet-propelled. </p>
            <p> CANOE POV: EIGHT FOOT WAVE</p>
            <p> racing in the same direction they are. They hit it straight on 
              and it shoots over them and they're drenched by two waves coming 
              from the sides. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE &amp; CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> paddle like fiends to get momentum and control. </p>
            <p> UNCAS' CANOE</p>
            <p> Same thing. When they crested the wave Uncas hollers at them to 
              &quot;pull&quot; and they do. As soon as they're through it, Uncas 
              slams the paddle in the water and makes the canoe revolve a hundred 
              and eighty degrees in a vortex so that now it's going through stern-first 
              or the stern becomes the bow, so that Uncas could pilot it a different 
              way<br>
              through a hazard of ... </p>
            <p> EXPOSED ROCKS</p>
            <p> jutting out of the water. </p>
            <p> WIDE - BOTH CANOES</p>
            <p> Hawkeye didn't have to turn because Chingachgook, at the bow, 
              uses his paddle to shove the canoe away from jutting rocks. Uncas 
              does the same. Past the jutting rocks, Uncas swings it back around 
              while ... </p>
            <p> WHITE WATER</p>
            <p> smashes into the camera. </p>
            <p> ALICE &amp; CORA</p>
            <p> as the canoe roller-coasters and water bursts the bow. Then suddenly 
              it's through and the water is miraculously smooth. </p>
            <p> CANOES</p>
            <p> The Ranger, the Redcoats and even Heyward feel the exhilaration 
              of the ride. That's because they think they're home free.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Here's where it gets tricky ... </p>
            <p> Heyward turns to look in front of him. He doesn't know what the 
              hell Hawkeye's talking about. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD'S POV: THE RIVER AHEAD</p>
            <p> looks glass-smoth. Although there is a distant ROAR of sorts. 
              Then Heyward realizes: something's wrong with this picture. </p>
            <p> CLOSER: HEYWARD</p>
            <p> The look on his face starts to change. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD'S POV: TIGHTER</p>
            <p> The glass surface of the river continues to a line then falls 
              off the end of the world. The river just ends ... </p>
            <p> BOTH CANOES: HEYWARD, REDCOATS, THE RANGER</p>
            <p> realize they're heading for the lip of a waterfall. There's a 
              couple of outcroppings of rock in the center at the very edge. We 
              are at Glen Falls.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Don't move ... </p>
            <p> AERIAL SHOT</p>
            <p> from the other side of the falls. It's a two hundred foot high, 
              death-defying cataract. The canoes - slightly above us - will go 
              right over. </p>
            <p> TWO CANOES</p>
            <p> At the last moment, Hawkeye &amp; Uncas land both on either side 
              of the larger rock outcropping. It is literally at the lip of the 
              falls. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> grabs a rock to anchor the bow of the canoe. He loses his grip. 
              The canoe rockets for the edge. </p>
            <p> UNCAS</p>
            <p> lurches sideways, grabs a tree root. He is the only link of the 
              canoe to earth. The bow, with Heyward, is literally hanging over 
              the edge. Uncas strains and pulls the canoe to the rock. He gestures 
              to Heyward. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> crawls forward and makes the island. Then the two Redcoats. Finally 
              Uncas. The canoe rockets over the falls. Meanwhile ... </p>
            <p> THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND</p>
            <p> Hawkeye has beached his canoe and is camouflaging it with driftwood 
              and brush. As they clamber over the high pieces of broken limestone, 
              we see Hawkeye is slipping into a crevice. He motions to Cora. Uncas 
              carries the wounded Ranger. Heyward helps Alice ... </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> INTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVES - FISSURE - TWILIGHT</p>
            <p> The irregular opening of medium blue sky is obscured by the black 
              silhouetted forms of Hawkeye, Cora and then the others entering.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Where do we go from here? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              We don't. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              I don't understand! </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              This is it, as far as we can go ... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' 
              we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed 
              cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over <br>
              the falls. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Then what? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross 
              country to Fort Edward. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              And if we're unlucky? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me. </p>
            <p> REVERSE: WIDE</p>
            <p> Hawkeye helps Cora; Heyward, the Ranger. Chingachgook carries 
              Alice, down the rockface into a cave. We hear a distant ROAR reverberating 
              off the walls. </p>
            <p> ANOTHER ANGLE: THE WALLS</p>
            <p> are scooped out, bone-like hollows eroded by tumbling water. At 
              an earlier time the formation was part of the falls. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE &amp; CORA</p>
            <p> reach the irregular floor of the chamber. The ROAR is louder. 
            </p>
            <p> WIDEN TO REVEAL</p>
            <p> a curtain of falling water. They're behind the cataract, probably 
              a third of the way down its height. Light through the water stikes 
              them with a silver luminescence. They're exhausted. The others join 
              them. They almost have to shout to be heard. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> followed by Uncas, takes stock of their supplies. They check their 
              powder. They have almost none. Uncas shares his with Hawkeye. The 
              Redcoat's cartridge case is soaked, the paper cartridges a soggy 
              mess. Heyward has none. The Ranger has two left. In Mohican, Chingachgook 
              decides some things. Hawkeye and Uncas nod. Heyward approaches Hawkeye.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Any powder? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE:<br>
              (crossing to Cora)<br>
              Only one or two loads. </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> is soaked to the bones. Hawkeye strips off his buckskin hunting 
              shirt and wrings it out. Cora turns her back, strips off her white 
              blouse and puts on the faster-drying chamois. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Are we safe? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Maybe ... </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Our father? Did you see my father? </p>
            <p> EXTREME CLOSE UP: HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> The look on his face tells it all </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Tell me! </p>
            <p> TWO SHOT</p>
            <p> Hawkeye takes Cora away from the group and turns her by her shoulders 
              and whispers to her. We don't hear what he says. Cora drops to her 
              knees and places her hands over her eyes and face like a little 
              girl trying to make something bad go away. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> Leads her to a depression, his arm around her shoulders, her face 
              covered and she cries softly into his shoulder. </p>
            <p> EXTREME CLOSE UP: CORA</p>
            <p> says into Hawkeye's ear, after she looks O.S. ...</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Say nothing to Alice ...! </p>
            <p> Hawkeye nods.</p>
            <p> ALICE</p>
            <p> stands in the chamber not far from the wall of water, fascinated 
              with its shimmer. She's oblivious to all the events and everything 
              going on around her ... </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> sees Cora &amp; Hawkeye together and turns away. </p>
            <p> GROUP</p>
            <p> Uncas watches Alice. The wounded Ranger has fallen asleep. The 
              Redcoat is exhausted. Hawkeye &amp; Cora against the wall. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR RIVER BANK - RIVER FALLS ARE IN MIST &amp; RED SKY - 
              TWILIGHT</p>
            <p> A landscape with mist rearlit by the red light of the sun that's 
              already behind the mountains. The blues are turning purple and the 
              greens are turning black and the white highlights of the foaming 
              water are going rose. Reflecting the darkening sky, where the surface 
              isn't broken, the water is fast-moving metal ... SUDDENLY: a shaved 
              head and<br>
              muscled back stands into the foreground. It moves down the shore 
              away from camera. He's followed by other Huron warriors. They're 
              two hundred yards away from Glen Falls island. </p>
            <p> HURON</p>
            <p> looks at the island of rock &amp; trees and tilts his head curiously 
              ... </p>

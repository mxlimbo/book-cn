              HEYWARD<br>
              Second rank fire! Six paces back! Prime! <br>
              Load! Third rank! Present! </p>
            <p> A well-oiled, well-drilled fighting machine, but there are fewer 
              of them. They're getting cut off. They close ranks automatically 
              as a man drops. They're retreating in perfect order. </p>
            <p> HURON WARRIOR</p>
            <p> about to strike a downwards blow is pushed aside by Magua. </p>
            <p> CLOSER: MAGUA</p>
            <p> His eyes drop to what's in front of him. The field goes quiet. 
            </p>
            <p> OVER MAGUA'S SHOULDER: MUNRO</p>
            <p> his lower body is trapped under his dead horse. Magua leans in 
              towards him. </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              Grey Hair. I will cut your heart from your living chest in front 
              of your eyes. As you die, know that I will put under the knife your 
              <br>
              children and wipe your seed from this earth forever ... </p>
            <p> Magua pulls his knife and as he leans down towards Munro ... </p>
            <p> MOHAWK &amp; HURON</p>
            <p> spin and flail furiously at each other with tomahawks and knives. 
              The Huron goes down and then the Mohawk is shot. The Huron who shot 
              him is cut down by a Ranger with tomahawk in one hand and bayonet 
              in the other. Two Mohawks and three Rangers fighting back to back. 
              They become an island swamped by Huron and Ottawa: amidst<br>
              bodies and ground slippery with blood. As smoke obscures their image. 
            </p>
            <p> CORA &amp; ALICE</p>
            <p> in a group of civilian militia. Two of the militiamen are shot 
              down. The third engages a Fox warrior. Cora &amp; Alice run. </p>
            <p> MUNRO'S FACE</p>
            <p> frozen in agony by shock. </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> reaching down and up into something, emerges and jams an object 
              we barely see into the air. But his arm and shoulder and half his 
              chest are splashed red with blood. </p>
            <p> LONG SHOT: MAGUA</p>
            <p> seen from far away, holding aloft the heart of Munro. </p>
            <p> REVERSE: HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> saw him and fights his way to attack when ... </p>
            <p> WHITE HORSE</p>
            <p> crazed, CRASHES through men, knocking Hawkeye over ... </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> protecting Hawkeye, slams his war club into one Huron, breaking 
              his attack, his arm and his skull and swings the other way burying 
              the bladed end into the chest of an Ottawa who's behind him. Then 
              ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S</p>
            <p> up, looking wildly ... </p>
            <p> CAMERA JAMS INTO CLEARING SMOKE:</p>
            <p> 33rd Regiment of Foot and Heyward. They FIRE into our face. </p>
            <p> CLOSER: HEYWARD</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Six paces back! Prime! Load! Rank two, <br>
              present! Rank two, hold! </p>
            <p> He grabs a partially loaded musket, the ramrod still in the barrel. 
              They're taking fire. Men are dying. They're being pushed back. </p>
            <p> AN ABNAKI</p>
            <p> wearing a large cross, attacks Heyward from the side. One-handed, 
              Heyward fires the musket into the man's chest, sending the ramrod 
              through him. Then Heyward's shot in the thigh and a thrown tomahawk 
              hits him in the head and knocks him sideways.<br>
              Dazed. Barely able to stand. He uses the musket as a cane and ...</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Rank two, six paces back! Rank one, <br>
              present! </p>
            <p> Rank two did not retreat six paces. They stand in confusion. Heyward 
              looks to see what's wrong. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD'S POV: THE REMNANTS OF THE 33RD REGIMENT OF FOOT</p>
            <p> are standing in water. They're up against Lake George. Their backs 
              are to the wall. Last stand. Heyward straightens. </p>
            <p> TWO FRENCH OFFICERS</p>
            <p> on horseback try to intercede in the slaughter of five women. 
              One French officer is shot by a Huron. The other French officer 
              runs through that Huron and shoots the second. Then his horse is 
              shot out from under him and he goes down ... </p>
            <p> JESUIT</p>
            <p> pleads with an Abnaki to give up a child he's holding by the legs 
              in one hand. He offers his cross. The Abnaki throws the baby to 
              the Jesuit, Pere Roubaud. </p>
            <p> UNCAS</p>
            <p> sees a flash of something yellow. So does Hawkeye. They charge 
              into the swirling chaos of attacking bodies. As we lose sight of 
              them ... </p>
            <p> ALICE</p>
            <p> on her hands and knees. A massive Ottawa pulls her upright by 
              her hair about to take her life and her scalp. He's struck by a 
              rock in the hands of Cora which barely phases him. He bats her aside 
              and returns to Alice, when suddenly ... </p>
            <p> OTTAWA WARRIOR</p>
            <p> is spun, punched and tomahawked into the ground by Hawkeye. Uncas 
              has Alice and Cora ... </p>
            <p> TWO RANGERS AND A MOHAWK WARRIOR</p>
            <p> from the earlier group are nearby. They combine with Hawkeye to 
              fight their way out with bayonets and tomahawks. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, TWO RANGERS, A MOHAWK &amp; MUNRO'S 
              DAUGHTERS</p>
            <p> back through the swirling smoke. There seems to be a lull. Then 
              they're hit from the side by musket fire. One of the Rangers is 
              shot, the other wounded. Hurons attack. The Mohawk supports the 
              wounded Ranger. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> shields Cora as they back up. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> smashing his war club straight down on a Huron, reaches for the 
              man's musket and shoots another. Then he sees ... </p>
            <p> SMOKE DRIFTING OVER WATER</p>
            <p> It's glass-smooth. And the bows are barely visible of three or 
              four Huron war canoes. </p>
            <p> THE SHALLOWS - HAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK, UNCAS, CORA, ALICE, THE 
              RANGER &amp; THE MOHAWK</p>
            <p> back into the water. They're pursued by Ottawa and Hurons as they 
              fight their way to the canoes. </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> held up by Hawkeye, suddenly screams. </p>
            <p> ANGLE</p>
            <p> something underwater is pulling her down. An Ottawa brave rockets 
              out of the shallows. Before he's erect, Hawkeye slams him back into 
              the water and FIRES. </p>
            <p> WOUNDED RANGER</p>
            <p> has shoved a large birch canoe at them. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> Suddenly, the Mohawk fighting with them is shot and spins to face 
              Hawkeye. His hands rest on Hawkeye's shoulders. Hawkeye looks into 
              his face. Tries to hold him up, tries to rescue him. A frozen moment. 
              Hawkeye's staring into his eyes and the man is staring<br>
              into Hawkeye's as the light goes out ... Hawkeye lets him slide 
              into the water and float away. He moves Cora and Alice towards the 
              canoe ... </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE - WATER &amp; SWIRLING SMOKE - DAY</p>
            <p> The bottom of the frame is water like glass. Smoke obscures the 
              background. Fingers tendril towards us. Out of the mist we HEAR 
              small splashing and then the high bow of a war canoe defines itself. 
              It's paddled towards us. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK &amp; UNCAS</p>
            <p> Cora's behind Hawkeye. Alice and the wounded Ranger are near Uncas. 
            </p>
            <p> CLOSER: HAWKEYE &amp; CORA</p>
            <p> Cora looks left. Her eyes go wide. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              No! </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> spins. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD &amp; TWO TROOPERS OF THE 33RD IN A SECOND CANOE</p>
            <p> have emerged from the smoke ten feet from them. Heyward's aiming 
              a horse pistol at Hawkeye. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> is non-plussed. He doesn't stop paddling. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              You got nothin' better to do today on Lake George than shoot me, 
              Major, then go ahead ... </p>
            <p> Heyward's a hair's breadth from firing. Suddenly they hear the 
              boom of muskets and rounds come in. </p>
            <p> WIDE</p>
            <p> They're being pursued by three boatloads - and then a fourth and 
              fifth - of Huron. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> is indifferent to Huron musket balls. Hawkeye hasn't stopped paddling 
              and pays Heyward no heed.</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Stop it!! </p>
            <p> Heyward comes to his senses. His head is gashed. A scarf, as a 
              tourniquet, is tied around his leg. He lowers the gun. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              When you fall into British hands again, Nathaniel Poe, I will have 
              you hanged. </p>
            <p> HURON CANOES</p>
            <p> paddle hard and deep and the canoes power across the lake. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE &amp; HEYWARD'S CANOES</p>
            <p> with less paddlers, plus wounded, are slower and will be overtaken. 
            </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> looks to Uncas. They both realize the same thing. Hawkeye nods 
              and he, Uncas &amp; Chingachgook begin to paddle furiously. The 
              others match the doubled pace. They're sprinting ahead but the effort 
              is exhausting. </p>
            <p> HURON CANOES</p>
            <p> maintain their steady pace. Three or four Hurons fire. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S CANOE</p>
            <p> Musket balls ricochet on the water's surface. One rips a hole 
              through the bow. Hawkeye sees one of the Redcoats in Heyward's canoe 
              is giving out ... </p>
            <p> REDCOAT #1<br>
              Can't ... keep it up ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Pull! </p>
            <p> He renews the attack on the water with the paddle.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (shouts)<br>
              How long? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (shouts)<br>
              Only chance we got is ... <br>
              (breathless)<br>
              ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground! </p>
            <p> Heyward digs in. Like firecrackers in the distance, Huron muskets 
              sound. A new hail of musket balls cut the fabric of the canoes. 
              One Redcoat is shot in the back. He falls overboard.</p>

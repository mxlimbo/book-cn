              EXTERIOR FOREST, TRAIL - MAGUA - DAY </p>
            <p> on point. The trail cuts the side of a hill. The ground on one 
              side rises into a forest acclivity and on the other falls off into 
              a forested ravine. Magua walking towards camera. </p>
            <p> CLOSER - MAGUA'S</p>
            <p> slid his tomahawk out from the front of his belt that girdles 
              his waist. He lets the shaft drop into his hand. He shrugs off his 
              blanket. There is a solidity to his dark, tall figure we didn't 
              see before. Magua turns about face and advances on the column. <br>
              TRACK WITH Magua.<br>
              Heyward and the Munro girls pass the camera as does Sgt. Major Ambrose, 
              marching in advance of the men. Magua is approaching the soldier 
              on the left in the first row. <br>
              We see Magua has caught the Redcoat's eye.</p>
            <p> REDCOAT</p>
            <p> is curious, starts to smile. What does the Huron want to say to 
              him? When Magua is two steps away he caves in the side of the infantryman's 
              head at the temple with the spike end of his tomahawk and, backhanded, 
              hacks the blade through the side of the<br>
              neck of the center man in the first row. </p>
            <p> SIMULTANEOUSLY</p>
            <p> thirteen muskets EXPLODE from the wooded rise. </p>
            <p> FIVE REDCOATS</p>
            <p> are blown off the path, two others are wounded ... </p>
            <p> AMBROSE</p>
            <p> AMBROSE<br>
              Form company! Left face! March! </p>
            <p> ALICE</p>
            <p> shrieks. Cora grabs Alice's reins and her own. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> pulling his fusil (short musket), seeing, firing, reaching for 
              the women ... </p>
            <p> CORA'S HORSE</p>
            <p> bucking. </p>
            <p> ALICE'S HORSE</p>
            <p> bolting, dodging sideways, spilling Alice to the earth. </p>
            <p> AMBROSE</p>
            <p> AMBROSE<br>
              Company make ready! </p>
            <p> The regulars slam into a firing line, stepping over the bodies 
              of their comrades. All thirteen face the incline. </p>
            <p> FORESTED RISE - HURONS</p>
            <p> flash downhill through the trees. Partnered in two-man teams, 
              one loads and prepares and fires while the other advances to the 
              next cover. He, then, prepares and fires covering his partner's 
              advance. Leaping fallen trees and boulders, they're athletic, fast 
              and rapidly closing. Even though the disciplined English regulars 
              are a killing machine, we now see their tactics in the dense forest 
              are grossly inferior to the Hurons' ... </p>
            <p> AMBROSE<br>
              Present!! </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> covers Alice with her body, holding the reins of their bolting 
              horses. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> from horseback aims his horse pistol, FIRES ... </p>
            <p> AN ATTACKING HURON</p>
            <p> leaping at him past Alice &amp; Cora drops. </p>
            <p> MULE</p>
            <p> with baggage crashes off, down the ravine. Another two Redcoats 
              drop. Nine left. Then eight. </p>
            <p> AMBROSE</p>
            <p> AMBROSE<br>
              Fire!! </p>
            <p> A musket volley as eight muskets go off as one shot, sending a 
              lead scythe through leaves. But ... </p>
            <p> REVERSE:</p>
            <p> Hurons were behind cover. Only one was exposed and hit. </p>
            <p> AMBROSE<br>
              (continuing)<br>
              Load! Prime! </p>
            <p> The English rush to complete the reload. Will they do it in time? 
            </p>
            <p> AMBROSE<br>
              (continuing)<br>
              Present! Present! </p>
            <p> Suddenly, Hurons - en masse - CRASH down onto the Redcoats line 
              with tomahawks, war clubs and point-blank musket fire. </p>
            <p> ALICE</p>
            <p> on the ground, screaming insanely, covered by Cora who's protecting 
              her little sister, and ... </p>
            <p> HEYWARD'S</p>
            <p> horse shot from beneath him, the animal folding, falling straight 
              to the earth, and ... </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> shoots Ambrose in the chest, and ... </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> by the Munro daughters spins, swinging his fusil like a ball-bat, 
              upending one Huron and lunges with his bayonet in his left towards 
              another. But this Huron easily slips the thrust and slams Heyward 
              with his rifle butt. </p>
            <p> BRITISH</p>
            <p> dead and dying. </p>
            <p> AMBROSE</p>
            <p> blood gushing from his chest wound, fires his pistol, dropping 
              a Huron; slashes a second with his sword. Then he's chopped down. 
              Hurons begin scalping the British while four race towards Heyward 
              and the two women. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD &amp; CORA &amp; ALICE</p>
            <p> ready to die. Heyward has only his fusil as a bludgeon. He readies 
              ... </p>
            <p> THREE LOUD SHOTS</p>
            <p> BLOW three of the Hurons sideways, head over heels down the rise. 
            </p>
            <p> REVERSE: THREE MEN</p>
            <p> barely seen, running diagonally across the fall line of the ravine. 
              In parts, we recognize Nathaniel, recharging Killdeer on full run, 
              and Uncas. </p>
            <p> HURON'S</p>
            <p> not sure where the shots came from. Suddenly Chingachgook slams 
              him, head first into the ravine with the war club. He didn't even 
              slow down. </p>
            <p> HURON</p>
            <p> warrior spins. Uncas tomahawks his shoulder. The Huron swings 
              downwards. Uncas ducks beneath the swing and slashes his throat, 
              sending him downhill into CAMERA as ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S</p>
            <p> momentum and thrown tomahawk spread-eagles one Huron, near a couple 
              of wounded Redcoats who fight on ... </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> calmly sees the odds have changed. His attention becomes focused. 
              He commits a very revealing act seen through the blurred foreground 
              action of struggling bodies. We will remember it. He raises his 
              musket and aims at ... </p>
            <p> CORA MUNRO</p>
            <p> who's unaware she's a target. Why is he singling out a Munro girl 
              to kill? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> sees. Killdeer's at his shoulder ... </p>
            <p> TIME SLOWS: MAGUA</p>
            <p> senses Hawkeye. Moving through liquid, his eyes drift left. The 
              moment is frozen. Their eyes lock, each to the other's. Then ... 
            </p>
            <p> TIME UNFREEZES</p>
            <p> Magua swings at Hawkeye and FIRES ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> shifts. The .65 caliber musket ball rockets past his ear and he's 
              already squeezing Killdeer's trigger as ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S POV OVER BARREL: SMOKE</p>
            <p> from Magua's musket blast clears. Magua's gone. He almost shape-shifted, 
              it happened so quickly. It's nearly mystical. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> lowers Killdeer, impressed. </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> glances back at Hawkeye. She doesn't know why he's looking at 
              her. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> pursues two fleeing Hurons up the incline. Two strides gain him 
              the first man, who he hamstrings and runs over to pursue the second 
              up the hill ... as ... </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> in the confused melee, grabs a found musket and aims it at an 
              Indian. We recognize that he's aiming at Chingachgook pursuing the 
              second Huron up the hill ... </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              No, Duncan! </p>
            <p> Duncan ignores her. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD'S MUSKET</p>
            <p> is jerked from his hands.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              ... case your aim is any better'n your judgment. </p>
            <p> He's drawn his sword, reflexively. Hawkeye flips the musket around 
              one-handed. It's pointed at Heyward's chest. And Hawkeye FIRES, 
              killing an attacking Huron behind Heyward. As Heyward spins ... 
            </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK'S WAR CLUB</p>
            <p> flashes up the hill. It cleaves the second man's back and bowls 
              him over. Chingachgook retrieves his club as his scalping knife 
              slashes down ... </p>
            <p> UNCAS</p>
            <p> scalps the man he killed. Chingachgook dispatches the Huron he 
              hamstrung. </p>
            <p> WIDE</p>
            <p> Sudden silence. Heyward's motionless. The women are frozen, as 
              terrified of the savages and apparent half-breed rescuers as they 
              were of those who attacked them. </p>
            <p> ALICE</p>
            <p> Cora, holding her, is stunned but functioning. Moments ago both 
              women were clean and demure. Now their riding dresses are torn, 
              mud-stained, blood-spattered and their baggage is gone. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD'S</p>
            <p> crossed to his slaughtered soldiers. Moments ago they were a testament 
              to British military power. Now they're dead meat. Ambrose's body 
              is against a tree. In the B.G. two of the wounded start to rise 
              ... </p>
            <p> ALICE<br>
              (O.S.)<br>
              Stop it! </p>
            <p> Heyward spins. </p>
            <p> UNCAS</p>
            <p> just cut the throat of the second Narraganset. It drops into the 
              brush. Alice attacks him.</p>
            <p> ALICE<br>
              We need them to get out of here! </p>
            <p> Uncas gently restrains her. Cora reaches Alice and grabs her away 
              from the &quot;savage&quot;.<br>
              Heyward runs in to protect the women ...</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (to Nathaniel)<br>
              ... why the bloody hell he do that to the horses?! </p>
            <p> Uncas, all business, is now reloading, lifting powder horns, scanning 
              the trees.</p>
            <p> UNCAS<br>
              (matter of fact) <br>
              ... too easy to track ... they can be heard for <br>
              miles ... find yourself a musket ... </p>
            <p> Cora's surprised by Uncas' easy English. Hawkeye's scanning the 
              forest.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (to Heyward)<br>
              Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany. <br>
              They'll never make a passage north. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (breathless)<br>
              We were headed ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (appropriating a knife)<br>
              ... Fort William Henry. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> to Hawkeye: let's go ... Then a fast exchange of Delaware. Cora's 
              surprised to see it's Chingachgook's decision. Chingachgook looks 
              at the survivors, gives his assent, starts off.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              ... take you as far as the fort. </p>
            <p> Hawkeye throws Heyward a musket. Cora &amp; Alice look towards 
              Heyward. He looks at them: the women are totally terrified and do 
              not move.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              If we are goin' to take you, we need to move. Fast ... And the fort 
              is well off our course. So if you all rather wait for the next Huron 
              <br>
              war party to come by, we'll be on our way. </p>
            <p> Heyward quickly decides to go. The women follow. Hawkeye starts 
              off after Uncas and Chingachgook. </p>

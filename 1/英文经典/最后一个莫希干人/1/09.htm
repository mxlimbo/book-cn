              EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - COURIER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> sprints for the trees during the diversion of Heyward's sally. 
            </p>
            <p> TWO HURONS</p>
            <p> materialize from nowhere and charge at him ... both are BLOWN 
              off their feet by ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY, CASEMENT - UNCAS &amp; HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> now handed already-loaded, primed and cocked rifles while the 
              four men behind them reload the two just fired. Hawkeye gestures 
              ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR HILLSIDE - THREE HALF-SAVAGE CANADIENS</p>
            <p> are running down the hill to intercept the courier. One fires 
              ... </p>
            <p> COURIER</p>
            <p> a near miss. </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> FIRES. A half second later, Uncas FIRES. </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR HILLSIDE</p>
            <p> One Canadien's falling through the trees as the second one's hit 
              by Uncas' shot. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> reaches out his hand. Killdeer with the heavier load is slapped 
              into it. Hawkeye aims. Looks away a second and comes back to the 
              sight in deep concentration. The world goes silent ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S POV: COURIER &amp; CANADIEN</p>
            <p> pursuer are barely visible. Only patches appear momentarily between 
              the trees. They're three hundred yards away: an impossible shot 
              in 1757. </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FOREST - THE CANADIEN</p>
            <p> will intersect the courier. His arm is back with his tomahawk 
              to throw ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> judges wind, elevates the long rifle ... and FIRES at us. </p>
            <p> JUMP CUT BACK: </p>
            <p> TREES</p>
            <p> Hawkeye's heavy round rips through. We HEAR the ball cut air. 
              A few leaves flutter ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FOREST - CANADIEN</p>
            <p> whacked head over heels by the impact. </p>
            <p> COURIER</p>
            <p> looks over his shoulder. He didn't know the Canadien was there. 
              He stumbles in the half light. Then he runs on ... </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - WEST SALLY-PORT</p>
            <p> The three companies of the 62nd Regiment of Foot file back into 
              the fort in perfect order. The sally-port is closed. Three men are 
              wounded. The diversion worked perfectly. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Sergeant Major! </p>
            <p> SERGEANT MAJOR<br>
              Sir! </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men. </p>
            <p> SERGEANT MAJOR<br>
              Atten-hut! </p>
            <p> TROOPERS &amp; MILITIA</p>
            <p> have seen no action for three days &amp; nights. Heyward got their 
              blood running and won their respect. They step aside and nod to 
              him. Heyward keeps walking. He is home. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> INTERIOR MUNRO'S BEDCHAMBER - DOOR - NIGHT</p>
            <p> a knock and Heyward enters. </p>
            <p> CORA &amp; ALICE</p>
            <p> Alice is in her father's bed. Cora is collecting and tearing linen 
              into strips for bandaging.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Cora ... I wanted to talk to you, but I'll come back another time 
              ... </p>
            <p> Alice looks at the two of them and rises out of the bed.</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Alice ... </p>
            <p> ALICE<br>
              Talk to Duncan, Cora ... I must manage ... <br>
              I cannot be an invalid schoolgirl. <br>
              (starts<br>
              for door)<br>
              I'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything ... </p>
            <p> She leaves.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ... </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Her nerves are shattered. She's trying to be brave. </p>
            <p> There's a lot going on under Cora's surface. We don't know what 
              it is, but it's disconcerting.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest 
              couple in England ... I am certain of that. More than ever before. 
              <br>
              (softens)<br>
              I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare 
              so close to their hearts ... </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Duncan ... <br>
              (pause)<br>
              Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with 
              your persistence and patience ... But the decision I've come to 
              is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own 
              judgment. </p>
            <p> Heyward is stunned.</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              And it's been unfair to you, while I search myself for feelings, 
              which, if they were there and as strong as they ought to be, <br>
              would've made themselves known long ago ...<br>
              (pause)<br>
              Take my admiration and friendship, Duncan. <br>
              And please take this as my final answer. <br>
              It must be no. </p>
            <p> Heyward' shattered inside.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              I see ... </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              I am sorry, Duncan ... </p>
            <p> Heyward nods. He's speechless. He's errect as he leaves the room. 
            </p>
            <p> CLOSE: CORA</p>
            <p> The tension rushes out of her and she shudders and leans against 
              the quarter-timbered walls for support. Then she collects the linen 
              and starts out. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> INTERIOR FORT, INNER CORRIDOR - CORA</p>
            <p> moving through the corridor past wounded. Two French mortar bombs 
              explode above one of the casements. We hear shrill screams in the 
              distance and ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE (O.S.)<br>
              ... it was no raidin' party out for pillage. The cabin was attacked 
              by a war party. They are sweeping south down the frontier spreading 
              <br>
              terror among farms and Mohawk villages 'cos all the men are here. 
            </p>
            <p> IAN (O.S.)<br>
              And my cabin's not thirteen miles south of Cameron's! </p>
            <p> Cora, passing the open door to Munro's crowded office, now hesitates. 
            </p>
            <p> CORA'S POV: THE ROOM</p>
            <p> Hawkeye, Captain Jack Winthrop, Ian, seven or eight other militia 
              spokesmen, Munro, Heyward, two adjutants, one lieutenant of Rangers.</p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              (to Jack)<br>
              I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before 
              I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw. </p>
            <p> JACK<br>
              Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. 
              Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, 
              <br>
              not these colonials' presence. </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement 
              with Webb to defend their farms &amp; families ... Major Heyward 
              was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was. </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              (looking to Heyward for confirmation of his point of view) <br>
              What did you see, Major? </p>
            <p> Heyward looks around the room. And he catches the doorway ... 
            </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> beyond the periphery of men, staring at him. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British 
              military interests.<br>
              At the same time ... </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> examines him with a cool, level stare. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> looks at Munro. More French rounds detonate O.S. What if Webb 
              gets here and they need to launch a counter-attack? They need every 
              man they have. It's his moment of decision ... </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (to Munro)<br>
              I saw nothing that would lead me to the conclusion it was other 
              than a raid by savages bent on thievery. </p>
            <p> Jack Winthrop grabs Nathaniel.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              You're a liar! </p>
            <p> CORA'S</p>
            <p> saddened. Heyward's stature has fallen irrevocably in her eyes. 
            </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> can't help it. He turns to look at Cora ... </p>
            <p> HEYWARD'S POV: DOORWAY</p>
            <p> She's gone. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> suffused with an inner sadness, turns to Hawkeye.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              And the blood is on your hands! </p>
            <p> Heyward reaches for his sword. </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              (to Heyward) <br>
              I'll have none of that! <br>
              (to colonials) <br>
              Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. <br>
              Not a butcher. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not 
              yours, alone in their farms! </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              (exploding)<br>
              You forget yourself! </p>
            <p> JACK<br>
              We are not forgettin' Webb's promise! </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. 
              Because I need more definite proof than this man's word! </p>
            <p> JACK<br>
              Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you 
              got here! </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              This interview's over! The militia stays! </p>
            <p> JACK<br>
              (to Munro) <br>
              Does the rule of English law no longer govern? <br>
              Has it been replaced by absolutism? </p>
            <p> This is very dangerous talk.</p>

              EXTERIOR FOREST - HAWKEYE - DAY</p>
            <p> moves through the trackless forest. Uncas is far out on the left 
              flank. Cora, Alice &amp; Duncan Heyward follow in Hawkeye's and 
              Chingachgook's steps ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S FEET</p>
            <p> walking through a creek, stepping in the stream bed instead of 
              on stones. The others follow. Hawkeye looks at Heyward. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> conforms. He's ill at ease not being in command, following the 
              lead of some half-Indian frontiersman through a foreign wilderness.] 
            </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              How far is it, scout? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Day and a half <br>
              (pause) <br>
              Where did you get ... the guide? </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              He is Huron and nothing else. <br>
              (checking the Munro girls are not too close)<br>
              Why would he want to murder the girl? </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              What?! </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Dark haired ... </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult? </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Of course not! <br>
              (pause) <br>
              And how is it you were nearby? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Came across the war party, tracked 'em. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              No. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Fort Edward, then? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia? </p>
            <p> Off to the side, Uncas smiles at the idea.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              I ain't your &quot;scout&quot;. And I am in no damn militia. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (stops) <br>
              Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone 
              while she protects you from France? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              England does not protect me and does not war against France on our 
              account. She uses us to war against France on her own account ... 
              <br>
              of greed for land and furs. </p>
            <p> CORA'S</p>
            <p> appalled.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (turns) <br>
              Clear it up any? </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (loud) <br>
              I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out! </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (low)<br>
              Do not let gratitude get in the way ... </p>
            <p> Cora's hand holds back Heyward's sword arm because suddenly Chingachgook 
              looms over him.</p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK<br>
              (to Hawkeye) <br>
              Yengeese no good in woods. Make more noise, I kill him. </p>
            <p> Heyward spins. Hawkeye coolly watches Cora. Her attitude is hostile; 
              aligned with Heyward. He turns away. Meanwhile ... </p>
            <p> UNCAS</p>
            <p> stops, alarmed. Something in the air bothers him. Hawkeye smells 
              it, too. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> is already moving out front, low and fast ... </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FOREST, TREE LINE - GREEN BRANCHES - DAY</p>
            <p> After we HOLD, we realize Chingachgook's been there all along. 
              Hawkeye and Uncas join him where the branches meet the ground. Smoke 
              drifts through the trees. Hawkeye sees and dips his head, then looks 
              again ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR CAMERON CABIN - WIDE - DAY</p>
            <p> Burned, smoldering, having fallen in on itself. TRACK LEFT past 
              what was the doorway. A dead child's hand protruding from the ruin. 
              A fragment of a dress. Charred and smoldering wood. John Cameron's 
              body in the wreckage. And then, through the<br>
              collapsed posts and timbers, Hawkeye, Chingachgook and Uncas have 
              advanced and are seeing what we've just seen; and then Cora and 
              Alice. </p>
            <p> ALICE</p>
            <p> approaches and is frozen in horror. Cora shields her from the 
              sight. Cora is affected but confronts it directly.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (O.S.) <br>
              Anything to be done? </p>
            <p> UNCAS</p>
            <p> returns from under one part of the wreckage, ashen, stoic, as 
              they all are. We know the degree of their inner pain.</p>
            <p> UNCAS<br>
              All dead ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> bends over a moccasin print that Chingachgook's examining. They 
              look at each other grimly. Heyward joins them.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Who were these people? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (re: print) <br>
              Ottawa! </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Excuse me ... </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK<br>
              (to Hawkeye) <br>
              Ottawa. </p>
            <p> UNCAS</p>
            <p> enters, very careful where he places his feet ... Hawkeye gestures 
              to Heyward to stay where he is: on the periphery with the women.</p>
            <p> UNCAS<br>
              Mirrors ... tools ... clothes ... all inside. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (to Chingachgook)<br>
              Movin' fast, not able to carry much ... <br>
              this was a war party? </p>
            <p> Chingachgook nods confirmation and indicates a direction in Mohican. 
              The significance is very ominous to them. We don't know why yet. 
              Chingachgook starts away ... </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Let us look after them ... </p>
            <p> He starts approaching the bodies.</p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK<br>
              Leave them. </p>
            <p> Heyward stops. Hawkeye and Uncas follow Chingachgook, leaving 
              the cabin.</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              (hasn't moved)<br>
              Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian 
              burial! </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (shaking his head) <br>
              Let us go, miss. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never 
              war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference. 
            </p>
            <p> Hawkeye turns back and rapidly approaches her. She takes a step 
              back, fearful.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (contained)<br>
              Miss Munro.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              They are not strangers .... <br>
              And they stay as they lay ...! </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> realizes Hawkeye knew these people and is deeply affected. She 
              also realizes for the first time this is a whole new world with 
              dynamics and complexities, behavior and rhythms she doesn't understand. 
              He turns away from her and walks on. She hesitates a moment. </p>
            <p> WIDE ON THE SMALL CLEARING IN FRONT OF THE FARMHOUSE</p>
            <p> as Chingachgook and Hawkeye, extremely alert and cradling their 
              cocked flintlocks, walk to camera, eyes sweeping the forest perimeter; 
              they're followed by Cora, Heyward helping Alice and Uncas as rearguard.</p>
            <p> The ruined cabin and the dead dream of a family smolders behind 
              them. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR GLADE - PROFILE: HAWKEYE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> moves through to where the trees seem sparse and are unnaturally 
              white birch and some thin grass grows. The land rises into a mound. 
              Chingachgook and the others avoid stepping on the grass and cross 
              to the other side of it. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> mutters something to Uncas. He nods and disappears amongst the 
              white birch, soundlessly. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> throws Heyward a blanket. Heyward spreads the blanket below the 
              top of the mound and - maintaining silence - he gestures for Cora 
              &amp; Alice to rest there. </p>
            <p> ALICE'S HEAD</p>
            <p> hits the blanket. She curls into a fetal position and she's out. 
              Heyward is nearby on watch.<br>
              Hawkeye has taken a position two-thirds of the way around the crescent 
              shaped mound.<br>
              Cora has sought him out. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> doesn't react as Cora enters. He's scanning the trees; not looking 
              at her. <br>
              They whisper ... </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Why didn't you bury those people? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our 
              passing ... </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              You knew them. </p>
            <p> Hawkeye looks at her and nods.</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              (stiffly)<br>
              You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood 
              you. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Well that is to be expected. My father ... </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Your &quot;father&quot;? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              He did? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Yes. He said ... &quot;do not try to make them understand you.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              What?! </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Yes. And &quot;do not try to understand them. That is because they 
              are a breed apart and they make no sense ...&quot; </p>
            <p> Cora's indignation is cut off because ... </p>
            <p> UNCAS</p>
            <p> moving fast. He gestures back the way he came and it means they're 
              in jeopardy. Uncas disappears around the mound. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR BIRCH FOREST - TREES - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Nothing. Imperceptibly we move closer and start to see shapes 
              blocking out part of the white birch. </p>
            <p> RED-PAINTED FACE</p>
            <p> white eyes. A ruff of red hair stands straight up at the back 
              of the large man's head. Slit and monstrously elongated earlobes 
              are weighted with silver. He's followed by others. Wary, silently, 
              they hunt. </p>
            <p> DEEPER: MORE OTTAWA</p>
            <p> Towards the rear are two French Rangers (&quot;Coureurs des Bois&quot;) 
              from Le Regiment de la Sarre. They're bearded, dirty, dressed Indian-style 
              in moccasins, leggings and breechcloths with hooded hunting shirts. 
              There's nothing clumsy about them. They're the 18th century version 
              of Special Forces who've gone indigenous. If they and the<br>
              Ottawa find our people, it's all over. </p>
            <p> ALICE</p>
            <p> seeing the red-painted Ottawa approach, starts to panic. Her hyperventilating 
              and involuntary small sounds of fear will reveal their position. 
              A hand covers her mouth and silences her struggling. WIDEN. It's 
              Uncas. His other arm is around her, holding her,<br>
              looking towards the advancing Ottawa. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> on his back, his tomahawk within reach on the ground. </p>
            <p> OTTAWA &amp; FRENCH</p>
            <p> are fifty yards away from the crescent mound behind which lie 
              our people. Mist envelops them ... </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> His massive arms spread revealing his war club in his left fist; 
              his fusil in his right hand. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> waiting for the attack. Cora's eyes are anxious, but there's no 
              terror there. Nathaniel's impressed with her cool. He hands her 
              a pistol. She takes it. He listens for the soft drop of moccasined 
              feet ... </p>
            <p> OTTAWA</p>
            <p> through the grass. Thirty feet away they stop. They're motionless. 
              Then their leader gestures and they start backing out. The French 
              Rangers continue towards the crescent. The Ottawa chief takes one's 
              arm and stops him. The French Ranger whispers something inaudible. 
              The Ottawa chief shakes his head, &quot;Non. Pas possible ...&quot; 
              <br>
              And means it. They retreat. </p>
            <p> SEPERATE SHOTS: HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, CORA</p>
            <p> tensely monitor the Ottawa retreat. </p>
            <p> UNCAS &amp; ALICE</p>
            <p> He slowly removes his hand from her mouth. She's a little shy, 
              then she looks up, catches his eyes. Then she averts her face. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> sees all of it; doesn't like it. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> The Ottawa are gone.</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              (quietly)<br>
              Why did they turn back? </p>
            <p> In answer Hawkeye looks behind &amp; above her head.</p>

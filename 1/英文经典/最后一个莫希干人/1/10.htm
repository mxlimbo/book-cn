              HAWKEYE<br>
              And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do 
              better makin' a peace with the French! </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              That is sedition! Treason! </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              That is the truth! </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (restaining himself) <br>
              I ought to have you whipped from this fort! </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Major! <br>
              (changes down)<br>
              Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement. 
            </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              (steel) <br>
              Anyone fomenting or advocating leaving Fort William Henry will be 
              hung for sedition. Anyone leaving will be shot for desertion. <br>
              (pause)<br>
              My decision is final. Get out. </p>
            <p> Hawkeye and the others are not intimidated. Their rage smolders. 
              The look on Hawkeye's face says this is not over. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FORT, PARADE GROUND - BONFIRE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Sparks shower skyward. Impromptu music. Some Celtic proto-bluegrass 
              played on fiddle &amp; drums. It's stirring. </p>
            <p> ANOTHER ANGLE: SOME WOMEN</p>
            <p> laundresses, dance from soldier to soldier - English foot and 
              American Rangers. A few people lit by the firelight are solemn. 
              Most are stirred to lift their morale for a while. </p>
            <p> THEIR FACES</p>
            <p> underlit by the red firelight. They are a disposable people, a 
              diverse plurality stuck in a postage stamp-size fort in an ocean 
              of forest, locked into mortal deadly conflict because of the policies 
              of cold and distant European monarchs. </p>
            <p> A PLACE A LITTLE DISTANT FROM THE FIRE</p>
            <p> We can barely make out the eyes and faces of a number of men behind 
              logs, crates and new wreckage from the day's bombardment. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (low)<br>
              ... got no kin in the settlements. If I did, <br>
              I'd be long gone. </p>
            <p> IAN<br>
              You didn't think it right to be here in the first place. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              By my light that's how I saw it then and I see it that way now ... 
            </p>
            <p> IAN<br>
              (low)<br>
              But we are under English military authority. </p>
            <p> JACK<br>
              (low) <br>
              I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their 
              law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over 
              us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer. No force on earth 
              will keep me here ... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. 
              So each <br>
              man make your own decision ... Those who are goin', be back here 
              in an hour. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp 
              until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, 
              then <br>
              come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free 
              of the outpost and skirmishers ... </p>
            <p> A COLONIAL<br>
              (grumbles)<br>
              Should've skinned outta this long ago. </p>
            <p> COLONIAL #2<br>
              Got no families, Captain. Figured we'd stay <br>
              and give 'em a hand even though ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (to Colonial #2)<br>
              I'll cover them from the top of the casement. </p>
            <p> JACK<br>
              (in amazement)<br>
              You're not coming with us? </p>
            <p> Hawkeye shakes his head. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Got a reason to stay. </p>
            <p> JACK<br>
              That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery? </p>
            <p> Low laughter</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (dry)<br>
              It does and it is a better lookin' reason than you, Jack Winthrop. 
              <br>
              (more laughs) <br>
              Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French outpost by dawn. <br>
              (sticks out his hand and grasps Winthrop's) <br>
              Good luck, Jack. </p>
            <p> The men split up ... </p>
            <p> CUT TO ... </p>
            <p> FIRE - HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> wanders among the dancers and musicians clustered in groups, lit 
              by the firelight.<br>
              Someone catches his eye and he moves in that direction ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S POV: CORA</p>
            <p> in the shadows, leaning against the wall, searching ... we sense 
              she's been looking for him. He comes up to her. She turns in surprise. 
            </p>
            <p> CLOSER</p>
            <p> Somehow she breathes easier because he's there. She's in a white 
              shirt with the sleeves rolled up. Hawkeye leads her away from some 
              of the people. </p>
            <p> CORA &amp; HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> Hawkeye takes Cora's hand. Cora is awakening to a new spirit, 
              a new wind blowing through a new land, a new self-determination 
              ... She's drawn to this rough yet graceful man with his direct manner. 
              Hawkeye settles against a wall. She leans next to him.<br>
              Their shoulders touch. </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> To her everything about him seems to be somehow right. She's discovered 
              that the passions and outrage that move him, move her ... And her 
              readiness to give herself to what stirs the deepest resonances of 
              her soul is the same as his. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> looks at her. She's beautiful in the firelight. Cora's eyes find 
              his and she folds into his arms. His lips find hers and tears stream 
              down her face. She's suffused with an elation she can't explain. 
              In the night before doomsday a romance is born in rebellion amid 
              the huddled people in this small stockade ripped from the black 
              earth of the forests of a wild continent. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> INTERIOR BARRACKS - LOW &amp; WIDE - DAY</p>
            <p> door CRASHES inwards. Twelve British sentries storm in. Four bear 
              torches. </p>
            <p> REVERSE: HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, TWO COLONIALS &amp; SOME 
              MOHAWKS</p>
            <p> are out of the bunks and moving with them with tomahawks, knives, 
              a flintlock ... </p>
            <p> SERGEANT (O.S.)<br>
              You! Halt! </p>
            <p> BRITISH SENTRIES</p>
            <p> their muskets aimed mostly at Hawkeye.</p>
            <p> SERGEANT<br>
              As you were!! </p>
            <p> Hawkeye freezes. The others slow down, indecisive ... Hawkeye 
              drops his tomahawk and says something in Mohican to restrain Chingachgook 
              and Uncas. The British in the torchlight with the long muskets and 
              bayonets are an image out of Goya. </p>
            <p> SERGEANT<br>
              Take him! </p>
            <p> Hawkeye's spun around and while his hands are bound. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK<br>
              (Mohican; subtitled)<br>
              Why do they make my son prisoner? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (Mohican; subtitled)<br>
              I helped Winthrop and the others leave ... This fight is not yours, 
              father. I love you and my brother. And you should leave <br>
              this place now and go to Can-tuck-ee ... </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK<br>
              (Mohican; subtitled)<br>
              What will they do with my white son? </p>
            <p> One of the guards - scared to death by Chingachgook - nervously 
              fingers his musket. </p>
            <p> GUARD<br>
              Get back from him! </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> enters. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> shrugs in answer to Chingachgook's question. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S</p>
            <p> moved out. As he passes Heyward, his eyes lock on his. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> INTERIOR MUNRO'S QUARTERS - CORA - DAY</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              He saved us! We are alive only because of him ... </p>
            <p> WIDEN:</p>
            <p> Heyward, Munro, Cora. We've entered mid-argument. An adjutant 
              comes and goes. Heyward and Munro are sensitive to appearances in 
              front of the adjutant. Cora couldn't give a damn. </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in 
              my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged 
              <br>
              like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children. 
            </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              He knew the consequences. And he stayed. Are those the actions of 
              a criminal? ... Duncan, do something. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              He knew the penalty for breaking regulations. </p>
            <p><br>
              He ought to pay without sending you to beg. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              You know he wouldn't send me ...! You misrepresented what you saw 
              and caused this. <br>
              (frustrated)<br>
              I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said ... </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this 
              fort. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's 
              policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as 
              a &quot;by your leave.&quot; </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              They do not live their lives &quot;by your leave.&quot; ... They 
              hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying 
              their dead and <br>
              their children along the way. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (distant)<br>
              You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.</p>
            <p> Cora is having her intelligence written off as a hormone attack. 
              She contains her fury. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Duncan, you are a man with a few admirable qualities. But taken 
              as a whole, I was wrong to have thought so highly of you. </p>
            <p> Heyward's shot through the heart.</p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice 
              and beyond pardon. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              &quot;Justice&quot;? If that's &quot;justice&quot; ..., then the 
              sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better 
              it will be for these people. </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              You do not know what you are saying! </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              (explodes)<br>
              Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying. And if it is sedition, 
              then I am guilty of sedition, too! </p>
            <p> She exits, leaving them there. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> INTERIOR FORT, STOCKADE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Heavy timbered door. A sentry. They stand at attention when Cora 
              passes as opposed to barring her entry. </p>
            <p> INTERIOR CELL - HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> comes to the door, grips the bars with his hands and looks at 
              Cora. </p>
            <p> THROUGH THE BARS TO CORA</p>
            <p> They are silent for a moment, then ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Sorry ... can't ask you in. </p>
            <p> Cora's pale smile. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              They're going to hang you. <br>
              (pause; soft)<br>
              Why didn't you leave when you had the chance? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Because what I am interested in is right here ... </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              What would you have me do? </p>
            <p> He touches her hand. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not. If they do not arrive, 
              the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father. 
              The French will protect the officer class among the English. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              No. I will find you. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Do not. <br>
              (pause)<br>
              Promise me. </p>
            <p> Cora drops her forehead to Hawkeye's hands wrapped around the 
              bars. She acquiesces, nods. Then HEAVY SHELLING commences. Cora 
              &amp; Hawkeye look up. Mortar bombs begin striking the fortress. 
              Still dark. The final French bombardment has started. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              The whole world's on fire, isn't it? </p>
            <p> A pause.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              This part of it sure is ... </p>
            <p> Reaching through the bars set in the thick door, their hands clasp 
              each others. On that image ... </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - VARIOUS CUTS - DAWN (2ND UNIT)</p>
            <p> French cannoneers in Batteries #1 and #2 fire again and again. 
              They work like precision drill teams. </p>
            <p> FRENCH TRENCH</p>
            <p> ending in Battery #3 is complete and surprisingly close to William 
              Henry's walls. Crews reload the squat and massive newly arrived 
              thirteen inch mortars. </p>
            <p> MORTAR ONE</p>
            <p> The flash-hole is primed. The burning fuse is jammed into the 
              bomb. The primer charge is lit off and the crew ducks as the crude 
              iron belches red flame and black smoke into the lightening sky. 
              The second mortar ROARS. Then a THIRD. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> INTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - ENGLISH CANNON CREW - NIGHT</p>
            <p> tries to return fire but can't under the heavy French bombardment. 
              The French mortar bomb arcs in and EXPLODES smoke, flame and shrapnel, 
              wiping out most of the crew. The fortress is under the heaviest 
              attack we've seen. Wounded are in shock or terrorized. Another mortar 
              bomb arcs in and explodes part of a building and casement, starting 
              a fire.<br>
              Another lands in the grounds. People scatter. It doesn't explode. 
              One soldier dashes to rip out the fuse. As his hand is inches away 
              ... EXPLOSION. </p>

            <p> INTERIOR STOCKADE - HAWKEYE - DAWN - LATER</p>
            <p> protects Cora through the bars as she half sleeps through the 
              muffled roar. Then the thundering stops. Hawkeye seperates himself 
              from her and crosses to the window. </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FORT, MAIN GATE - HAWKEYES POV: CHEVALIER DE LEVIS</p>
            <p> bows deeply to Major Beams. A French honor guard of five men is 
              behind him. A white scarf is on his sword tip. The fresh destruction 
              of the fort is apparent. Debris smolders. </p>
            <p> INTERIOR FORT - STOCKADE - HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> crosses to an awakened Cora. He touches her face. He's desperate 
              to drill these next words into her brain. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              What is it? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay 
              among the officers. </p>
            <p> Cora looks up at Hawkeye. We feel forboding. O.S. are heard drums

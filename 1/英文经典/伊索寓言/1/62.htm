              <b>The Ass and His Purchaser</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A MAN wished to purchase an Ass, and agreed with its owner that</p>
            <p>he should try out the animal before he bought him. He took the</p>
            <p>Ass home and put him in the straw-yard with his other Asses, upon</p>
            <p>which the new animal left all the others and at once joined the 
              one</p>
            <p>that was most idle and the greatest eater of them all. </p>
            <p>Seeing this, the man put a halter on him and led him back to his</p>
            <p>owner. On being asked how, in so short a time, he could have</p>
            <p>made a trial of him, he answered, &quot;I do not need a trial; 
              I know</p>
            <p>that he will be just the same as the one he chose for his</p>
            <p>companion.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A man is known by the company he keeps. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Two Bags</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>EVERY MAN, according to an ancient legend, is born into the </p>
            <p>world with two bags suspended from his neck all bag in front full</p>
            <p> of his neighbors' faults, and a large bag behind filled with his 
              own</p>
            <p>faults. Hence it is that men are quick to see the faults of others, 
              and</p>
            <p> yet are often blind to their own failings. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Stag at the Pool</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A STAG overpowered by heat came to a spring to drink. Seeing</p>
            <p> his own shadow reflected in the water, he greatly admired the 
              size</p>
            <p>and variety of his horns, but felt angry with himself for having</p>
            <p>such slender and weak feet. While he was thus contemplating</p>
            <p>himself, a Lion appeared at the pool and crouched to spring upon</p>
            <p>him. The Stag immediately took to flight, and exerting his</p>
            <p>utmost speed, as long as the plain was smooth and open kept</p>
            <p>himself easily at a safe distance from the Lion. But entering a</p>
            <p>wood he became entangled by his horns, and the Lion quickly </p>
            <p>came up to him and caught him. When too late, he thus reproached</p>
            <p>himself: &quot;Woe is me! How I have deceived myself! These feet 
            </p>
            <p> which would have saved me I despised, and I gloried in these </p>
            <p>antlers which have proved my destruction.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>What is most truly valuable is often underrated. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A HALF-FAMISHED JACKDAW seated himself on a fig-tree, </p>
            <p>which had produced some fruit entirely out of season, and waited 
            </p>
            <p>in the hope that the figs would ripen. A Fox seeing him sitting 
              so </p>
            <p>long and learning the reason of his doing so, said to him, &quot;You 
              are</p>
            <p>indeed, sir, sadly deceiving yourself; you are indulging a hope</p>
            <p>strong enough to cheat you, but which will never reward you with</p>

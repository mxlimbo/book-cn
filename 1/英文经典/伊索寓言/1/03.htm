              <b>The Kingdom of the Lion</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>THE BEASTS of the field and forest had a Lion as their king. He</p>
            <p>was neither wrathful, cruel, nor tyrannical, but just and gentle 
              as a </p>
            <p>king could be. During his reign he made a royal proclamation for 
              a </p>
            <p>general assembly of all the birds and beasts, and drew up onditions</p>
            <p> for a universal league, in which the Wolf and the Lamb, the Panther</p>
            <p> and the Kid, the Tiger and the Stag, the Dog and the Hare, should</p>
            <p> live together in perfect peace and amity. The Hare said, &quot;Oh, 
              how I</p>
            <p> have longed to see this day, in which the weak shall take their 
              place</p>
            <p> with impunity by the side of the strong.&quot; And after the Hare 
              said </p>
            <p>this, he ran for his life. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Wolf and the Crane</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A WOLF who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane, for a</p>
            <p>large sum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. 
            </p>
            <p>When the Crane had extracted the bone and demanded the romised</p>
            <p>payment, the Wolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed:</p>
            <p>&quot;Why, you have surely already had a sufficient recompense, 
              in</p>
            <p>having been permitted to draw out your head in safety from the</p>
            <p>mouth and jaws of a wolf.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>In serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you</p>
            <p>escape injury for your pains. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Fisherman Piping</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A FISHERMAN skilled in music took his flute and his nets to the</p>
            <p>seashore. Standing on a projecting rock, he played several tunes</p>
            <p>in the hope that the fish, attracted by his melody, would of</p>
            <p>their own accord dance into his net, which he had placed below. 
            </p>
            <p>At last, having long waited in vain, he laid aside his flute, and</p>
            <p>casting his net into the sea, made an excellent haul of fish. </p>
            <p>When he saw them leaping about in the net upon the rock he said:</p>
            <p>&quot;O you most perverse creatures, when I piped you would not 
            </p>
            <p> dance,but now that I have ceased you do so merrily.&quot; </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A CARTER was driving a wagon along a country lane, when the</p>
            <p>wheels sank down deep into a rut. The rustic driver, stupefied</p>
            <p>and aghast, stood looking at the wagon, and did nothing but utter</p>
            <p>loud cries to Hercules to come and help him. Hercules, it is said, 
            </p>
            <p> appeared and thus addressed him: &quot;Put your shoulders to the 
            </p>
            <p> wheels, my man. Goad on your bullocks, and never more pray to 
            </p>
            <p> me for help, until you have done your best to help yourself, or</p>
            <p>depend upon it you will henceforth pray in vain.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Self-help is the best help. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>THE ANTS were spending a fine winter's day drying grain ollected</p>
            <p>in the summertime. A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed</p>
            <p>by and earnestly begged for a little food. The Ants inquired of</p>
            <p>him, &quot;Why did you not treasure up food during the summer?' 
              He</p>
            <p>replied, &quot;I had not leisure enough. I passed the days in singing.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> They then said in derision: &quot;If you were foolish enough to 
              sing all </p>
            <p>the summer, you must dance supperless to bed in the winter.&quot;

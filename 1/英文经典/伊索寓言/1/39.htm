              <b>The Lion, the Fox, and the Ass</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>THE LION, the Fox and the Ass entered into an agreement to </p>
            <p>assist each other in the chase. Having secured a large booty, the 
            </p>
            <p> Lion on their return from the forest asked the Ass to allot his 
              due</p>
            <p>portion to each of the three partners in the treaty. The Ass</p>
            <p>carefully divided the spoil into three equal shares and modestly</p>
            <p>requested the two others to make the first choice. The Lion,</p>
            <p>bursting out into a great rage, devoured the Ass. Then he</p>
            <p>requested the Fox to do him the favor to make a division. The</p>
            <p>Fox accumulated all that they had killed into one large heap and</p>
            <p>left to himself the smallest possible morsel. The Lion said,</p>
            <p>&quot;Who has taught you, my very excellent fellow, the art of 
              division?</p>
            <p> You are perfect to a fraction.&quot; He replied, &quot;I learned 
              it from the </p>
            <p>Ass, by witnessing his fate.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Happy is the man who learns from the misfortunes of others. </p>

            <p>The Bull, the Lioness, and the Wild-Boar Hunter A BULL finding 
              a</p>
            <p> lion's cub asleep gored him to death with his horns. The Lioness 
            </p>
            <p> came up, and bitterly lamented the death of her whelp. A wild-boar</p>
            <p> Hunter, seeing her distress, stood at a distance and said to her, 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Think how many men there are who have reason to lament the 
            </p>
            <p> loss of their children, whose deaths have been caused by you.&quot;

            <p> </p>
            <p>THE WOODCUTTER cut down a Mountain Oak and split it in </p>
            <p>pieces,making wedges of its own branches for dividing the trunk. 
            </p>
            <p> The Oak said with a sigh, &quot;I do not care about the blows 
              of the axe</p>
            <p>aimed at my roots, but I do grieve at being torn in pieces by</p>
            <p>these wedges made from my own branches.&quot; </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A COTTAGER and his wife had a Hen that laid a golden egg </p>
            <p>every day. They supposed that the Hen must contain a great lump</p>
            <p> of gold in its inside, and in order to get the gold they killed 
              it. </p>
            <p>Having done so, they found to their surprise that the Hen</p>
            <p>differed in no respect from their other hens. The foolish pair,</p>
            <p>thus hoping to become rich all at once, deprived themselves of</p>
            <p>the gain of which they were assured day by day. </p>

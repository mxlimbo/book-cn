              <b>The Cobbler Turned Doctor</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A COBBLER unable to make a living by his trade and made </p>
            <p>desperate by poverty, began to practice medicine in a town in </p>
            <p>which he was not known. He sold a drug, pretending that it was 
              an</p>
            <p> antidote to all poisons, and obtained a great name for himself 
              by </p>
            <p>long-winded puffs and advertisements. When the Cobbler </p>
            <p>happened to fall sick himself of a serious illness, the Governor 
              of </p>
            <p>the town determined to test his skill. For this purpose he called 
              for</p>
            <p> a cup, and while filling it with water, pretended to mix poison 
              with </p>
            <p>the Cobbler's antidote, commanding him to drink it on the promise</p>
            <p> of a reward. The Cobbler, under the fear of death, confessed that</p>
            <p>he had no knowledge of medicine, and was only made famous by </p>
            <p>the stupid clamors of the crowd. The Governor then called a </p>
            <p>public assembly and addressed the citizens: &quot;Of what folly 
              have </p>
            <p>you been guilty? You have not hesitated to entrust your heads to 
              a</p>
            <p> man, whom no one could employ to make even the shoes for their</p>
            <p> feet.&quot;</p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A WOLF coming out of a field of oats met a Horse and thus</p>
            <p>addressed him: &quot;I would advise you to go into that field. 
              It is</p>
            <p>full of fine oats, which I have left untouched for you, as you</p>
            <p>are a friend whom I would love to hear enjoying good eating.&quot; 
              The</p>
            <p>Horse replied, &quot;If oats had been the food of wolves, you would</p>
            <p>never have indulged your ears at the cost of your belly.&quot;

            <p> </p>
            <p>A FATHER had one son and one daughter, the former remarkable </p>
            <p>for his good looks, the latter for her extraordinary ugliness. 
              While</p>
            <p>they were playing one day as children, they happened by chance 
              to</p>
            <p>look together into a mirror that was placed on their mother's</p>
            <p>chair. The boy congratulated himself on his good looks; the girl</p>
            <p>grew angry, and could not bear the self-praises of her Brother,</p>
            <p>interpreting all he said (and how could she do otherwise?) into</p>
            <p>reflection on herself. She ran off to her father. to be avenged</p>
            <p>on her Brother, and spitefully accused him of having, as a boy,</p>
            <p>made use of that which belonged only to girls. The father</p>
            <p>embraced them both, and bestowing his kisses and affection</p>
            <p>impartially on each, said, &quot;I wish you both would look into 
              the</p>
            <p>mirror every day: you, my son, that you may not spoil your beauty</p>
            <p>by evil conduct; and you, my daughter, that you may make up for</p>
            <p>your lack of beauty by your virtues.&quot; </p>

            <p>THE WASPS and the Partridges, overcome with thirst, came to a</p>
            <p>Farmer and besought him to give them some water to drink. They</p>
            <p>promised amply to repay him the favor which they asked. The</p>
            <p>Partridges declared that they would dig around his vines and make</p>
            <p>them produce finer grapes. The Wasps said that they would keep</p>
            <p>guard and drive off thieves with their stings. But the Farmer</p>
            <p>interrupted them, saying: &quot;I have already two oxen, who, without</p>
            <p>making any promises, do all these things. It is surely better</p>
            <p>for me to give the water to them than to you.&quot; </p>

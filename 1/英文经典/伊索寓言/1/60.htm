              <b>The Goods and the Ills</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>ALL the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that ommon</p>
            <p>share which they each had in the affairs of mankind; for the Ills 
              by </p>
            <p>reason of their numbers had prevailed to possess the earth. </p>
            <p>The Goods wafted themselves to heaven and asked for a righteous</p>
            <p>vengeance on their persecutors. They entreated Jupiter that they</p>
            <p>might no longer be associated with the Ills, as they had nothing</p>
            <p>in common and could not live together, but were engaged in</p>
            <p>unceasing warfare; and that an indissoluble law might be laid</p>
            <p>down for their future protection. Jupiter granted their request</p>
            <p>and decreed that henceforth the Ills should visit the earth in</p>
            <p>company with each other, but that the Goods should one by one</p>
            <p>enter the habitations of men. Hence it arises that Ills abound,</p>
            <p>for they come not one by one, but in troops, and by no means</p>
            <p>singly: while the Goods proceed from Jupiter, and are given, not</p>
            <p>alike to all, but singly, and separately; and one by one to those</p>
            <p>who are able to discern them. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Dove and the Crow</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A DOVE shut up in a cage was boasting of the large number of</p>
            <p>young ones which she had hatched. A Crow hearing her, said: &quot;My</p>
            <p>good friend, cease from this unseasonable boasting. The larger</p>
            <p>the number of your family, the greater your cause of sorrow, in</p>
            <p>seeing them shut up in this prison-house.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>Mercury and the Workmen</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A WORKMAN, felling wood by the side of a river, let his axe </p>
            <p>drop - by accident into a deep pool. Being thus deprived of the 
            </p>
            <p> means of his livelihood, he sat down on the bank and lamented 
              his </p>
            <p>hard fate. Mercury appeared and demanded the cause of his tears. 
            </p>
            <p>After he told him his misfortune, Mercury plunged into the stream,</p>
            <p> and, bringing up a golden axe, inquired if that were the one he 
              had </p>
            <p>lost. On his saying that it was not his, Mercury disappeared </p>
            <p>beneath the water a second time, returned with a silver axe in 
              his </p>
            <p>hand, and again asked the Workman if it were his. When the </p>
            <p>Workman said it was not, he dived into the pool for the third time 
            </p>
            <p>and brought up the axe that had been lost. </p>
            <p>The Workman claimed it and expressed his joy at its recovery. </p>
            <p>Mercury, pleased with his honesty, gave him the golden and silver</p>
            <p>axes in addition to his own. The Workman, on his return to his</p>
            <p>house, related to his companions all that had happened. One of</p>
            <p>them at once resolved to try and secure the same good fortune for</p>
            <p>himself. He ran to the river and threw his axe on purpose into</p>
            <p>the pool at the same place, and sat down on the bank to weep. </p>
            <p>Mercury appeared to him just as he hoped he would; and having</p>
            <p>learned the cause of his grief, plunged into the stream and</p>
            <p>brought up a golden axe, inquiring if he had lost it. The</p>
            <p>Workman seized it greedily, and declared that truly it was the</p>
            <p>very same axe that he had lost. Mercury, displeased at his</p>
            <p>knavery, not only took away the golden axe, but refused to</p>
            <p>recover for him the axe he had thrown into the pool. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Eagle and the Jackdaw</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>AN EAGLE, flying down from his perch on a lofty rock, seized </p>
            <p>upon a lamb and carried him aloft in his talons. A Jackdaw, who</p>
            <p>witnessed the capture of the lamb, was stirred with envy and</p>
            <p>determined to emulate the strength and flight of the Eagle. He</p>
            <p>flew around with a great whir of his wings and settled upon a</p>
            <p>large ram, with the intention of carrying him off, but his claws</p>
            <p>became entangled in the ram's fleece and he was not able to</p>
            <p>release himself, although he fluttered with his feathers as much</p>
            <p>as he could. The shepherd, seeing what had happened, ran up and</p>
            <p>caught him. He at once clipped the Jackdaw's wings, and taking</p>
            <p>him home at night, gave him to his children. On their saying,</p>
            <p>&quot;Father, what kind of bird is it?' he replied, &quot;To my 
              certain</p>
            <p>knowledge he is a Daw; but he would like you to think an Eagle.&quot;</p>

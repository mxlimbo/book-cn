              <b>The Fox and the Monkey</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A FOX and a Monkey were traveling together on the same road.</p>
            <p> As they journeyed, they passed through a cemetery full of </p>
            <p>monuments. </p>
            <p>&quot;All these monuments which you see,&quot; said the Monkey, 
              &quot;are</p>
            <p><br>
              in honor of my ancestors, who were in their day freedmen and </p>
            <p>citizens of great renown.&quot; The Fox replied, &quot;You have 
              chosen</p>
            <p>a most appropriate subject for your falsehoods, as I am sure none</p>
            <p>of your ancestors will be able to contradict you.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A false tale often betrays itself. </p>
            <p align="center"> </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Thief and the Housedog</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A THIEF came in the night to break into a house. He brought with</p>
            <p>him several slices of meat in order to pacify the Housedog, so</p>
            <p>that he would not alarm his master by barking. As the Thief</p>
            <p>threw him the pieces of meat, the Dog said, &quot;If you think 
              to stop</p>
            <p>my mouth, you will be greatly mistaken. This sudden kindness at</p>
            <p>your hands will only make me more watchful, lest under these</p>
            <p>unexpected favors to myself, you have some private ends to</p>
            <p>accomplish for your own benefit, and for my master's injury.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The Man, the Horse, the Ox, and the Dog </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A HORSE, Ox, and Dog, driven to great straits by the cold, </p>
            <p>sought shelter and protection from Man. He received them kindly,</p>
            <p>lighted a fire, and warmed them. He let the Horse make free with</p>
            <p>his oats, gave the Ox an abundance of hay, and fed the Dog with</p>
            <p>meat from his own table. Grateful for these favors, the animals</p>
            <p>determined to repay him to the best of their ability. For this</p>
            <p>purpose, they divided the term of his life between them, and each</p>
            <p>endowed one portion of it with the qualities which chiefly</p>
            <p>characterized himself. The Horse chose his earliest years and</p>
            <p>gave them his own attributes: hence every man is in his youth</p>
            <p>impetuous, headstrong, and obstinate in maintaining his own</p>
            <p>opinion. The Ox took under his patronage the next term of life,</p>
            <p>and therefore man in his middle age is fond of work, devoted to</p>
            <p>labor, and resolute to amass wealth and to husband his resources. 
            </p>
            <p>The end of life was reserved for the Dog, wherefore the old man</p>
            <p>is often snappish, irritable, hard to please, and selfish,</p>
            <p>tolerant only of his own household, but averse to strangers and</p>
            <p>to all who do not administer to his comfort or to his</p>
            <p>necessities. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Apes and the Two Travelers</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>TWO MEN, one who always spoke the truth and the other who </p>
            <p>told nothing but lies, were traveling together and by chance came 
            </p>
            <p> to the land of Apes. One of the Apes, who had raised himself to 
              be</p>
            <p>king, commanded them to be seized and brought before him, that 
            </p>
            <p> he might know what was said of him among men. He ordered at </p>
            <p>the same time that all the Apes be arranged in a long row on his</p>
            <p>right hand and on his left, and that a throne be placed for him,</p>
            <p>as was the custom among men. After these preparations he</p>
            <p>signified that the two men should be brought before him, and</p>
            <p>greeted them with this salutation: &quot;What sort of a king do 
              I seem</p>
            <p>to you to be, O strangers?' The Lying Traveler replied, &quot;You 
              seem</p>
            <p>to me a most mighty king.&quot; &quot;And what is your estimate 
              of those</p>
            <p>you see around me?' &quot;These,&quot; he made answer, &quot;are 
              worthy</p>
            <p>companions of yourself, fit at least to be ambassadors and</p>
            <p>leaders of armies.&quot; The Ape and all his court, gratified with 
              the</p>
            <p>lie, commanded that a handsome present be given to the flatterer. 
            </p>
            <p>On this the truthful Traveler thought to himself, &quot;If so great 
              a</p>
            <p>reward be given for a lie, with what gift may not I be rewarded,</p>
            <p>if, according to my custom, I tell the truth?' The Ape quickly</p>
            <p>turned to him. &quot;And pray how do I and these my friends around</p>
            <p> me seem to you?' &quot;Thou art,&quot; he said, &quot;a most excellent 
              Ape, and </p>
            <p>all these thy companions after thy example are excellent Apes too.&quot;</p>
            <p>The King of the Apes, enraged at hearing these truths, gave him</p>
            <p>over to the teeth and claws of his companions.</p>

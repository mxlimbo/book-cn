              <b>The Birds, the Beasts, and the Bat</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>THE BIRDS waged war with the Beasts, and each were by turns </p>
            <p>the conquerors. A Bat, fearing the uncertain issues of the fight,</p>
            <p>always fought on the side which he felt was the strongest. When</p>
            <p>peace was proclaimed, his deceitful conduct was apparent to both</p>
            <p>combatants. Therefore being condemned by each for his treachery,</p>
            <p>he was driven forth from the light of day, and henceforth</p>
            <p>concealed himself in dark hiding-places, flying always alone and</p>
            <p>at night. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Spendthrift and the Swallow</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A YOUNG MAN, a great spendthrift, had run through all his</p>
            <p>patrimony and had but one good cloak left. One day he happened</p>
            <p>to see a Swallow, which had appeared before its season, skimming</p>
            <p>along a pool and twittering gaily. He supposed that summer had</p>
            <p>come, and went and sold his cloak. Not many days later, winter</p>
            <p>set in again with renewed frost and cold. When he found the</p>
            <p>unfortunate Swallow lifeless on the ground, he said, &quot;Unhappy</p>
            <p>bird! what have you done? By thus appearing before the springtime</p>
            <p>you have not only killed yourself, but you have wrought my</p>
            <p>destruction also.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Fox and the Lion</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A FOX saw a Lion confined in a cage, and standing near him,</p>
            <p>bitterly reviled him. The Lion said to the Fox, &quot;It is not 
              thou</p>
            <p>who revilest me; but this mischance which has befallen me.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The Owl and the Birds AN OWL, in her wisdom, counseled the </p>
            <p>Birds that when the acorn first began to sprout, to pull it all 
              up out</p>
            <p>of the ground and not allow it to grow. She said acorns would </p>
            <p>produce mistletoe, from which an irremediable poison, the bird- 
            </p>
            <p>lime, would be extracted and by which they would be captured. </p>
            <p>The Owl next advised them to pluck up the seed of the flax, which</p>
            <p>men had sown, as it was a plant which boded no good to them. </p>
            <p>And, lastly, the Owl, seeing an archer approach, predicted that</p>
            <p>this man, being on foot, would contrive darts armed with feathers</p>
            <p>which would fly faster than the wings of the Birds themselves. 
            </p>
            <p>The Birds gave no credence to these warning words, but onsidered</p>
            <p>the Owl to be beside herself and said that she was mad. But</p>
            <p>afterwards, finding her words were true, they wondered at her</p>
            <p>knowledge and deemed her to be the wisest of birds. Hence it is</p>
            <p>that when she appears they look to her as knowing all things,</p>
            <p>while she no longer gives them advice, but in solitude laments</p>
            <p>their past folly. </p>

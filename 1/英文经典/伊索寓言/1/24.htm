              <b>The Two Dogs</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A MAN had two dogs: a Hound, trained to assist him in his sports,</p>
            <p>and a Housedog, taught to watch the house. When he returned </p>
            <p>home after a good day's sport, he always gave the Housedog a </p>
            <p>large share of his spoil. The Hound, feeling much aggrieved at 
              this,</p>
            <p>reproached his companion, saying, &quot;It is very hard to have 
              all</p>
            <p>this labor, while you, who do not assist in the chase, luxuriate</p>
            <p>on the fruits of my exertions.&quot; The Housedog replied, &quot;Do 
              not</p>
            <p>blame me, my friend, but find fault with the master, who has not</p>
            <p>taught me to labor, but to depend for subsistence on the labor 
              of</p>
            <p>others.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Children are not to be blamed for the faults of their parents.

            <p align="center"><b>The Stag in the Ox-Stall</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A STAG, roundly chased by the hounds and blinded by fear to the</p>
            <p>danger he was running into, took shelter in a farmyard and hid</p>
            <p>himself in a shed among the oxen. An Ox gave him this kindly</p>
            <p>warning: &quot;O unhappy creature! why should you thus, of your 
              own</p>
            <p>accord, incur destruction and trust yourself in the house of your</p>
            <p>enemy?' The Stag replied: &quot;Only allow me, friend, to stay 
              where I</p>
            <p>am, and I will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of</p>
            <p>effecting my escape.&quot; At the approach of the evening the herdsman</p>
            <p>came to feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag; and even the</p>
            <p>farm-bailiff with several laborers passed through the shed and</p>
            <p>failed to notice him. The Stag, congratulating himself on his</p>
            <p>safety, began to express his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had</p>
            <p>kindly helped him in the hour of need. One of them again</p>
            <p>answered him: &quot;We indeed wish you well, but the danger is 
              not</p>
            <p>over. There is one other yet to pass through the shed, who has</p>
            <p>as it were a hundred eyes, and until he has come and gone, your</p>
            <p>life is still in peril.&quot; At that moment the master himself</p>
            <p>entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had not been</p>
            <p>properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out: &quot;Why 
              is</p>
            <p>there such a scarcity of fodder? There is not half enough straw</p>
            <p>for them to lie on. Those lazy fellows have not even swept the</p>
            <p>cobwebs away.&quot; While he thus examined everything in turn, 
              he</p>
            <p>spied the tips of the antlers of the Stag peeping out of the</p>
            <p>straw. Then summoning his laborers, he ordered that the Stag</p>
            <p>should be seized and killed. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Hawk, the Kite, and the Pigeons</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>THE PIGEONS, terrified by the appearance of a Kite, called upon</p>
            <p>the Hawk to defend them. He at once consented. When they had</p>
            <p>admitted him into the cote, they found that he made more havoc</p>
            <p>and slew a larger number of them in one day than the Kite could</p>
            <p>pounce upon in a whole year. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Avoid a remedy that is worse than the disease. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Widow and the Sheep</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A CERTAIN poor widow had one solitary Sheep. At shearing </p>
            <p>time,wishing to take his fleece and to avoid expense, she sheared 
            </p>
            <p> him herself, but used the shears so unskillfully that with the 
              fleece</p>
            <p>she sheared the flesh. The Sheep, writhing with pain, said, &quot;Why</p>
            <p>do you hurt me so, Mistress? What weight can my blood add to </p>
            <p>the wool? If you want my flesh, there is the butcher, who will 
              kill</p>
            <p>me in an instant; but if you want my fleece and wool, there is</p>
            <p>the shearer, who will shear and not hurt me.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The least outlay is not always the greatest gain. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Wild Ass and the Lion</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A WILD ASS and a Lion entered into an alliance so that they might</p>
            <p>capture the beasts of the forest with greater ease. The Lion agreed</p>
            <p> to assist the Wild Ass with his strength, while the Wild Ass gave 
            </p>
            <p> the Lion the benefit of his greater speed. When they had taken 
              as </p>
            <p>many beasts as their necessities required, the Lion undertook to 
            </p>
            <p> distribute the prey, and for this purpose divided it into three 
              shares.</p>
            <p> &quot;I will take the first share,&quot; he said, &quot;because 
              I am King: and the </p>
            <p>second share, as a partner with you in the chase: and the third 
            </p>
            <p> share (believe me) will be a source of great evil to you, unless 
              you </p>
            <p>willingly resign it to me, and set off as fast as you can.&quot;

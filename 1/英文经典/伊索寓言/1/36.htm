              <b>The Lion and the Hare </b></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A LION came across a Hare, who was fast asleep. He was just in</p>
            <p>the act of seizing her, when a fine young Hart trotted by, and 
              he</p>
            <p>left the Hare to follow him. The Hare, scared by the noise,</p>
            <p>awoke and scudded away. The Lion was unable after a long chase</p>
            <p>to catch the Hart, and returned to feed upon the Hare. On</p>
            <p>finding that the Hare also had run off, he said, &quot;I am rightly</p>
            <p>served, for having let go of the food that I had in my hand for</p>
            <p>the chance of obtaining more.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Peasant and the Eagle</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A PEASANT found an Eagle captured in a trap, and much dmiring</p>
            <p>the bird, set him free. The Eagle did not prove ungrateful to</p>
            <p>his deliverer, for seeing the Peasant sitting under a wall which</p>
            <p>was not safe, he flew toward him and with his talons snatched a</p>
            <p>bundle from his head. When the Peasant rose in pursuit, the</p>
            <p>Eagle let the bundle fall again. Taking it up, the man returned</p>
            <p>to the same place, to find that the wall under which he had been</p>
            <p>sitting had fallen to pieces; and he marveled at the service</p>
            <p>rendered him by the Eagle. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Image of Mercury and the Carpenter</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A VERY POOR MAN, a Carpenter by trade, had a wooden image</p>
            <p> of Mercury, before which he made offerings day by day, and </p>
            <p>begged the idol to make him rich, but in spite of his entreaties 
              he</p>
            <p>became poorer and poorer. At last, being very angry, he took his</p>
            <p>image down from its pedestal and dashed it against the wall. </p>
            <p>When its head was knocked off, out came a stream of gold, which</p>
            <p>the Carpenter quickly picked up and said, &quot;Well, I think thou 
              art</p>
            <p>altogether contradictory and unreasonable; for when I paid you</p>
            <p>honor, I reaped no benefits: but now that I maltreat you I am</p>
            <p>loaded with an abundance of riches.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Bull and the Goat</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A BULL, escaping from a Lion, hid in a cave which some </p>
            <p>shepherds had recently occupied. As soon as he entered, a He-</p>
            <p>Goat left in the cave sharply attacked him with his horns. The 
              Bull</p>
            <p> quietly addressed him: &quot;Butt away as much as you will. I 
              have no </p>
            <p>fear of you, but of the Lion. Let that monster go away and I will 
            </p>
            <p> soon let you know what is the respective strength of a Goat and 
              a</p>
            <p>Bull.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>It shows an evil disposition to take advantage of a friend in </p>
            <p>distress.</p>

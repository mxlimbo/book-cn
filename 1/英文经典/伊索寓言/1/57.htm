              <b>The Quack Frog</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A FROG once upon a time came forth from his home in the marsh</p>
            <p> and proclaimed to all the beasts that he was a learned physician,</p>
            <p>skilled in the use of drugs and able to heal all diseases. A Fox</p>
            <p>asked him, &quot;How can you pretend to prescribe for others, when</p>
            <p> you are unable to heal your own lame gait and wrinkled skin?' 
            </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Lion, the Wolf, and the Fox</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A LION, growing old, lay sick in his cave. All the beasts came</p>
            <p>to visit their king, except the Fox. The Wolf therefore, thinking 
              that</p>
            <p> he had a capital opportunity, accused the Fox to the Lion of not 
            </p>
            <p> paying any respect to him who had the rule over them all and of 
            </p>
            <p> not coming to visit him. At that very moment the Fox came in and 
            </p>
            <p> heard these last words of the Wolf. The Lion roaring out in a 
              rage </p>
            <p>against him, the Fox sought an opportunity to defend himself and 
            </p>
            <p> said, &quot;And who of all those who have come to you have benefited 
            </p>
            <p>you so much as I, who have traveled from place to place in every 
            </p>
            <p> direction, and have sought and learnt from the physicians the 
            </p>
            <p> means of healing you?' The Lion commanded him immediately to </p>
            <p>tell him the cure, when he replied, &quot;You must flay a wolf 
              alive and </p>
            <p>wrap his skin yet warm around you.&quot; The Wolf was at once taken 
            </p>
            <p>and flayed; whereon the Fox, turning to him, said with a smile, 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;You should have moved your master not to ill, but to good, 
              will.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Dog's House </b></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>IN THE WINTERTIME, a Dog curled up in as small a space as</p>
            <p>possible on account of the cold, determined to make himself a</p>
            <p>house. However when the summer returned again, he lay asleep</p>
            <p>stretched at his full length and appeared to himself to be of a</p>
            <p>great size. Now he considered that it would be neither an easy</p>
            <p>nor a necessary work to make himself such a house as would</p>
            <p>accommodate him. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>ROAMING BY the mountainside at sundown, a Wolf saw his own</p>
            <p> shadow become greatly extended and magnified, and he said to </p>
            <p>himself, &quot;Why should I, being of such an immense size and 
            </p>
            <p> extending nearly an acre in length, be afraid of the Lion? Ought 
              I </p>
            <p>not to be acknowledged as King of all the collected beasts?' While</p>
            <p>he was indulging in these proud thoughts, a Lion fell upon him 
              and</p>
            <p>killed him. He exclaimed with a too late repentance, &quot;Wretched</p>
            <p>me! this overestimation of myself is the cause of my destruction.&quot;

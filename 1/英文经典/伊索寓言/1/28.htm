              <b>The Master and His Dogs</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A CERTAIN MAN, detained by a storm in his country house, first</p>
            <p> of all killed his sheep, and then his goats, for the maintenance 
              of</p>
            <p>his household. The storm still continuing, he was obliged to</p>
            <p>slaughter his yoke oxen for food. On seeing this, his Dogs took</p>
            <p>counsel together, and said, &quot;It is time for us to be off, 
              for if</p>
            <p>the master spare not his oxen, who work for his gain, how can we</p>
            <p>expect him to spare us?' </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>He is not to be trusted as a friend who mistreats his own family.

            <p> </p>
            <p>A WOLF, passing by, saw some Shepherds in a hut eating a </p>
            <p>haunch of mutton for their dinner. Approaching them, he said, </p>
            <p>&quot;What a clamor you would raise if I were to do as you are 
              doing!&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The Dolphins, the Whales, and the Sprat THE DOLPHINS and </p>
            <p>Whales waged a fierce war with each other. When the battle was 
              at</p>
            <p> its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves and said 
              that he </p>
            <p>would reconcile their differences if they would accept him as an 
            </p>
            <p> umpire. One of the Dolphins replied, &quot;We would far rather 
              be </p>
            <p>destroyed in our battle with each other than admit any interference 
            </p>
            <p>from you in our affairs.&quot; </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>AN ASS once carried through the streets of a city a famous </p>
            <p>wooden Image, to be placed in one of its Temples. As he passed 
            </p>
            <p> along, the crowd made lowly prostration before the Image. The 
            </p>
            <p> Ass, thinking that they bowed their heads in token of respect 
              for</p>
            <p>himself, bristled up with pride, gave himself airs, and refused</p>
            <p>to move another step. The driver, seeing him thus stop, laid his</p>
            <p>whip lustily about his shoulders and said, &quot;O you perverse</p>
            <p>dull-head! it is not yet come to this, that men pay worship to 
              an</p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>TWO MEN were journeying together. One of them picked up an </p>
            <p>axe that lay upon the path, and said, &quot;I have found an axe.&quot; 
              &quot;Nay, </p>
            <p>my friend,&quot; replied the other, &quot;do not say 'I,' but 'We' 
              have found</p>
            <p>an axe.&quot; They had not gone far before they saw the owner of 
              the</p>
            <p>axe pursuing them, and he who had picked up the axe said, &quot;We 
            </p>
            <p> are undone.&quot; &quot;Nay,&quot; replied the other, &quot;keep 
              to your first mode of</p>
            <p>speech, my friend; what you thought right then, think right now.

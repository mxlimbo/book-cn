              <b>The Fox and the Monkey</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A MONKEY once danced in an assembly of the Beasts, and so </p>
            <p>pleased them all by his performance that they elected him their 
            </p>
            <p> King. A Fox, envying him the honor, discovered a piece of meat 
            </p>
            <p> lying in a trap, and leading the Monkey to the place where it 
              was, </p>
            <p>said that she had found a store, but had not used it, she had kept 
              it</p>
            <p> for him as treasure trove of his kingdom, and counseled him to 
              lay</p>
            <p> hold of it. The Monkey approached carelessly and was caught in 
            </p>
            <p> the trap; and on his accusing the Fox of purposely leading him 
              into</p>
            <p>the snare, she replied, &quot;O Monkey, and are you, with such 
              a mind</p>
            <p>as yours, going to be King over the Beasts?&quot;</p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Horse and His Rider</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A HORSE SOLDIER took the utmost pains with his charger. As</p>
            <p> long as the war lasted, he looked upon him as his fellow-helper 
              in </p>
            <p>all emergencies and fed him carefully with hay and corn. But when</p>
            <p>the war was over, he only allowed him chaff to eat and made him</p>
            <p>carry heavy loads of wood, subjecting him to much slavish</p>
            <p>drudgery and ill-treatment. War was again proclaimed, however,</p>
            <p>and when the trumpet summoned him to his standard, the Soldier</p>
            <p>put on his charger its military trappings, and mounted, being</p>
            <p>clad in his heavy coat of mail. The Horse fell down straightway</p>
            <p>under the weight, no longer equal to the burden, and said to his</p>
            <p>master, &quot;You must now go to the war on foot, for you have</p>
            <p>transformed me from a Horse into an Ass; and how can you </p>
            <p>expect that I can again turn in a moment from an Ass to a Horse?'

            <p align="center"><b>The Belly and the Members</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>THE MEMBERS of the Body rebelled against the Belly, and said,</p>
            <p>&quot;Why should we be perpetually engaged in administering to 
              your</p>
            <p>wants, while you do nothing but take your rest, and enjoy</p>
            <p>yourself in luxury and self-indulgence?' The Members carried out</p>
            <p>their resolve and refused their assistance to the Belly. The whole 
            </p>
            <p> Body quickly became debilitated, and the hands, feet, mouth, and 
            </p>
            <p> eyes, when too late, repented of their folly. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Vine and the Goat</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A VINE was luxuriant in the time of vintage with leaves and grapes.</p>
            <p> A Goat, passing by, nibbled its young tendrils and its leaves. 
              The </p>
            <p>Vine addressed him and said: &quot;Why do you thus injure me without</p>
            <p> a cause, and crop my leaves? Is there no young grass left? But 
              I </p>
            <p>shall not have to wait long for my just revenge; for if you now 
            </p>
            <p> should crop my leaves, and cut me down to my root, I shall rovide</p>
            <p> the wine to pour over you when you are led as a victim to the 
            </p>
            <p> sacrifice.&quot; </p>

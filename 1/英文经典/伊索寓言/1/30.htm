              <b>The Seaside Travelers</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>SOME TRAVELERS, journeying along the seashore, climbed to </p>
            <p>the summit of a tall cliff, and looking over the sea, saw in the</p>
            <p>distance what they thought was a large ship. They waited in the</p>
            <p>hope of seeing it enter the harbor, but as the object on which</p>
            <p>they looked was driven nearer to shore by the wind, they found</p>
            <p>that it could at the most be a small boat, and not a ship. When</p>
            <p>however it reached the beach, they discovered that it was only 
              a</p>
            <p>large faggot of sticks, and one of them said to his companions,</p>
            <p>&quot;We have waited for no purpose, for after all there is nothing 
              to</p>
            <p>see but a load of wood.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Our mere anticipations of life outrun its realities. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Brazier and His Dog</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A BRAZIER had a little Dog, which was a great favorite with his</p>
            <p>master, and his constant companion. While he hammered away at</p>
            <p>his metals the Dog slept; but when, on the other hand, he went 
              to</p>
            <p>dinner and began to eat, the Dog woke up and wagged his tail, as</p>
            <p>if he would ask for a share of his meal. His master one day,</p>
            <p>pretending to be angry and shaking his stick at him, said, &quot;You</p>
            <p>wretched little sluggard! what shall I do to you? While I am</p>
            <p>hammering on the anvil, you sleep on the mat; and when I begin 
              to</p>
            <p>eat after my toil, you wake up and wag your tail for food. Do</p>
            <p>you not know that labor is the source of every blessing, and that</p>
            <p>none but those who work are entitled to eat?' </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Ass and His Shadow</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A TRAVELER hired an Ass to convey him to a distant place. The</p>
            <p>day being intensely hot, and the sun shining in its strength, the</p>
            <p>Traveler stopped to rest, and sought shelter from the heat under</p>
            <p>the Shadow of the Ass. As this afforded only protection for one,</p>
            <p>and as the Traveler and the owner of the Ass both claimed it, a</p>
            <p>violent dispute arose between them as to which of them had the</p>
            <p>right to the Shadow. The owner maintained that he had let the</p>
            <p>Ass only, and not his Shadow. The Traveler asserted that he had,</p>
            <p>with the hire of the Ass, hired his Shadow also. The quarrel</p>
            <p>proceeded from words to blows, and while the men fought, the </p>
            <p>Ass galloped off. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>In quarreling about the shadow we often lose the substance. </p>
            <p align="center"> </p>
            <p align="center"></p>
            <p align="center"><b>The Ass and His Masters</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>AN ASS, belonging to an herb-seller who gave him too little food</p>
            <p>and too much work made a petition to Jupiter to be released from</p>
            <p>his present service and provided with another master. Jupiter,</p>
            <p>after warning him that he would repent his request, caused him 
              to</p>
            <p>be sold to a tile-maker. Shortly afterwards, finding that he had</p>
            <p>heavier loads to carry and harder work in the brick-field, he</p>
            <p>petitioned for another change of master. Jupiter, telling him</p>
            <p>that it would be the last time that he could grant his request,</p>
            <p>ordained that he be sold to a tanner. The Ass found that he had</p>
            <p>fallen into worse hands, and noting his master's occupation,</p>
            <p>said, groaning: &quot;It would have been better for me to have 
              been</p>
            <p>either starved by the one, or to have been overworked by the</p>
            <p>other of my former masters, than to have been bought by my</p>
            <p>present owner, who will even after I am dead tan my hide, and</p>
            <p>make me useful to him.&quot; </p>

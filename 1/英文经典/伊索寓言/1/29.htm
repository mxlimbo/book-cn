              <b>The Old Lion</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A LION, worn out with years and powerless from disease, lay on</p>
            <p>the ground at the point of death. A Boar rushed upon him, and</p>
            <p>avenged with a stroke of his tusks a long-remembered injury. </p>
            <p>Shortly afterwards the Bull with his horns gored him as if he</p>
            <p>were an enemy. When the Ass saw that the huge beast could be</p>
            <p>assailed with impunity, he let drive at his forehead with his</p>
            <p>heels. The expiring Lion said, &quot;I have reluctantly brooked 
              the</p>
            <p>insults of the brave, but to be compelled to endure such</p>
            <p>treatment from thee, a disgrace to Nature, is indeed to die a</p>
            <p>double death.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Old Hound</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A HOUND, who in the days of his youth and strength had never</p>
            <p>yielded to any beast of the forest, encountered in his old age 
              a</p>
            <p>boar in the chase. He seized him boldly by the ear, but could</p>
            <p>not retain his hold because of the decay of his teeth, so that</p>
            <p>the boar escaped. His master, quickly coming up, was very much</p>
            <p>disappointed, and fiercely abused the dog. The Hound looked up</p>
            <p>and said, &quot;It was not my fault. master: my spirit was as good 
              as</p>
            <p>ever, but I could not help my infirmities. I rather deserve to</p>
            <p>be praised for what I have been, than to be blamed for what I</p>
            <p>am.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Bee and Jupiter</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A BEE from Mount Hymettus, the queen of the hive, ascended to</p>
            <p>Olympus to present Jupiter some honey fresh from her combs. </p>
            <p>Jupiter, delighted with the offering of honey, promised to give</p>
            <p>whatever she should ask. She therefore besought him, saying,</p>
            <p>&quot;Give me, I pray thee, a sting, that if any mortal shall approach</p>
            <p>to take my honey, I may kill him.&quot; Jupiter was much displeased,</p>
            <p>for he loved the race of man, but could not refuse the request</p>
            <p>because of his promise. He thus answered the Bee: &quot;You shall</p>
            <p>have your request, but it will be at the peril of your own life. 
            </p>
            <p>For if you use your sting, it shall remain in the wound you make,</p>
            <p>and then you will die from the loss of it.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Evil wishes, like chickens, come home to roost. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Milk-Woman and Her Pail</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A FARMER'S daughter was carrying her Pail of milk from the field</p>
            <p>to the farmhouse, when she fell a-musing. &quot;The money for which</p>
            <p>this milk will be sold, will buy at least three hundred eggs. </p>
            <p>The eggs, allowing for all mishaps, will produce two hundred and</p>
            <p>fifty chickens. The chickens will become ready for the market</p>
            <p>when poultry will fetch the highest price, so that by the end of</p>
            <p>the year I shall have money enough from my share to buy a new</p>
            <p>gown. In this dress I will go to the Christmas parties, where</p>
            <p>all the young fellows will propose to me, but I will toss my head</p>
            <p>and refuse them every one.&quot; At this moment she tossed her 
              head in</p>
            <p>unison with her thoughts, when down fell the milk pail to the</p>
            <p>ground, and all her imaginary schemes perished in a moment.</p>

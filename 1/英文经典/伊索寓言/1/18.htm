              <b>Jupiter and the Monkey</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>JUPITER ISSUED a proclamation to all the beasts of the forest </p>
            <p>and promised a royal reward to the one whose offspring should be</p>
            <p>deemed the handsomest. The Monkey came with the rest and</p>
            <p>presented, with all a mother's tenderness, a flat-nosed, hairless, 
              ill-</p>
            <p>featured young Monkey as a candidate for the promised reward. A</p>
            <p> general laugh saluted her on the presentation of her son. She 
            </p>
            <p> resolutely said, &quot;I know not whether Jupiter will allot the 
              prize to </p>
            <p>my son, but this I do know, that he is at least in the eyes of 
              me his </p>
            <p>mother, the dearest, handsomest, and most beautiful of all.&quot;

            <p> </p>
            <p>A WIDOW who was fond of cleaning had two little maidens to </p>
            <p>wait on her. She was in the habit of waking them early in the</p>
            <p>morning, at cockcrow. The maidens, aggravated by such excessive</p>
            <p>labor, resolved to kill the cock who roused their mistress so</p>
            <p>early. When they had done this, they found that they had only</p>
            <p>prepared for themselves greater troubles, for their mistress, no</p>
            <p>longer hearing the hour from the cock, woke them up to their work</p>
            <p>in the middle of the night. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A SHEPHERD-BOY, who watched a flock of sheep near a village,</p>
            <p>brought out the villagers three or four times by crying out,</p>
            <p>&quot;Wolf! Wolf!&quot; and when his neighbors came to help him, 
              laughed</p>
            <p> at them for their pains. The Wolf, however, did truly come at 
              last. </p>
            <p>The Shepherd-boy, now really alarmed, shouted in an agony of</p>
            <p>terror: &quot;Pray, do come and help me; the Wolf is killing the</p>
            <p>sheep&quot;; but no one paid any heed to his cries, nor rendered 
              any</p>
            <p>assistance. The Wolf, having no cause of fear, at his leisure</p>
            <p>lacerated or destroyed the whole flock. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>There is no believing a liar, even when he speaks the truth. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A CAT, hearing that the Birds in a certain aviary were ailing</p>
            <p>dressed himself up as a physician, and, taking his cane and a bag</p>
            <p>of instruments becoming his profession, went to call on them. He</p>
            <p>knocked at the door and inquired of the inmates how they all did,</p>
            <p>saying that if they were ill, he would be happy to prescribe for</p>
            <p>them and cure them. They replied, &quot;We are all very well, and</p>
            <p>shall continue so, if you will only be good enough to go away,</p>
            <p>and leave us as we are.&quot; </p>

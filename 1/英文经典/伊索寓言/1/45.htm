              <b>The Hart and the Vine</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A HART, hard pressed in the chase, hid himself beneath the large</p>
            <p>leaves of a Vine. The huntsmen, in their haste, overshot the</p>
            <p>place of his concealment. Supposing all danger to have passed,</p>
            <p>the Hart began to nibble the tendrils of the Vine. One of the</p>
            <p>huntsmen, attracted by the rustling of the leaves, looked back,</p>
            <p>and seeing the Hart, shot an arrow from his bow and struck it. 
            </p>
            <p>The Hart, at the point of death, groaned: &quot;I am rightly served,</p>
            <p>for I should not have maltreated the Vine that saved me.&quot; 
            </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Serpent and the Eagle</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A SERPENT and an Eagle were struggling with each other in </p>
            <p>deadly conflict. The Serpent had the advantage, and was about to</p>
            <p>strangle the bird. A countryman saw them, and running up, loosed</p>
            <p>the coil of the Serpent and let the Eagle go free. The Serpent,</p>
            <p>irritated at the escape of his prey, injected his poison into the</p>
            <p>drinking horn of the countryman. The rustic, ignorant of his</p>
            <p>danger, was about to drink, when the Eagle struck his hand with</p>
            <p>his wing, and, seizing the drinking horn in his talons, carried</p>
            <p>it aloft. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Crow and the Pitcher</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A CROW perishing with thirst saw a pitcher, and hoping to find</p>
            <p>water, flew to it with delight. When he reached it, he</p>
            <p>discovered to his grief that it contained so little water that 
              he</p>
            <p>could not possibly get at it. He tried everything he could think</p>
            <p>of to reach the water, but all his efforts were in vain. At last</p>
            <p>he collected as many stones as he could carry and dropped them</p>
            <p>one by one with his beak into the pitcher, until he brought the</p>
            <p>water within his reach and thus saved his life. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Necessity is the mother of invention. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Two Frogs</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>TWO FROGS were neighbors. One inhabited a deep pond, far </p>
            <p>removed from public view; the other lived in a gully containing 
              little</p>
            <p>water, and traversed by a country road. The Frog that lived in</p>
            <p>the pond warned his friend to change his residence and entreated</p>
            <p>him to come and live with him, saying that he would enjoy greater</p>
            <p>safety from danger and more abundant food. The other refused,</p>
            <p>saying that he felt it so very hard to leave a place to which he</p>
            <p>had become accustomed. A few days afterwards a heavy wagon</p>
            <p>passed through the gully and crushed him to death under its</p>
            <p>wheels. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A willful man will have his way to his own hurt. </p>

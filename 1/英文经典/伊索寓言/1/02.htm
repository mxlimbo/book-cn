              <b>The Charcoal-Burner and the Fuller</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A CHARCOAL-BURNER carried on his trade in his own house. </p>
            <p>One day he met a friend, a Fuller, and entreated him to come and 
            </p>
            <p> live with him, saying that they should be far better neighbors 
              and</p>
            <p>that their housekeeping expenses would be lessened. The Fuller</p>
            <p>replied, &quot;The arrangement is impossible as far as I am concerned,</p>
            <p>for whatever I should whiten, you would immediately blacken again</p>
            <p>with your charcoal.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Like will draw like. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Father and His Sons</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A FATHER had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling</p>
            <p>among themselves. When he failed to heal their disputes by his</p>
            <p>exhortations, he determined to give them a practical illustration</p>
            <p>of the evils of disunion; and for this purpose he one day told</p>
            <p>them to bring him a bundle of sticks. When they had done so, he</p>
            <p>placed the faggot into the hands of each of them in succession,</p>
            <p>and ordered them to break it in pieces. They tried with all their 
            </p>
            <p> strength, and were not able to do it. He next opened the faggot, 
            </p>
            <p> took the sticks separately, one by one, and again put them into 
              his</p>
            <p> sons' hands, upon which they broke them easily. He then ddressed</p>
            <p> them in these words: &quot;My sons, if you are of one mind, and 
              unite </p>
            <p>to assist each other, you will be as this faggot, uninjured by 
              all the </p>
            <p>attempts of your enemies; but if you are divided among yourselves</p>
            <p>, you will be broken as easily as these sticks.&quot; </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A BOY was hunting for locusts. He had caught a goodly number,</p>
            <p>when he saw a Scorpion, and mistaking him for a locust, reached</p>
            <p>out his hand to take him. The Scorpion, showing his sting, said:</p>
            <p>If you had but touched me, my friend, you would have lost me, </p>
            <p>and all your locusts too!&quot; </p>

            <p>A COCK, scratching for food for himself and his hens, found a</p>
            <p>precious stone and exclaimed: &quot;If your owner had found thee, 
              and</p>
            <p>not I, he would have taken thee up, and have set thee in thy first 
            </p>
            <p> estate; but I have found thee for no purpose. I would rather have 
            </p>
            <p> one barleycorn than all the jewels in the world.&quot; </p>

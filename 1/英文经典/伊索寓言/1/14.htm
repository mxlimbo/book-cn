              <b>The Lion, the Mouse, and the Fox</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A LION, fatigued by the heat of a summer's day, fell fast asleep</p>
            <p>in his den. A Mouse ran over his mane and ears and woke him </p>
            <p>from his slumbers. He rose up and shook himself in great wrath, 
            </p>
            <p> and searched every corner of his den to find the Mouse. A Fox 
            </p>
            <p> seeing him said: &quot;A fine Lion you are, to be frightened of 
              a ouse.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;'Tis not the Mouse I fear,&quot; said the Lion; &quot;I resent 
              his familiarity </p>
            <p>and ill-breeding.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Little liberties are great offenses. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Vain Jackdaw</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>JUPITER DETERMINED, it is said, to create a sovereign over the</p>
            <p>birds, and made proclamation that on a certain day they should</p>
            <p>all present themselves before him, when he would himself choose</p>
            <p>the most beautiful among them to be king. The Jackdaw, knowing</p>
            <p>his own ugliness, searched through the woods and fields, and</p>
            <p>collected the feathers which had fallen from the wings of his</p>
            <p>companions, and stuck them in all parts of his body, hoping</p>
            <p>thereby to make himself the most beautiful of all. When the</p>
            <p>appointed day arrived, and the birds had assembled before</p>
            <p>Jupiter, the Jackdaw also made his appearance in his many</p>
            <p>feathered finery. But when Jupiter proposed to make him king</p>
            <p>because of the beauty of his plumage, the birds indignantly</p>
            <p>protested, and each plucked from him his own feathers, leaving</p>
            <p>the Jackdaw nothing but a Jackdaw. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Goatherd and the Wild Goats</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A GOATHERD, driving his flock from their pasture at eventide,</p>
            <p>found some Wild Goats mingled among them, and shut them up</p>
            <p>together with his own for the night. The next day it snowed very</p>
            <p>hard, so that he could not take the herd to their usual feeding</p>
            <p>places, but was obliged to keep them in the fold. He gave his</p>
            <p>own goats just sufficient food to keep them alive, but fed the</p>
            <p>strangers more abundantly in the hope of enticing them to stay</p>
            <p>with him and of making them his own. When the thaw set in, he</p>
            <p>led them all out to feed, and the Wild Goats scampered away as</p>
            <p>fast as they could to the mountains. The Goatherd scolded them</p>
            <p>for their ingratitude in leaving him, when during the storm he</p>
            <p>had taken more care of them than of his own herd. One of them,</p>
            <p>turning about, said to him: &quot;That is the very reason why we 
              are</p>
            <p>so cautious; for if you yesterday treated us better than the</p>
            <p>Goats you have had so long, it is plain also that if others came</p>
            <p>after us, you would in the same manner prefer them to ourselves.&quot;</p>
            <p></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Old friends cannot with impunity be sacrificed for new ones. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Mischievous Dog</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A DOG used to run up quietly to the heels of everyone he met, and</p>
            <p>to bite them without notice. His master suspended a bell about</p>
            <p>his neck so that the Dog might give notice of his presence</p>
            <p>wherever he went. Thinking it a mark of distinction, the Dog</p>
            <p>grew proud of his bell and went tinkling it all over the</p>
            <p>marketplace. One day an old hound said to him: Why do you make</p>
            <p>such an exhibition of yourself? That bell that you carry is not,</p>
            <p>believe me, any order of merit, but on the contrary a mark of</p>
            <p>disgrace, a public notice to all men to avoid you as an ill</p>
            <p>mannered dog.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Notoriety is often mistaken for fame.</p>

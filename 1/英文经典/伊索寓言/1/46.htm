              The Wolf and the Fox</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>AT ONE TIME a very large and strong Wolf was born among the</p>
            <p>wolves, who exceeded all his fellow-wolves in strength, size, and</p>
            <p>swiftness, so that they unanimously decided to call him &quot;Lion.&quot;</p>
            <p>The Wolf, with a lack of sense proportioned to his enormous size,</p>
            <p>thought that they gave him this name in earnest, and, leaving his</p>
            <p>own race, consorted exclusively with the lions. An old sly Fox,</p>
            <p>seeing this, said, &quot;May I never make myself so ridiculous 
              as you</p>
            <p>do in your pride and self-conceit; for even though you have the</p>
            <p>size of a lion among wolves, in a herd of lions you are</p>
            <p>definitely a wolf.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Walnut-Tree</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A WALNUT TREE standing by the roadside bore an abundant </p>
            <p>crop of fruit. For the sake of the nuts, the passers-by broke its</p>
            <p>branches with stones and sticks. The Walnut-Tree piteously</p>
            <p>exclaimed, &quot;O wretched me! that those whom I cheer with my 
              fruit</p>
            <p>should repay me with these painful requitals!&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Gnat and the Lion</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A GNAT came and said to a Lion, &quot;I do not in the least fear 
              you,</p>
            <p>nor are you stronger than I am. For in what does your strength</p>
            <p>consist? You can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth</p>
            <p>an a woman in her quarrels. I repeat that I am altogether more</p>
            <p>powerful than you; and if you doubt it, let us fight and see who</p>
            <p>will conquer.&quot; The Gnat, having sounded his horn, fastened</p>
            <p>himself upon the Lion and stung him on the nostrils and the parts</p>
            <p>of the face devoid of hair. While trying to crush him, the Lion</p>
            <p>tore himself with his claws, until he punished himself severely. 
            </p>
            <p>The Gnat thus prevailed over the Lion, and, buzzing about in a</p>
            <p>song of triumph, flew away. But shortly afterwards he became</p>
            <p>entangled in the meshes of a cobweb and was eaten by a spider. 
            </p>
            <p>He greatly lamented his fate, saying, &quot;Woe is me! that I, 
              who can</p>
            <p>wage war successfully with the hugest beasts, should perish</p>
            <p>myself from this spider, the most inconsiderable of insects!&quot;

            <p align="center"><b>The Monkey and the Dolphin</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A SAILOR, bound on a long voyage, took with him a Monkey to </p>
            <p>amuse him while on shipboard. As he sailed off the coast of </p>
            <p>Greece, a violent tempest arose in which the ship was wrecked and</p>
            <p> he, his Monkey, and all the crew were obliged to swim for their 
            </p>
            <p> lives. A Dolphin saw the Monkey contending with the waves, and 
            </p>
            <p> supposing him to be a man (whom he is always said to befriend), 
            </p>
            <p> came and placed himself under him, to convey him on his back in 
            </p>
            <p> safety to the shore. When the Dolphin arrived with his burden 
              in </p>
            <p>sight of land not far from Athens, he asked the Monkey if he were</p>
            <p> an Athenian. The latter replied that he was, and that he was</p>
            <p>descended from one of the most noble families in that city. The</p>
            <p>Dolphin then inquired if he knew the Piraeus (the famous harbor</p>
            <p>of Athens). Supposing that a man was meant, the Monkey </p>
            <p>answered that he knew him very well and that he was an intimate 
            </p>
            <p> friend. </p>
            <p>The Dolphin, indignant at these falsehoods, dipped the Monkey</p>
            <p>under the water and drowned him. </p>

              <b>The Fox and the Crane</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A FOX invited a Crane to supper and provided nothing for his</p>
            <p>entertainment but some soup made of pulse, which was poured out</p>
            <p>into a broad flat stone dish. The soup fell out of the long bill 
              of the</p>
            <p> Crane at every mouthful, and his vexation at not being able to 
              eat </p>
            <p>afforded the Fox much amusement. The Crane, in his turn, asked 
            </p>
            <p> the Fox to sup with him, and set before her a flagon with a long 
            </p>
            <p> narrow mouth, so that he could easily insert his neck and enjoy 
              its</p>
            <p> contents at his leisure. The Fox, unable even to taste it, met 
              with a</p>
            <p> fitting requital, after the fashion of her own hospitality. </p>
            <p align="center"></p>

            <p align="center"><b>Jupiter, Neptune, Minerva, and Momus </b></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>ACCORDING to an ancient legend, the first man was made by</p>
            <p>Jupiter, the first bull by Neptune, and the first house by Minerva. 
            </p>
            <p> On the completion of their labors, a dispute arose as to which 
              had</p>
            <p> made the most perfect work. They agreed to appoint Momus as </p>
            <p>judge, and to abide by his decision. Momus, however, being very 
            </p>
            <p> envious of the handicraft of each, found fault with all. He first 
            </p>
            <p> blamed the work of Neptune because he had not made the horns of</p>
            <p> the bull below his eyes, so he might better see where to strike. 
              He</p>
            <p> then condemned the work of Jupiter, because he had not placed 
            </p>
            <p> the heart of man on the outside, that everyone might read the 
            </p>
            <p> thoughts of the evil disposed and take precautions against the 
            </p>
            <p> intended mischief. And, lastly, he inveighed against Minerva </p>
            <p>because she had not contrived iron wheels in the foundation of 
              her</p>
            <p> house, so its inhabitants might more easily remove if a neighbor 
            </p>
            <p> proved unpleasant. Jupiter, indignant at such inveterate faultfinding,</p>
            <p> drove him from his office of judge, and expelled him from the 
            </p>
            <p> mansions of Olympus. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Eagle and the Fox</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>AN EAGLE and a Fox formed an intimate friendship and decided </p>
            <p>to live near each other. The Eagle built her nest in the branches</p>
            <p>of a tall tree, while the Fox crept into the underwood and there</p>
            <p>produced her young. Not long after they had agreed upon this</p>
            <p>plan, the Eagle, being in want of provision for her young ones,</p>
            <p>swooped down while the Fox was out, seized upon one of the little</p>
            <p>cubs, and feasted herself and her brood. The Fox on her return,</p>
            <p>discovered what had happened, but was less grieved for the death</p>
            <p>of her young than for her inability to avenge them. A just</p>
            <p>retribution, however, quickly fell upon the Eagle. While</p>
            <p>hovering near an altar, on which some villagers were sacrificing</p>
            <p>a goat, she suddenly seized a piece of the flesh, and carried it,</p>
            <p>along with a burning cinder, to her nest. A strong breeze soon</p>
            <p>fanned the spark into a flame, and the eaglets, as yet unfledged</p>
            <p>and helpless, were roasted in their nest and dropped down dead 
              at</p>
            <p>the bottom of the tree. There, in the sight of the Eagle, the</p>
            <p>Fox gobbled them up. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Man and the Satyr</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A MAN and a Satyr once drank together in token of a bond of</p>
            <p>alliance being formed between them. One very cold wintry day, as</p>
            <p>they talked, the Man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on</p>
            <p>them. When the Satyr asked the reason for this, he told him that</p>
            <p>he did it to warm his hands because they were so cold. Later on</p>
            <p>in the day they sat down to eat, and the food prepared was quite</p>
            <p>scalding. The Man raised one of the dishes a little towards his</p>
            <p>mouth and blew in it. When the Satyr again inquired the reason,</p>
            <p>he said that he did it to cool the meat, which was too hot. &quot;I</p>
            <p>can no longer consider you as a friend,&quot; said the Satyr, &quot;a</p>
            <p>fellow who with the same breath blows hot and cold.&quot;</p>

              <b>The Boys and the Frogs</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>SOME BOYS, playing near a pond, saw a number of Frogs in the</p>
            <p>water and began to pelt them with stones. They killed several of</p>
            <p>them, when one of the Frogs, lifting his head out of the water,</p>
            <p>cried out: &quot;Pray stop, my boys: what is sport to you, is death 
              to</p>
            <p>us.&quot; </p>
            <p align="center"> </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Sick Stag</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A SICK STAG lay down in a quiet corner of its pasture-ground. </p>
            <p>His companions came in great numbers to inquire after his health,</p>
            <p>and each one helped himself to a share of the food which had been</p>
            <p>placed for his use; so that he died, not from his sickness, but</p>
            <p>from the failure of the means of living. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Evil companions bring more hurt than profit. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Salt Merchant and His Ass</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A PEDDLER drove his Ass to the seashore to buy salt. His road</p>
            <p>home lay across a stream into which his Ass, making a false step,</p>
            <p>fell by accident and rose up again with his load considerably</p>
            <p>lighter, as the water melted the sack. The Peddler retraced his</p>
            <p>steps and refilled his panniers with a larger quantity of salt 
              than </p>
            <p>before. When he came again to the stream, the Ass fell down</p>
            <p>on purpose in the same spot, and, regaining his feet with the</p>
            <p>weight of his load much diminished, brayed triumphantly as if he</p>
            <p>had obtained what he desired. The Peddler saw through his trick</p>
            <p>and drove him for the third time to the coast, where he bought 
              a</p>
            <p>cargo of sponges instead of salt. The Ass, again playing the</p>
            <p>fool, fell down on purpose when he reached the stream, but the</p>
            <p>sponges became swollen with water, greatly increasing his load. 
            </p>
            <p>And thus his trick recoiled on him, for he now carried on his</p>
            <p>back a double burden. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Oxen and the Butchers</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>THE OXEN once upon a time sought to destroy the Butchers, </p>
            <p>who practiced a trade destructive to their race. They assembled 
              on</p>
            <p> a certain day to carry out their purpose, and sharpened their 
              horns</p>
            <p>for the contest. But one of them who was exceedingly old (for</p>
            <p>many a field had he plowed) thus spoke: &quot;These Butchers, it 
              is</p>
            <p>true, slaughter us, but they do so with skillful hands, and with</p>
            <p>no unnecessary pain. If we get rid of them, we shall fall into 
              the </p>
            <p>hands of unskillful operators, and thus suffer a double death: 
              for </p>
            <p>you may be assured, that though all the Butchers should perish, 
              yet</p>
            <p> will men never want beef.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Do not be in a hurry to change one evil for another. </p>

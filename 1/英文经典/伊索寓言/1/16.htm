              <b> The Wolves and the Sheep</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>&quot;WHY SHOULD there always be this fear and slaughter between 
            </p>
            <p> us?&quot; said the Wolves to the Sheep. &quot;Those evil-disposed 
              Dogs </p>
            <p>have much to answer for. They always bark whenever we pproach</p>
            <p> you and attack us before we have done any harm. If you would </p>
            <p>only dismiss them from your heels, there might soon be treaties 
              of</p>
            <p> peace and reconciliation between us.&quot; The Sheep, poor silly 
            </p>
            <p> creatures, were easily beguiled and dismissed the Dogs, whereupon</p>
            <p> the Wolves destroyed the unguarded flock at their own pleasure.

            <p align="center"><b>The Old Woman and the Physician</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>AN OLD WOMAN having lost the use of her eyes, called in a</p>
            <p>Physician to heal them, and made this bargain with him in the</p>
            <p>presence of witnesses: that if he should cure her blindness, he</p>
            <p>should receive from her a sum of money; but if her infirmity</p>
            <p>remained, she should give him nothing. This agreement being</p>
            <p>made, the Physician, time after time, applied his salve to her</p>
            <p>eyes, and on every visit took something away, stealing all her</p>
            <p>property little by little. And when he had got all she had, he</p>
            <p>healed her and demanded the promised payment. The Old Woman,</p>
            <p>when she recovered her sight and saw none of her goods in her</p>
            <p>house, would give him nothing. The Physician insisted on his</p>
            <p>claim, and. as she still refused, summoned her before the Judge. 
            </p>
            <p>The Old Woman, standing up in the Court, argued: &quot;This man 
              here</p>
            <p>speaks the truth in what he says; for I did promise to give him 
              a</p>
            <p>sum of money if I should recover my sight: but if I continued</p>
            <p>blind, I was to give him nothing. Now he declares that I am healed.</p>
            <p> I on the contrary affirm that I am still blind; for when I lost 
              the use</p>
            <p> of my eyes, I saw in my house various chattels and valuable goods</p>
            <p>: but now, though he swears I am cured of my blindness, I am not</p>
            <p> able to see a single thing in it.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Fighting Cocks and the Eagle</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>TWO GAME COCKS were fiercely fighting for the mastery of the</p>
            <p>farmyard. One at last put the other to flight. The vanquished</p>
            <p>Cock skulked away and hid himself in a quiet corner, while the</p>
            <p>conqueror, flying up to a high wall, flapped his wings and crowed</p>
            <p>exultingly with all his might. An Eagle sailing through the air</p>
            <p>pounced upon him and carried him off in his talons. The</p>
            <p>vanquished Cock immediately came out of his corner, and ruled</p>
            <p>henceforth with undisputed mastery. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Pride goes before destruction. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A CHARGER, feeling the infirmities of age, was sent to work in 
              a</p>
            <p>mill instead of going out to battle. But when he was compelled</p>
            <p>to grind instead of serving in the wars, he bewailed his change</p>
            <p>of fortune and called to mind his former state, saying, &quot;Ah!</p>
            <p>Miller, I had indeed to go campaigning before, but I was barbed</p>
            <p>from counter to tail, and a man went along to groom me; and now 
              I</p>
            <p>cannot understand what ailed me to prefer the mill before the</p>
            <p>battle.&quot; &quot;Forbear,&quot; said the Miller to him, &quot;harping 
              on what was</p>
            <p>of yore, for it is the common lot of mortals to sustain the ups</p>
            <p>and downs of fortune.&quot; </p>

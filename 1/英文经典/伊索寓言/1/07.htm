              <b>The Tortoise and the Eagle</b> </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>A TORTOISE, lazily basking in the sun, complained to the</p>
            <p>sea-birds of her hard fate, that no one would teach her to fly. 
            </p>
            <p>An Eagle, hovering near, heard her lamentation and demanded what</p>
            <p>reward she would give him if he would take her aloft and float</p>
            <p>her in the air. &quot;I will give you,&quot; she said, &quot;all 
              the riches of the Red </p>
            <p>Sea.&quot; &quot;I will teach you to fly then,&quot; said the Eagle; 
              and taking her </p>
            <p>up in his talons he carried her almost to the clouds suddenly he 
              let </p>
            <p>her go, and she fell on a lofty mountain, dashing her shell to 
              pieces</p>
            <p>. The Tortoise exclaimed in the moment of death: &quot;I have deserved</p>
            <p> my present fate; for what had I to do with wings and clouds, who 
            </p>
            <p> can with difficulty move about on the earth?' </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>If men had all they wished, they would be often ruined. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A NUMBER of Flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had </p>
            <p>been overturned in a housekeeper's room, and placing their feet 
              in</p>
            <p> it, ate greedily. Their feet, however, became so smeared with 
              the</p>
            <p>honey that they could not use their wings, nor release themselves, 
            </p>
            <p>and were suffocated. Just as they were expiring, they exclaimed, 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;O foolish creatures that we are, for the sake of a little 
              pleasure we</p>
            <p> have destroyed ourselves.&quot; </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A MAN and a Lion traveled together through the forest. They soon</p>
            <p>began to boast of their respective superiority to each other in</p>
            <p>strength and prowess. As they were disputing, they passed a</p>
            <p>statue carved in stone, which represented &quot;a Lion strangled 
              by a</p>
            <p>Man.&quot; The traveler pointed to it and said: &quot;See there! 
              How strong</p>
            <p>we are, and how we prevail over even the king of beasts.&quot; 
              The</p>
            <p>Lion replied: &quot;This statue was made by one of you men. If 
              we</p>
            <p>Lions knew how to erect statues, you would see the Man placed</p>
            <p>under the paw of the Lion.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>One story is good, till another is told. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>SOME CRANES made their feeding grounds on some plowlands</p>
            <p>newly sown with wheat. For a long time the Farmer, brandishing 
              an</p>
            <p>empty sling, chased them away by the terror he inspired; but when</p>
            <p>the birds found that the sling was only swung in the air, they 
            </p>
            <p> ceased to take any notice of it and would not move. The Farmer,</p>
            <p>on seeing this, charged his sling with stones, and killed a great</p>
            <p>number. The remaining birds at once forsook his fields, crying</p>
            <p>to each other, &quot;It is time for us to be off to Liliput: for 
              this man is </p>
            <p>no longer content to scare us, but begins to show us in earnest

              <b>The Farmer and the Fox</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A FARMER, who bore a grudge against a Fox for robbing his </p>
            <p>poultry yard, caught him at last, and being determined to take 
              an </p>
            <p>ample revenge, tied some rope well soaked in oil to his tail, and 
              set</p>
            <p>it on fire. The Fox by a strange fatality rushed to the fields</p>
            <p>of the Farmer who had captured him. It was the time of the wheat</p>
            <p>harvest; but the Farmer reaped nothing that year and returned</p>
            <p>home grieving sorely. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Seagull and the Kite</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A SEAGULL having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep</p>
            <p>gullet-bag and lay down on the shore to die. A Kite saw him and</p>
            <p>exclaimed: &quot;You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the 
              air</p>
            <p>has no business to seek its food from the sea.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Every man should be content to mind his own business. </p>

            <p>The Philosopher, the Ants, and Mercury </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A PHILOSOPHER witnessed from the shore the shipwreck of a</p>
            <p>vessel, of which the crew and passengers were all drowned. He </p>
            <p>inveighed against the injustice of Providence, which would for 
              the </p>
            <p>sake of one criminal perchance sailing in the ship allow so many 
            </p>
            <p> innocent persons to perish. As he was indulging in these </p>
            <p>reflections, he found himself surrounded by a whole army of Ants,</p>
            <p> near whose nest he was standing. One of them climbed up and </p>
            <p>stung him, and he immediately trampled them all to death with his 
            </p>
            <p>foot. Mercury presented himself, and striking the Philosopher with</p>
            <p> his wand, said, &quot;And are you indeed to make yourself a judge 
              of </p>
            <p>the dealings of Providence, who hast thyself in a similar manner</p>
            <p>treated these poor Ants?' </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A BULL was bitten by a Mouse and, angered by the wound, tried </p>
            <p>to capture him. But the Mouse reached his hole in safety. Though</p>
            <p>the Bull dug into the walls with his horns, he tired before he</p>
            <p>could rout out the Mouse, and crouching down, went to sleep</p>
            <p>outside the hole. The Mouse peeped out, crept furtively up his</p>
            <p>flank, and again biting him, retreated to his hole. The Bull</p>
            <p>rising up, and not knowing what to do, was sadly perplexed. At</p>
            <p>which the Mouse said, &quot;The great do not always prevail. There</p>
            <p>are times when the small and lowly are the strongest to do</p>
            <p>mischief.&quot;</p>

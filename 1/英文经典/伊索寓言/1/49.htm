              <b>The Wolf and the Shepherd</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A WOLF followed a flock of sheep for a long time and did not</p>
            <p>attempt to injure one of them. The Shepherd at first stood on</p>
            <p>his guard against him, as against an enemy, and kept a strict</p>
            <p>watch over his movements. But when the Wolf, day after day, kept</p>
            <p>in the company of the sheep and did not make the slightest effort</p>
            <p>to seize them, the Shepherd began to look upon him as a guardian</p>
            <p>of his flock rather than as a plotter of evil against it; and when 
            </p>
            <p> occasion called him one day into the city, he left the sheep entirely 
            </p>
            <p>in his charge. The Wolf, now that he had the opportunity, fell 
              upon</p>
            <p> the sheep, and destroyed the greater part of the flock. When the 
            </p>
            <p> Shepherd returned to find his flock destroyed, he exclaimed: &quot;I 
            </p>
            <p> have been rightly served; why did I trust my sheep to a Wolf?'

            <p> </p>
            <p>THE HARES harangued the assembly, and argued that all should </p>
            <p>be equal. The Lions made this reply: &quot;Your words, O Hares! 
              are</p>
            <p>good; but they lack both claws and teeth such as we have.&quot;

            <p> </p>
            <p>A LARK had made her nest in the early spring on the young green</p>
            <p>wheat. The brood had almost grown to their full strength and</p>
            <p>attained the use of their wings and the full plumage of their</p>
            <p>feathers, when the owner of the field, looking over his ripe</p>
            <p>crop, said, &quot;The time has come when I must ask all my neighbors</p>
            <p>to help me with my harvest.&quot; One of the young Larks heard 
              his</p>
            <p>speech and related it to his mother, inquiring of her to what</p>
            <p>place they should move for safety. &quot;There is no occasion to 
              move</p>
            <p>yet, my son,&quot; she replied; &quot;the man who only sends to 
              his friends</p>
            <p>to help him with his harvest is not really in earnest.&quot; The 
              owner</p>
            <p>of the field came again a few days later and saw the wheat</p>
            <p>shedding the grain from excess of ripeness. He said, &quot;I will</p>
            <p>come myself tomorrow with my laborers, and with as many </p>
            <p>reapers as I can hire, and will get in the harvest.&quot; The Lark 
              on </p>
            <p>hearing these words said to her brood, &quot;It is time now to 
              be off, </p>
            <p>my little ones, for the man is in earnest this time; he no longer</p>
            <p>trusts his friends, but will reap the field himself.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Self-help is the best help. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>WHEN A FOX who had never yet seen a Lion, fell in with him by</p>
            <p>chance for the first time in the forest, he was so frightened</p>
            <p>that he nearly died with fear. On meeting him for the second</p>
            <p>time, he was still much alarmed, but not to the same extent as 
              at</p>
            <p>first. On seeing him the third time, he so increased in boldness</p>
            <p>that he went up to him and commenced a familiar conversation with 
              him. </p>

              <b>The Dog in the Manger</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A DOG lay in a manger, and by his growling and snapping </p>
            <p>prevented the oxen from eating the hay which had been placed for 
            </p>
            <p> them. </p>
            <p>&quot;What a selfish Dog!&quot; said one of them to his companions; 
              &quot;he</p>
            <p>cannot eat the hay himself, and yet refuses to allow those to eat</p>
            <p>who can.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Fox and the Goat</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A FOX one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of</p>
            <p>escape. A Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and</p>
            <p>seeing the Fox, inquired if the water was good. Concealing his</p>
            <p>sad plight under a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise 
            </p>
            <p> of the water, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and </p>
            <p>encouraging him to descend. The Goat, mindful only of his</p>
            <p>thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the Fox</p>
            <p>informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested 
              a</p>
            <p>scheme for their common escape. &quot;If,&quot; said he, &quot;you 
              will place</p>
            <p>your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up</p>
            <p>your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards.&quot; The 
              Goat</p>
            <p>readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back. Steadying</p>
            <p>himself with the Goat's horns, he safely reached the mouth of the</p>
            <p>well and made off as fast as he could. When the Goat upbraided</p>
            <p>him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out,</p>
            <p>&quot;You foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your 
              head</p>
            <p>as you have hairs in your beard, you would never have gone down</p>
            <p>before you had inspected the way up, nor have exposed yourself 
            </p>
            <p> to dangers from which you had no means of escape.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Look before you leap. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>TWO MEN were traveling together, when a Bear suddenly met </p>
            <p>them on their path. One of them climbed up quickly into a tree 
              and</p>
            <p>concealed himself in the branches. The other, seeing that he must 
            </p>
            <p> be attacked, fell flat on the ground, and when the Bear came up 
            </p>
            <p> and felt him with his snout, and smelt him all over, he held his 
            </p>
            <p> breath, and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could. 
            </p>
            <p> The Bear soon left him, for it is said he will not touch a dead 
              body.</p>
            <p> When he was quite gone, the other Traveler descended from the 
            </p>
            <p> tree, and jocularly inquired of his friend what it was the Bear 
              had </p>
            <p>whispered in his ear. &quot;He gave me this advice,&quot; his companion 
            </p>
            <p> replied. &quot;Never travel with a friend who deserts you at the 
            </p>
            <p> approach of danger.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Misfortune tests the sincerity of friends. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A HEAVY WAGON was being dragged along a country lane by a</p>
            <p> team of Oxen. The Axle-trees groaned and creaked terribly; </p>
            <p>whereupon the Oxen, turning round, thus addressed the wheels: </p>
            <p>&quot;Hullo there! why do you make so much noise? We bear all the 
            </p>
            <p> labor, and we, not you, ought to cry out.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Those who suffer most cry out the least. </p>

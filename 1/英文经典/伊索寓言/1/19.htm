              <b>The Kid and the Wolf</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A KID standing on the roof of a house, out of harm's way, saw a</p>
            <p>Wolf passing by and immediately began to taunt and revile him. 
            </p>
            <p>The Wolf, looking up, said, &quot;Sirrah! I hear thee: yet it is 
              not</p>
            <p>thou who mockest me, but the roof on which thou art standing.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Time and place often give the advantage to the weak over the</p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>AN OX drinking at a pool trod on a brood of young frogs and</p>
            <p>crushed one of them to death. The Mother coming up, and missing</p>
            <p>one of her sons, inquired of his brothers what had become of him. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He is dead, dear Mother; for just now a very huge beast with</p>
            <p>four great feet came to the pool and crushed him to death with</p>
            <p>his cloven heel.&quot; The Frog, puffing herself out, inquired, 
              &quot;if</p>
            <p>the beast was as big as that in size.&quot; &quot;Cease, Mother, 
              to puff</p>
            <p>yourself out,&quot; said her son, &quot;and do not be angry; for 
              you would,</p>
            <p>I assure you, sooner burst than successfully imitate the hugeness</p>

            <p> A SHEPHERD once found the whelp of a Wolf and brought it up,</p>
            <p> and after a while taught it to steal lambs from the neighboring</p>
            <p>flocks. The Wolf, having shown himself an apt pupil, said to the</p>
            <p>Shepherd, &quot;Since you have taught me to steal, you must keep 
              a</p>
            <p>sharp lookout, or you will lose some of your own flock.&quot; </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A MAN had two daughters, the one married to a gardener, and the</p>
            <p>other to a tile-maker. After a time he went to the daughter who</p>
            <p>had married the gardener, and inquired how she was and how all</p>
            <p>things went with her. She said, &quot;All things are prospering 
              with</p>
            <p>me, and I have only one wish, that there may be a heavy fall of</p>
            <p>rain, in order that the plants may be well watered.&quot; Not long</p>
            <p>after, he went to the daughter who had married the tilemaker, and</p>
            <p>likewise inquired of her how she fared; she replied, &quot;I want 
              for</p>
            <p>nothing, and have only one wish, that the dry weather may</p>
            <p>continue, and the sun shine hot and bright, so that the bricks</p>
            <p>might be dried.&quot; He said to her, &quot;If your sister wishes 
              for rain,</p>
            <p>and you for dry weather, with which of the two am I to join my</p>
            <p>wishes?' </p>

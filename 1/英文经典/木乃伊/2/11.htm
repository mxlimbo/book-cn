                INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT</p>
              <p>O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay slosh their way down the<br>
                watery catacomb, crazies pouring in behind them. Up ahead, a<br>
                LIGHT suddenly shines in from another cistern hole, and then<br>
                more of the infected crowd drop down, SCREECHING like rats.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>O'Connell jags right, pushing Jonathan and Ardeth Bay ahead<br>
                of him, he strikes a match off the wall, lights the nubby<br>
                fuse on a stick of dynamite, throws it, and runs like hell.</p>
              <p>FIRE BLAST incinerates a bunch of crazies.</p>
              <p>STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT</p>
              <p>The EXPLOSION blows a cistern cover fifty feet into the air,<br>
                followed by a mass of FLAMMAGE ..............</p>
              <p>EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT</p>
              <p>A sewer grate is kicked out of a wall. O'Connell, Jonathan<br>
                and Ardeth Bay climb out of the hole and into AN ALLEY.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> We gotta get her back.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> I'm with you, old man. No one<br>
                touches my sister like that and<br>
                gets away with it.</p>
              <p>O'Connell looks at Ardeth Bay,</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> You know where he's taking her?</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform<br>
                the ritual.</p>
              <p>Jonathan looks worried.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> And what ritual would that be?</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> The ritual to bring the body of<br>
                Anck-su-namun back to life.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> And how does one do that?</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> By reading the Book Of The Dead.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Oh yes, of course.</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> And then killing your sister.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Excuse me?</p>
              <p>Ardeth Bay looks at O'Connell,</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> Imhotep is now able to cross the<br>
                desert with great haste.</p>
              <p>Jonathan taps him in the shoulder,</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Begging your pardon, but I wasn't<br>
                quite clear on that last part.</p>
              <p>Ardeth Bay ignores him,</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> If he arrives before us, it will<br>
                be too late.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Did you say 'kill' my sister?</p>
              <p>O'Connell smiles</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I know how to beat him to it.</p>
              <p>And on that WE SMASH CUT TO-- THE ERFOUD DUNES - DAWN<br>
                Jonathan's bashed-in convertible steams it's way up to a set<br>
                of semi-abandoned Quonset huts. A single WWI BIPLANE with<br>
                R.A.F. INSIGNIAS sits in the sand beside them. A SIGN READS:</p>
              <p>HIS MAJESTY'S ROYAL AIR CORP</p>
              <p>EXT. QUONSET HUT - DUNES - MINUTES LATER</p>
              <p>O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay stand before Winston<br>
                Havlock, the massive dunes of Erfoud as our background.</p>
              <p> WINSTON</p>
              <p> So what's your little problem<br>
                got to do with His Majesty's<br>
                Royal Air Corp?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Not a god-damned thing.</p>
              <p>Winston looks intrigued.</p>
              <p> WINSTON</p>
              <p> is it dangerous?</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> You probably won't live through it,</p>
              <p>This really interests him.</p>
              <p> WINSTON</p>
              <p> By Jove, do you really think so?</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Everybody else we've bumped into<br>
                has died, why not you?</p>
              <p>Winston nods his head, he's hooked.</p>
              <p> WINSTON</p>
              <p> So what's the challenge then?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> To save the damsel in distress,<br>
                kill the bad guy and steal his<br>
                treasure.</p>
              <p>A slow grin spreads across Winston's face, then he gives them<br>
                a snappy salute.</p>
              <p> WINSTON</p>
              <p> Winston Havlock at your service, sir!</p>
              <p>SAHARA - DAY</p>
              <p>Way off across the desert, a large SAND-DEVIL races over the<br>
                dunes. The SANDY WHIRLWIND comes to a stop and starts to<br>
                dissipate. Evelyn and Beni are suddenly ejected out of it,<br>
                they land in a dune. The SWIRLING SAND CONDENSES AND FORMS<br>
                INTO IMHOTEP. He looks up into the sky, listening carefully.</p>
              <p>Evelyn shakes the sand out of her hair and looks at Beni.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> what just happened?</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> All I remember is him turning<br>
                into a blast of sand, ....and<br>
                then I remember nothing.<br>
                then they hear a plane in the sky and look up.</p>
              <p>INT. BIPLANE - DAY</p>
              <p>The WIND whips at Winston in the cockpit. O'Connell sits in<br>
                the gunner's compartment. Jonathan is strapped spread-eagle<br>
                across the left wing, Ardeth Bay is tied tight to the right.</p>
              <p>Both men are scared out of their wits and SCREAMING in fear.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. SAHARA - DAY</p>
              <p>Imhotep's jaw UNHINGES, his mouth opens to an inhuman size,<br>
                he lets fly with another one of his horrible SHRIEKS. --And<br>
                a massive WALL OF SAND rises up out of the desert</p>
              <p>BIPLANE - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell watches the desert below him come alive and rise<br>
                up towards the plane. Winston looks over the side and sees<br>
                what's coming. He laughs, throws the throttle, and puts the<br>
                plane into a dive.</p>
              <p> WINSTON</p>
              <p> Hang on, men!</p>
              <p>WE GO WIDE AS: The sandstorm chases the diving, twisting<br>
                biplane. Getting closer and closer, about to engulf it.<br>
                O'Connell looks back into the blinding sand and sees a GIANT<br>
                FACE forming inside the sandstorm. It's Imhotep. Grinning.<br>
                O'Connell grabs the Lewis machine-gun, cocks the bracket and<br>
                FIRES, blasting away at Imhotep's giant face inside the<br>
                sandstorm. Imhotep's face begins to laugh, then his jaw<br>
                unhinges, his mouth opens wide, and he ENGULFS the plane.<br>
                Winston blindly fights for control, elated.</p>
              <p> WINSTON</p>
              <p> We're going down!</p>
              <p>The biplane SPINS inside the BLOWING SAND. Engines ROARING.<br>
                Wind HOWLING. Jonathan and Ardeth Bay SCREAMING. Winston<br>
                Havlock LAUGHING.</p>
              <p> WINSTON</p>
              <p> Here I come, laddies!</p>
              <p>O'Connell braces himself for impact,</p>
              <p>SAHARA - DAY</p>
              <p>Evelyn leaps to her feet and runs over to Imhotep.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Stop it! You'll kill them!</p>
              <p>Imhotep grabs her, pulls her close, her beautiful eyes stare<br>
                into his shockingly intense ones. Then he kisses her, hard.<br>
                Evelyn's eyes widen, stunned and mesmerized, then she pushes<br>
                herself away and falls back into the sand. Imhotep laughs.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. BIPLANE - DUNES - DAY</p>
              <p>The biplane SMASHES over a dune, ROLLS OVER and CRASHES<br>
                upside-down into another dune. The SAND SWIRLS as O'Connell<br>
                falls out of the gunner's compartment. The left wing is<br>
                jammed into the dune, Jonathan hangs upside down.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Excuse me. ...A little help<br>
                would be useful. ...IF IT'S<br>
                NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE!!</p>
              <p>O'Connell goes to help Jonathan. Ardeth Bay stumbles over to<br>
                the gunner's compartment and tears the Lewis gun off it's<br>
                mount. He throws the machine-gun over one shoulder, a<br>
                cartridge belt over the other and staggers away. O'Connell<br>
                and Jonathan look into the cockpit. Winston Havlock is dead.</p>
              <p>A smile on his face. The plane suddenly starts to move, the<br>
                sand sinks under their feet, they quickly high-tail-it away.</p>
              <p>O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay make it to some rocks and<br>
                look back. The biplane, with Winston Havlock inside, slides<br>
                away over a dune. O'Connell gives it a salute. The plane<br>
                vanishes over the dune and into the SWIRLING SAND ...........</p>
              <p>HAMUNAPTRA - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay come down a ravine in the<br>
                volcano and look out over the ruins of Hamunaptra.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Okay, now what the hell does<br>
                this Horus guy look like?</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> He's a big fellow with pointy<br>
                ears and a face like a falcon.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Got it</p>
              <p>HAMUNAPTRA STAIRWAY - DAY</p>
              <p>Carrying TORCHES, O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay make<br>
                their way down a long, winding, narrow staircase. Heading<br>
                into the bowels of the necropolis. A passageway to hell.</p>
              <p>NECROPOLIS - DAY</p>
              <p>Evelyn follows Imhotep into the underground cemetery.<br>
                She stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying<br>
                through the mausoleums and over the gravestones. Beni shoves<br>
                his rifle into her back and pushes her forward.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Keep moving</p>
              <p>Evelyn gives him a look.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> You know, nasty little fellows<br>
                such as yourself, always get<br>
                their comeuppance.</p>
              <p>Beni suddenly looks worried.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Yeah?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Oh yes, always,</p>
              <p>Beni looks even more worried, he nervously starts chewing on<br>
                his lip. All three of them walk over the bridge crossing the<br>
                disgusting DETRITUS MOAT. Evelyn looks down at it, horrified.</p>
              <p>INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell and Ardeth Bay are busy digging out a collapsed<br>
                doorway. Jonathan notices an AMETHYST SCARAB on the far wall.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> I say, look at that.</p>
              <p>He walks over and tries to jiggle it free. It comes loose in<br>
                his hand. He looks at the scarab in his palm. It starts to<br>
                glow. And then something inside it starts to WIGGLE.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Say, gents! You should come<br>
                have a look at this.</p>
              <p>The wiggling continues; a long, agonizing BEAT, and then the<br>
                scarab breaks out of it's cocoon and instantly BURROWS into<br>
                Jonathan's palm. Jonathan starts to freak out and SCREAM.</p>
              <p>O'Connell runs up and rips the arm off Jonathan's shirt. The<br>
                scarab is now BURROWING UP JONATHAN'S ARM. O'Connell whips<br>
                out his butterfly-knife, snaps it open and grabs Jonathan's<br>
                arm. Jonathan's eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in<br>
                front of his face. Jonathan SCREAMS LOUDER, obviously being<br>
                cut open. O'Connell's hand flicks something away.</p>
              <p>The scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying<br>
                back towards Jonathan, wanting to finish the job.</p>
              <p>O'Connell pulls out his gun and blows it away, --BLAM!</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>INT. CEMETERY - DAY</p>
              <p>The GUNSHOT echoes into the cemetery as Imhotep, Evelyn and<br>
                Beni step6up to the strange ALTAR, where four thousand years<br>
                ago Imhotep tried to bring Anck-su-namun back to life.</p>
              <p>Imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a<br>
                CANOPIC JAR. He pulls out the crusted remains of Anck-su-<br>
                namun's heart, crushes it to dust in his hand and starts<br>
                reading from The Book Of The Dead. Then he BLOWS the dust<br>
                against a mausoleum wall, --THE WALL STARTS TO COME ALIVE.</p>
              <p>Evelyn and Beni stare at the wall, both of them wide-eyed.<br>
                TWO FORMS emerge from the mausoleum's wall. Horrific-looking<br>
                mummified CORPSES. , Two of Imhotep's long dead Priests. They<br>
                bow to Imhotep,-then turn and move off down a passageway.</p>
              <p>INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY</p>

                EXT. RUINS - NIGHT</p>
              <p>O'Connell and Jonathan boost Evelyn up onto a camel. Daniels<br>
                and Henderson throw Burns up onto another. The Egyptologist,<br>
                still clutching The Book Of The Dead, gets up on yet another.<br>
                They all head off into the dark, windblown desert ..........</p>
              <p><br>
                And then in the extreme foreground, A SKELETAL HAND SUDDENLY<br>
                PUNCHES UP OUT OF THE SAND, ACCOMPANIED BY THE MOST HORRIFIC,<br>
                PRIMORDIAL SHRIEK IMAGINABLE---</p>
              <p>IMHOTEP</p>
              <p>ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!</p>
              <p>EXT. BRITISH FORT - CAIRO - DAY</p>
              <p>A British flag flies over BRITISH SOLDIERS manning the front<br>
                gate. our tired, disheveled Heroes saunter up on their dusty<br>
                camels. The Soldiers check their papers, then let them enter.</p>
              <p>INT. EVELYN'S QUARTERS - DAY</p>
              <p>A steamer trunk is slammed to the floor and thrown open.<br>
                O'Connell chucks a load of DRESSES into the trunk.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I thought you didn't believe<br>
                in this stuff!?</p>
              <p>O'Connell heads for the closet. Evelyn UNPACKS the dresses</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Having an encounter with a four<br>
                thousand year old walking-talking<br>
                corpse tends to convert one.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Forget it, we're out the door<br>
                down the hall and gone.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> No, we are not,</p>
              <p>O'Connell throws a handful of her underthings into the trunk,</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Oh yes we are.</p>
              <p>O'Connell continues to PACK Evelyn's clothes as she continues<br>
                to UNPACK them:</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> No we are not. We woke him up,<br>
                and we must try and stop him.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> We?! What we?! You didn't<br>
                read that book. I told you not<br>
                to play around with that thing.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Alright then, Me, I, ...I read the<br>
                book, I woke him up and I intend<br>
                to stop him.</p>
              <p>O'Connell angrily stretches a bra between his hands.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> How!? You heard the man, no mortal<br>
                weapons can kill this guy.</p>
              <p>Evelyn grabs the bra and throws it into a drawer.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Then we'll have to find some<br>
                immortal ones.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> There goes that alieff again. Not<br>
                me, I am outta here!</p>
              <p>O'Connell stuffs a pile of Evelyn's shoes into the trunk.<br>
                Evelyn KICKS the lid shut, slamming it on his fingers.<br>
                O'Connell YELPS and angrily storms around the room sucking<br>
                his fingers as Evelyn follows him.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> According to that Book, once<br>
                this creature has been reborn,<br>
                his curse will spread, and as<br>
                he grows in strength, so will<br>
                his curse grow, infecting the<br>
                people until the whole of the<br>
                earth is destroyed.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Yeah? So? Is that My problem?</p>
              <p> EVELYN (incredulous)</p>
              <p> It's everybody's problem!</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Look lady, I appreciate you<br>
                saving my life and all, but<br>
                when I signed on, I agreed to<br>
                take you out there and bring<br>
                you back, and I did, now were<br>
                even, end of job, end of story,<br>
                contract terminated.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> That's what I am to you? A contract?</p>
              <p><br>
                O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> You can either tag along with me,<br>
                or you can stay here and play<br>
                around with Mister Maggot.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> I'm staying.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> FINE</p>
              <p>O'Connell storms out and SLAMS the door. A BEAT. Then the<br>
                door opens and O'Connell's hand reaches back in and throws a<br>
                handful of frilly panties to the floor. SLAM goes the door.</p>
              <p>EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell angrily strides through the compound. He sees Beni<br>
                coming up the path with a MAN dressed in hooded robes, his<br>
                face covered by an ornate death mask. Imhotep disguised.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Beni ya little stinkweed,<br>
                where did you slink off to?</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> You left me! You left me in<br>
                the desert to rot.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Oh yeah, ....sorry bout that<br>
                (gestures to Imhotep)<br>
                So who's this guy?</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> This is Prince Imhotep, High<br>
                Priest of Osiris.<br>
                <br>
                O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Oh, hey, how ya doin'?</p>
              <p>O'Connell sticks out his hand, --Imhotep instantly recoils<br>
                O'Connell gives him the once-over. Beni quickly covers.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> The Prince does not like to be<br>
                touched by other humans. A Silly<br>
                eastern superstition, I'm afraid.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Yeah, well, we all got our<br>
                little problems today don't we?</p>
              <p><br>
                BENI</p>
              <p> He has come to help Mister Burns<br>
                Somehow I feel responsible.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Don't gimme that, you never had<br>
                any scruples.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Do you know where I can steal some?<br>
                O'Connell fake-punches him. Beni flinches. O'Connell gives<br>
                Imhotep a look as he strides off.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> See ya around, Padre.</p>
              <p>Imhotep's grotesque new eyes glare out from behind the mask.</p>
              <p>INT. CASBAH - DAY</p>
              <p>The proverbial den-of-iniquity. Hard men, hard women and hard<br>
                liquor. Lots of deals going down. An OLDER GUY with a walrus<br>
                mustache is drunk and talking to some tough customers. He<br>
                wears British WWI fighter pilot gear. Meet WINSTON HAVLOCK.</p>
              <p> WINSTON</p>
              <p> I'm the last of the Royal Force<br>
                still stationed here, you know?<br>
                All the other laddies died in the<br>
                air and were buried in the sand.</p>
              <p>The tough customers shove him away. Winston staggers over to<br>
                O'Connell and Jonathan at the bar, not missing a beat.</p>
              <p> WINSTON</p>
              <p> Ever since the end of the Great<br>
                War, there hasn't been a single<br>
                challenge worthy of a man like me.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I've heard it before, Winston,</p>
              <p>O'Connell shoves him away. Winston staggers back to Jonathan.</p>
              <p> WINSTON</p>
              <p> I just wish I would've chucked<br>
                it with the other laddies,<br>
                gone down in a flame of glory,<br>
                instead of sitting around here,<br>
                rotting from boredom and booze!</p>
              <p>Jonathan shoves him towards another group of unlucky sods<br>
                Henderson and Daniels sidle up to the bar next to them.</p>
              <p><br>
                Burns, now tongue-less, talks with a severe impediment</p>
              <p> BURNS</p>
              <p> The drawer there, spectacles.<br>
                (tries to laugh)<br>
                As you see, I won't be needing them.</p>
              <p>Imhotep opens the drawer and pulls out some bifocals. He puts<br>
                the bifocals on over his death mask, --and grins broadly, his<br>
                rotted teeth showing through the mouth hole.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Mister Burns, Prince Imhotep<br>
                thanks you for your spectacles,<br>
                - and for your eyes, ....and<br>
                for your tongue.</p>
              <p>The expression on Burns' face starts to change, very puzzled.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> But I am afraid more is needed,<br>
                the Prince says he must finish<br>
                the job, consummate the curse<br>
                which you and your friends have<br>
                brought down upon yourselves.</p>
              <p>A look of pure fear registers on Burns, face. Beni quickly<br>
                backs away and runs out of the room. Imhotep picks up the<br>
                sacred canopic jar, then removes the death mask, revealing<br>
                his hideous, shattered CORPSE-SKULL.</p>
              <p>INT. CASBAH - DAY</p>
              <p>Three shot glasses clink together. O'Connell, Jonathan and<br>
                Henderson slug 'em down, --all three of them instantly SPIT<br>
                OUT the liquid. Half the bar SPITS OUT their drinks as well.</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> Sweet Jesus! That tasted just<br>
                like, ....like...</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Blood.</p>
              <p>They all look at each other, even more nervous.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> &quot;And the rivers and waters of<br>
                Egypt went red and were<br>
                as blood.&quot;</p>
              <p>A look passes over O'Connell's face, a realization.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> He's here </p>
              <p>He sudden1y jumps away from the bar and runs for the door.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Who's here!?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!</p>
              <p>EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY</p>
              <p>LIGHTNING FLASHES as O'Connell races across the compound,<br>
                knocking several Soldiers out of his way, panic stricken.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Evelyn!! EVELYYYYNN!!!</p>
              <p>EXT. BRITISH FORT COURTYARD - DAY</p>
              <p>Evelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of<br>
                books. A BLAST OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING scares her. She drops<br>
                half the books. Then a HAND GRABS HER! She jumps again and<br>
                drops the rest of the books. It's O'Connell, breathing hard.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> We got problems.</p>
              <p>And that's when a barrage of HAIL AND FIRE slams into the<br>
                courtyard. O'Connell and Evelyn jump back. A water fountain<br>
                bursts into STEAM. A wooden trellis catches FIRE. O'Connell<br>
                and Evelyn run under the eaves as SOLDIERS, SERVANTS and<br>
                CAMELS run in every direction, trying to avoid the maelstrom.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> He's here! I saw him! That thing<br>
                is here!</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> The creature!? Are you sure!?</p>
              <p>O'Connell gives her an incredulous look and gestures at the<br>
                HAIL and FIRE.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Pretty sure!</p>
              <p>The HAIL and FIRE come to a stop. Everything goes dead quiet.<br>
                O'Connell and Evelyn freeze. And then a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM<br>
                is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them.<br>
                O'Connell and Evelyn race up the stairs.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>INT. BURNS' QUARTERS - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell and Evelyn race into the room, past the Servant who<br>
                is running out SCREAMING. They skid to a stop as they spot<br>
                Burns, or what's left of him, lying dead on the floor, --HIS<br>
                BODY IS SHRIVELLED TO HALF IT'S SIZE. Drained of all organs<br>
                and liquids. O'Connell and Evelyn are shocked. Then they hear<br>
                a LOUD MOAN and notice Imhotep standing on the far side of<br>
                the room. O'Connell draws his gun.</p>
              <p>Imhotep is REGENERATING: A thick skin FORMS over powerful new<br>
                musculature. His tendons RIPPLE. His bones BULGE and REFORM.<br>
                His mouth opens to an inhuman size as he MOANS and CRYS OUT,<br>
                in severe pain. And then it's over. And he looks like an<br>
                incredibly muscular, corpse-like vision from hell. The<br>
                'Terminator' Mummy. O'Connell and Evelyn are stunned.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> we are in serious trouble.</p>
              <p>Imhotep starts to move towards them, staring at Evelyn.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Back off, creep</p>
              <p>Imhotep keeps coming. O'Connell OPENS FIRE. BLASTING Imhotep<br>
                Bullets RIP through his body. Imhotep doesn't seem to mind.</p>
              <p>Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels run into the room. They're<br>
                all stunned at the sight of Imhotep.</p>
              <p>O'Connell steps forward, throws a RIGHT HOOK, punches Imhotep<br>
                in the face, --HIS FIST GOES THROUGH IMHOTEPIS SKULL AND GETS<br>
                STUCK DEEP INSIDE HIS HEAD. O'Connell stares at it, shocked,<br>
                then quickly YANKS his fist back out. The area of Imhotep's<br>
                face that came into contact with O'Connell's fist quickly<br>
                DEGENERATES and DECAYS, right down to the bone, as if<br>
                O'Connell's hand instantly infected it.</p>
              <p>Imhotep angrily turns, grabs O'Connell, and with no effort,<br>
                THROWS him across the room and into Jonathan and the others<br>
                knocking them down. Imhotep looks at his hand, the one that<br>
                just grabbed O'Connell, --IT STARTS TO SHRIVEL and DECAY.<br>
                He quickly turns to Evelyn. Evelyn backs away into a wall,<br>
                terrorized. Imhotep steps up to her.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP (subtitled)</p>
              <p> You saved me from the undead.<br>
                For this, I shall make you immortal.</p>
              <p>He leans in, about to kiss her with his decayed face.</p>
              <p>And that's when a WHITE CAT jumps onto the piano, HISSING.<br>
                Imhotep SHRIEKS. The balcony doors BLOW OPEN. Imhotep spins<br>
                into a BLAST OF WIND AND SAND and SWIRLS out the doors. Gone.</p>
              <p><br>
                O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and Daniels stand transfixed.<br>
                Henderson kneels next to Burns, shriveled body, horrified.</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> The curse the curse</p>

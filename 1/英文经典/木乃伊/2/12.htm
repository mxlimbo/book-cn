                INT. CEMETERY - DAY</p>
              <p>Imhotep prepares the altar while speaking in HEBREW. Beni<br>
                holds his gun on her, translating:</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Prince Imhotep wants your heart.</p>
              <p>Evelyn blushes, feeling complimented by the handsome prince.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Tell him, I'm truly flattered.<br>
                ... but that it's already taken.</p>
              <p>Imhotep continues SPEAKING while laying the four jewel<br>
                encrusted canopic jars next to the shattered one.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> He wants your heart and your<br>
                brain, your liver, your kidneys...</p>
              <p>Evelyn's eyes widen</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> ... and how do you say? Those<br>
                slimy things, in your stomach?</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Intestines</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Yeah! Them.</p>
              <p>Evelyn can't believe it, she furiously turns to Imhotep.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> You only want me for my organs?!</p>
              <p>Imhotep looks at her and grins, then BACKHANDS her --WAP!<br>
                Evelyn goes down for the count. Imhotep stares at her, cold,<br>
                malevolent, then h e turns and walks off into the mausoleums.<br>
                Beni nervously glances around, then quickly scurries away.</p>
              <p>TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell squeezes through a small crevice in a wall and<br>
                drops to the floor of a dark chamber. He picks up his gunny-<br>
                sack and scans the darkness. Something GLITTERS. Jonathan and<br>
                Ardeth Bay crawl in behind him.</p>
              <p>O'Connell notices a SHAFT OF LIGHT, high above him, shooting<br>
                through a small hole in the ceiling and stopping against a<br>
                wall next to one of those mirror disks. O'Connell aims his<br>
                gun. FIRES. The bullet STRIKES the disk's pedestal, spinning<br>
                the mirror into the shaft of light, --And WHAM! THE SHAFT OF<br>
                LIGHT HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY BOUNCES AROUND THE ROOM FROM<br>
                ONE DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP.<br>
                It's an enormous TREASURE CHAMBER. Filled to overflowing.<br>
                Everything sparkles and shines. The wealth of Egypt.<br>
                O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay are speechless.<br>
                that's when the two mummified Priest-mummies walk in.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> who the hell are these guys?</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> Priests. Imhotep's priests.</p>
              <p>O'Connell pulls the elephant gun out of his gunny-sack.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I never killed a priest before,</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> They are evil, cursed, they<br>
                matter not.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Well, okay then.</p>
              <p>O'Connell FIRES the elephant gun. SMOKE and FLAME shoot out.<br>
                BLASTS one of the mummies. Blows it's upper torso clean off.</p>
              <p>O'Connell pumps the gun, the huge spent cartridge flips<br>
                through the air. He FIRES again. BLASTS the other mummy,<br>
                b1ows this one's torso clean off as well. The smoke clears.</p>
              <p>The two sets of LEGS keep walking forward, unaffected by the<br>
                loss of their upper torsos. O'Connell can't believe it.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Oh come on, gimme a break here.</p>
              <p>And then the disemboweled upper torsos start to move, turning<br>
                over and crawling towards our heroes, who start to back away.</p>
              <p>INT. CEMETERY -DAY</p>
              <p>Imhotep turns from the altar as he hears more GUNSHOTS<br>
                echoing out of the passageways. He angrily reaches into<br>
                another of Anck-su-namun's canopic jars, pulls out her crusty<br>
                liver and crushes it to dust, then quickly starts reading a<br>
                passage from the Book and BLOWS the dust down a passageway.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP (ancient Egyptian - subtitled)</p>
              <p> Kill them! Kill them all! And<br>
                bring me the Book Of The Living!</p>
              <p>INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>A dusty BREEZE blows into the chamber as O'Connell, Jonathan<br>
                and Ardeth Bay back away from the mummy pieces. The floor<br>
                where they were just standing suddenly STARTS TO MOVE. Two<br>
                more mummies slowly dig their way up out of the floor. More<br>
                mummies start coming out of the walls and crawling out of the<br>
                piles of gold. All the mummies head for our heroes. O'Connell<br>
                lifts the elephant gun. Ardeth Bay stops him.</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> My turn.</p>
              <p>Ardeth Bay OPENS UP with the Lewis gun. BLASTING the shit out<br>
                of the mummies. They keep on coming. Even more now. O'Connell<br>
                OPENS FIRE with the elephant gun, pumping and FIRING as all<br>
                three of the men back away and haul-ass. The mummies and<br>
                mummy pieces follow them into the passageway.</p>
              <p>Then Beni creeps into the chamber. He stares in wonder at all<br>
                the treasure. Then falls backwards into a pile of jewels and<br>
                rolls about.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>INT. CEMETERY - DAY</p>
              <p>Evelyn-wakes up, lying chained to the top of the altar.<br>
                She blink!, then turns her head, --and looks right into<br>
                the ROTTED FACE of Anck-su-namun's corpse. Evelyn SCREAMS.</p>
              <p>INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAYS - DAY</p>
              <p>The elephant gun FIRES, blasting FLAME and SMOKE right into<br>
                the LENS. O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay race down a<br>
                passageway, a dozen mummies striding after them.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> This whole place is comin, alive!</p>
              <p>The men race around a corner. More mummies. They race around<br>
                another corner. More mummies. Onward they come. Methodical.<br>
                Relentless. Boxing in our heroes. O'Connell and Ardeth Bay</p>
              <p>FIRING as they go. Ardeth Bay goes empty.</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> I'm out</p>
              <p>He throws the machine-gun down and they all race into--</p>
              <p>HORUS CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>--A small chamber. The lower half of the giant statue of<br>
                HORUS stands in the middle of the chamber.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> There he is!</p>
              <p>They run up to the base of the statue,</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Hello Horus old boy.</p>
              <p>O'Connell looks back at the mummies coming down the<br>
                passageway. He reaches into his gunny-sack and pulls out<br>
                a stick of dynamite. Ardeth Bay taps him on the shoulder.</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> Allow me.</p>
              <p>O'Connell hands him the dynamite and a match, then turns to<br>
                look at the statue. Ardeth Bay reaches forward and strikes<br>
                the match off O'Connell's stubbly face. O'Connell YELPS.<br>
                Ardeth Bay lights the dynamite and throws it down the<br>
                passageway. They all hit the deck. The dynamite EXPLODES.<br>
                Ripping apart the creatures, causing a CAVE-IN and sealing<br>
                the passageway with rock and dirt. Now there's only one way<br>
                out, --another dark, creepy passageway.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>INT. CEMETERY</p>
              <p>Chained tight to the top of the altar, Evelyn hopelessly<br>
                struggles to free herself. She stops as Priest mummies start<br>
                surrounding the altar. Evelyn is horrified as the hideous<br>
                mummies kneel down and begin to CHANT, --which now sounds<br>
                even more horrific due to the lack of tongues, jaws and<br>
                mouths in the room.</p>
              <p>Imhotep steps up carrying the black Book Of The Dead.<br>
                His hand reaches out and lovingly caresses Anck-su-namun's<br>
                decayed cheek.</p>
              <p>INT. HORUS CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell and Jonathan are digging away at the seams of the<br>
                secret compartment, it starts to give. And that's when Ardeth<br>
                Bay spots another group of rotting mummies coming down the<br>
                dark passageway, heading right for them. O'Connell looks up.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> These guys just don't quit.</p>
              <p>Ardeth Bay grabs the elephant gun and a handful of shells and<br>
                runs off towards the mummies.</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> Keep digging!</p>
              <p>O'Connell and Jonathan redouble their efforts, pulling harder<br>
                on the seam. The compartment starts to loosen. About to give.<br>
                The last time this happened, salt acid sprayed out, remember?<br>
                Our heroes keep tugging. The tension mounts ................</p>
              <p>And that's when a SKELETAL HAND BURSTS UP OUT OF THE GROUND<br>
                and grabs O'Connell's ankle. Several more moldy hands BURST<br>
                up out of the ground. O'Connell and Jonathan struggle with<br>
                the mummies as they crawl up out of the dirt floor.</p>
              <p>One of the mummies violently shoves O'Connell away. Another<br>
                grabs Jonathan by the throat and starts to strangle him. A<br>
                third mummy grabs at the secret compartment and pulls hard.</p>
              <p>AN INTENSE BURST OF ACID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM AND HITS ALL<br>
                THREE OF THE MUMMIES. The one strangling Jonathan gets it in<br>
                the back and drops him. All three mummies melt horribly.</p>
              <p>INT. CEMETERY</p>
              <p>Imhotep begins to read from The Book Of The Dead.</p>
              <p>A large SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog.</p>
              <p>Evelyn's eyes widen in amazement and horror.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>IINT. HORUS CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>Ardeth Bay BLASTS AWAY at the oncoming mummies.<br>
                over at the base of the statue, O'Connell and Jonathan pull<br>
                an ornate chest out of the secret compartment. O'Connell rips<br>
                off the lid, reaches inside and pulls out a heavy burlap bag.</p>
              <p>He and Jonathan exchange nervous, excited looks. Then he<br>
                reaches into the bag and slowly pulls out the SOLID GOLD Book<br>
                Of The Living- GOLDEN LIGHT reflects off their faces as they<br>
                stare at it in wonder.</p>
              <p>The elephant gun goes empty. Ardeth Bay takes it by the<br>
                barrel and wades into the remaining mummies swinging.</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> Save the girl! Kill the creature!</p>
              <p>The mummies quickly overwhelm and start to tear him apart.<br>
                O'Connell lights the last stick of dynamite and throws it<br>
                against the far wall. He and Jonathan hit the deck.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> That's the last one, we better<br>
                get lucky.</p>
              <p>The wall BLOWS. Debris COLLAPSES, --but now here's a hole for<br>
                them to get out. O'Connell and Jonathan race out through the<br>
                hole just as the remaining mummies enter the chamber.</p>
              <p>EXT. HAMUNAPTRA RUINS - DAY</p>
              <p>Outside, Beni staggers across the sand with a saddlebag<br>
                filled with treasure. He throws it over the rear of a camel.<br>
                Starts to climb up. Hesitates. Looks back at the temple door.<br>
                Licks his lips. And then his greed gets the better of him and<br>
                he quickly climbs down and scurries back towards the door.</p>

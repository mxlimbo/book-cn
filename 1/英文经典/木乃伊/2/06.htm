                EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Jonathan falls into FRAME. Hits the ground. Eyes wide open.<br>
                Mouth agape. Clearly dead. A BEAT. And then his eyes close<br>
                and his mouth widens into a goofy smile. Shit-faced drunk.<br>
                O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves,<br>
                the bottle of Seagrams is almost gone. O'Connell offers the<br>
                bottle to Evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly--</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Unlike my brother, sir, I know<br>
                when to say no.</p>
              <p>O'Connell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Unlike your brother, Miss, you<br>
                I don't get. You're a whole new brew.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> I know, you're wondering, what's<br>
                a place like me doing in a girl<br>
                like this?</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Something like that.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Egypt is in my blood. My father<br>
                was a famous explorer, he loved<br>
                Egypt so much that he married<br>
                an Egyptian my mother! who<br>
                was quite an adventurer herself</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Okay, I get your father, I get<br>
                your mother and I get your brother,<br>
                but what are you doing here?</p>
              <p>Evelyn is insulted, she staggers to her feet.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> I may not be an explorer, or an<br>
                adventurer, or a treasure hunter,<br>
                or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell<br>
                But I'm proud of what I am.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> And what is that?</p>
              <p>Evelyn plops back down beside him, really drunk, she grins<br>
                and proudly lifts her head high.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> ..... am a librarian!</p>
              <p>She leans in, very close to his face, looks him in the eyes,</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> I'm going to kiss you, Mister<br>
                O'Connell.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> No you're not.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> I'm not?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Not unless you call me Rick</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Why would I do that?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Because that's my name.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>She gives him a goofy smile. He leans forward and KISSES HER.<br>
                Evelyn's eyes slowly close. And then she passes out, slumping<br>
                into his arms. O'Connell looks down at her, and just smiles.</p>
              <p>INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>Evelyn's HAND slips the KEY into the sarcophagus, lock and<br>
                turns it. A series of STRANGE MECHANICAL-LIKE SOUNDS are<br>
                heard, and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a GIANT HISS.<br>
                O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan all look very, very hungover.</p>
              <p>They start to slide the heavy lid off the sarcophagus.<br>
                PUSHING, SHOVING and GROANING, the lid budging, inch by inch.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> .I can't believe I allowed the<br>
                two of you to get me drunk.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Don't blame me, I don't even<br>
                remember being there.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> well neither do I, thank you.</p>
              <p>O'Connell gives her a hurt look.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> You don't?</p>
              <p>Evelyn gives O'Connell a nervous look.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> No . .... Why? .... Should I?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Gee, yeah, you told me it was<br>
                the best time you ever had.</p>
              <p>O'Connell gives her a big cheesy smile. Evelyn's face drops,<br>
                appalled and embarrassed. And that's when the lid FALLS OFF<br>
                and LOUDLY CRASHES to the ground. All three of them instantly<br>
                grab their sore heads and MOAN.</p>
              <p>INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>Several fear-filled, sweaty-faced Diggers reach into the<br>
                secret compartment. Henderson and Burns hold guns on them.<br>
                Daniels has his arm in a sling. The Diggers slowly pull out<br>
                the ORNATE CHEST. They set the chest down on the sandy floor.<br>
                Beni watches as the Egyptologist translates the hieratics.</p>
              <p> EGYPTOLOGIST</p>
              <p> There is a curse upon this chest.</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> Curse My ass.</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> Yeah, who cares.</p>
              <p>The Egyptologist gives them the evil-eye</p>
              <p> EGYPTOLOGIST</p>
              <p> In these hallowed grounds, that<br>
                which was set forth in ancient<br>
                times, is as strong today, as<br>
                it was then.</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> Yeah, yeah, okay, what's it</p>
              <p>The Egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription:</p>
              <p> EGYPTOLOGIST</p>
              <p> &quot;Death will come on swift wings<br>
                to whomever opens this chest&quot;.</p>
              <p>A GUST OF WIND blows through the chamber. TORCHES FLICKER<br>
                All-the Diggers suddenly turn tail and run off SCREAMING.<br>
                The Americans look at each other, suddenly very nervous.</p>
              <p> EGYPTOLOGIST</p>
              <p> It says, there is one, the undead,<br>
                who if brought back to life, is<br>
                bound by sacred law to consummate<br>
                this curse.</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> Yeah, well, let's just make sure<br>
                we don't bring anybody back from<br>
                the dead then, huh?<br>
                The three Americans laugh.</p>
              <p> EGYPTOLOGIST</p>
              <p> He will kill all who open this<br>
                chest, ...and assimilate their<br>
                organs and fluids.</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> Assimilate their organs and fluids?<br>
                Ya mean eat 'em?</p>
              <p> EGYPTOLOGIST</p>
              <p> And in so doing he will regenerate.<br>
                And no longer be the undead, but a<br>
                plague upon this earth.</p>
              <p><br>
                The WIND WHISTLES. Torches FLICKER. VERY SPOOKY. Beni and the<br>
                Egyptologist share a fear-filled look. Henderson just shrugs.</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> Ah hell, let's open it anyways,</p>
              <p>INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>WHAM! Imhotep's wooden coffin is DROPPED to the ground next<br>
                to his stone sarcophagus. Evelyn is very excited.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Oh my god, love dreamed about<br>
                this ever since I was a little girl.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> You dream about dead guys?</p>
              <p>Evelyn just gives him a look, then starts brushing dirt and<br>
                cobwebs off the top of the coffin. Then she freezes.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Look, all the sacred spells have<br>
                been chiseled off. The hieratics<br>
                and hieroglyphs that protect the<br>
                deceased on his journey into the<br>
                afterlife, they've been removed.<br>
                This man was cursed, ....doomed.</p>
              <p>O'Connell and Jonathan are too excited to care</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Tough break.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Yes, I'm all tears, now let's<br>
                see who's inside, shall we?</p>
              <p>Evelyn can't believe these guys. Jonathan inserts the key/box<br>
                into the coffin's lock. Turns it. The lid cracks open with a<br>
                HISS. They all react to the FOUL STENCH. Then O'Connell grabs<br>
                the lid. It's stuck. He pulls with all his might. Jonathan<br>
                helps him. It starts to give way. Slowly. Slowly. Slooooowly.<br>
                And then it suddenly POPS OPEN and THE MOST HIDEOUS, MAGGOT-<br>
                INFESTED, ROTTEN CORPSE IMAGINABLE JUMPS UP!</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL/EVELYN/JONATHAN</p>
              <p> AHHHHH!!!</p>
              <p>They all jump back. Scared to death. Imhotep is now the<br>
                'Elephant Man' of corpses; twisted and deformed. The years<br>
                have not been kind. He slumps back into his coffin.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>INT. ANUBIS'-CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>Henderson and Daniels start to pry at the lid of the wooden<br>
                chest. Beni and the Egyptologist watch. In the background,<br>
                Beni starts backing away, filled with fear, sweating buckets.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> The curse, ....beware the curse!</p>
              <p>turns and bolts from the chamber. Daniels spits.</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> Stupid superstitious bastard.</p>
              <p>And that's when the seal breaks, --A BLACK VAPOR BLASTS OUT<br>
                OF THE CHEST. Everybody vanishes into the strange cloud.</p>
              <p>INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan slowly creep forward and<br>
                carefully look back inside Imhotep's coffin, creeped-out</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> is he supposed to look like that?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> No. I've never seen a mummy look<br>
                like this. He's, he's still...<br>
                <br>
                JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Juicy?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Yes. He's more than four thousand<br>
                years old and still decomposing.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> And look at this.</p>
              <p>O'Connell points at the inside of the COFFIN LID, where there<br>
                are FINGERNAIL SCRATCHES and DRIED BLOOD all over the inside.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Oh my god, he was buried alive,</p>
              <p>This sends a chill through everyone. Evelyn leans in closer,</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> And he left a message.</p>
              <p>WE PUSH IN on a grouping of hieratics WRITTEN IN BLOOD.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> It says: 'Death is only the beginning*</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Jonathan shivers. O'Connell looks around.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Where's my gun?</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> What are you going to do?<br>
                Shoot him?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> If he decides to wakes up, hell yes!</p>
              <p>INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>The vapor is settling. The Americans have their guns aimed at<br>
                the chest. The Egyptologist slowly steps up, reaches inside,<br>
                and lifts out a heavy burlap bag. Everyone's eyes widen in<br>
                excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and slowly<br>
                pulls out the black BOOK OF THE DEAD, the same book Imhotep<br>
                used in his attempt to bring Anck-su-namun back to life.</p>
              <p> EGYPTOLOGIST</p>
              <p> I have heard told of this book,<br>
                but I never truly believed it<br>
                existed. This, good gentlemen,<br>
                is a most priceless treasure.</p>
              <p>Henderson kicks the sandy floor in anger.</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> I wouldn't trade ya for a brass<br>
                spittoon!</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> Yeah! It's supposed to be made<br>
                outta pure gold!</p>
              <p>Daniels kicks the chest. it breaks open, unfolding to reveal<br>
                a lower compartment. Inside, are Anck-su-namun's FIVE JEWEL<br>
                ENCRUSTED CANOPIC JARS (one is shattered and without jewels)</p>
              <p>EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT</p>
              <p>The two camps have now joined together. O'Connell and Beni<br>
                are roasting chunks of hairy meat over a fire. Jonathan<br>
                wrinkles his nose, disgusted by the smell.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> What is this stuff? It smells<br>
                like our late friend, the warden.</p>
              <p>O'Connell and Beni both grin. Jonathan looks horrified.</p>
              <p><br>
                JONATHAN</p>
              <p> You did not!? .... We're not!?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Rat gizzards. They smell bad<br>
                and taste worse, but that's the<br>
                best the desert has to offer.</p>
              <p>The gloating Americans sit down, fondling their jeweled jars.</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> Say O'Connell, whadaya think<br>
                these honey's'll fetch back home?</p>
              <p> BURNS</p>
              <p> we hear you gentlemen found yerselves<br>
                a nice gooey mummy. Congratulations.</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> Ya know if ya dry him out, you<br>
                can sell him for firewood.</p>
              <p>The Americans laugh. Evelyn walks up, sits down and drops a<br>
                pile of big dusty BUG SKELETONS onto the ground.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Scarabs, flesh eaters, I found<br>
                them inside our friend's coffin.<br>
                They can stay alive for years<br>
                living off the flesh of a corpse,<br>
                or in this case ........</p>
              <p>She shrugs, then looks at the roasting meat</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> famished.</p>
              <p>O'Connell and Jonathan stare at the bug skeletons, disgusted.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Are you saying somebody threw<br>
                these things in with our guy,<br>
                and they slowly ate him alive?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Very slowly.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> He certainly was not a popular<br>
                fellow when they planted him.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Must of got a little too frisky<br>
                with the Pharaoh's daughter.</p>
              <p><br>
                EVELYN</p>
              <p> According to my readings, our<br>
                friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the<br>
                worst of all ancient Egyptian<br>
                curses, one reserved for only<br>
                the most evil blasphemers. In<br>
                all of my research, I've never<br>
                read of this curse actually<br>
                having been performed.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> That bad huh?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Yes, they never used it because<br>
                they feared it so. it's written,<br>
                that if a victim of the HOM-DAI<br>
                should ever arise, he would bring<br>
                with him the ten plagues of Egypt.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> The ten plagues? ... You mean all <br>
                ten plagues.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Like what that Moses guy did<br>
                to that Pharaoh guy?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> That's one way of putting it.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Let's see, there was frogs, flies,<br>
                locusts....</p>
              <p> BURNS</p>
              <p> Hail and fire.</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> The sun turning black.</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> Water turning to blood.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> And my personal favorite: people<br>
                covered in boils and sores.</p>
              <p>All the men share nervous looks, really spooked. Evelyn just<br>
                laughs at them, then pulls a meat stick out of the fire.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Fried gizzard anyone?</p>

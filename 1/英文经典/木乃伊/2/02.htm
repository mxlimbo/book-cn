                EXT. RIDGE - DAY</p>
              <p>Up on a ridge, A GROUP OF RIDERS watch O'Connell stumble clear 
                of the<br>
                decrepit city. O'Connell feels their presence and looks up. Very 
                different<br>
                from the Tuaregs, they have BLUE TINTED SKIN and faces covered 
                in strange<br>
                PUZZLE-TATTOOS. The Mumia. Still watching Imhotep's grave after 
                all this<br>
                time.</p>
              <p>The MUMIA LEADER is a huge, fierce Man in black robes, with dual 
                scimitars<br>
                across his waist. His face is both handsome and horrible, blue 
                and<br>
                tattooed. Meet ARDETH BAY. His dark eyes watch O'Connell stagger 
                off into<br>
                the open desert ........</p>
              <p>EXT. CAIRO - DAY</p>
              <p>Cairo, a city so old the stars have actually changed their positions 
                in the<br>
                sky since it's birth. A city teeming with every form of life. 
                A strange,<br>
                mysterious, wonderful city. WE SUPERIMPOSE it's name across the 
                SCREEN:<br>
                CAIRO</p>
              <p>INT. CAIRO MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY</p>
              <p>Deep in the bowels of the museum lie the STACKS. Rows upon rows 
                of towering<br>
                bookshelves. Filled with literature on the Antiquities. Standing 
                at the top<br>
                of a tall ladder between two of these rows and leaning against 
                one of the<br>
                bookshelves, is a rather uninteresting British GIRL: eye-glasses,<br>
                hair-in-a-bun, long boring dress, your typical prudish nightmare. 
                This is<br>
                EVELYN CARNARVON. We're going to fall in love with her.</p>
              <p>Evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm, blows the 
                dust off it,<br>
                then places it on a shelf with other books whose titles all begin 
                with the<br>
                letter &quot;O&quot;. Then she grabs another book out from under 
                her arm and reads<br>
                the title.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> Tuthmosis? .... Now how did you get up here?</p>
              <p>Carefully, so as not to lose her balance, she looks over her 
                shoulder to<br>
                the bookshelf behind her, where all the titles begin with the 
                letter 'TO.<br>
                Then she looks down. It's a long way to the bottom. Evelyn gently 
                sets the<br>
                other books down on the top shelf, then turns and gingerly starts 
                to reach<br>
                across the aisle with the Tuthmosis book. It's a little too far, 
                so she<br>
                stretches, reaching, holding the top of the ladder with<br>
                her fingertips, she's almost got it, closer now closer.</p>
              <p>And that's when the ladder pulls away from the shelf. Evelyn 
                YELPS, flings<br>
                the Tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the ladder, which stands 
                straight<br>
                up. Evelyn holds her breath, swaying precariously, a long BEAT, 
                and then<br>
                she loses her balance, the ladder swings around and Evelyn starts<br>
                stiltwalking down the aisle.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> OHEIUGM! ! AHHHHHH!</p>
              <p>The ladder crosses the aisle, does an about face and heads back 
                the way it<br>
                came. Evelyn clings to the top, struggling for balance. The ladder 
                teeters<br>
                out into the main aisle and picks up speed. Evelyn SCREAMS as 
                it does a<br>
                180, spins into another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at 
                the top of a<br>
                bookshelf. Evelyn holds her breath, then SIGHS HEAVILY.</p>
              <p>And that's when the bookshelf falls away from her and CRASHES 
                into the next<br>
                bookshelf. Evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor. 
                She looks<br>
                up just as the domino effect kicks-in: each bookshelf crashing 
                into the<br>
                next. And onward it goes. Bookshelf after bookshelf. Thousands 
                of volumes<br>
                flinging off shelves and scattering across the floor. It finally 
                ends as<br>
                the last shelf CRASHES into a wall. Evelyn's eyes are closed. 
                She opens one<br>
                eye. Looks left. Then right. Then opens the other eye and stares 
                at the<br>
                huge mess.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> Oops.</p>
              <p>The Egyptian CURATOR storms in.</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> Look at this! Sons of the Messiah! Give <br>
                me frogs, flies, locusts, Anything but this! <br>
                Compared to you, the other plagues were a joy!</p>
              <p>Evelyn quickly gets up and starts gathering books.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> I'm sorry, it was an accident.</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an <br>
                accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I <br>
                put up with you?</p>
              <p>Evelyn turns to him, trying to contain herself.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> You put up with me, because I can read and <br>
                write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs <br>
                and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a<br>
                thousand miles who knows how to properly code <br>
                and catalogue this library.</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> Who needs smart women? I put up with you because <br>
                your mother and father were our finest patrons, <br>
                Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this<br>
                mess!</p>
              <p>The Curator storms out. Evelyn just stands there, steaming. And 
                then she<br>
                hears a NOISE and quickly turns around. A BEAT.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> Hello?</p>
              <p>Quiet. Eerie. And then she hears it again, like feet, slowly 
                shuffling<br>
                across the floor, coming from a nearby gallery.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Abdul? Mohammed? Bob?</p>
              <p>Evelyn walks through the stacks and enters--</p>
              <p>INT. THE RAMESSEUM</p>
              <p>Filled with treasures and plunder from the Middle Kingdom. it's 
                very dark<br>
                and quiet in here, the only LIGHT is from FLICKERING TORCHES at 
                either end<br>
                of the spooky gallery.</p>
              <p>The NOISE again! From the far side of the room. Feet, slowly 
                shuffling,<br>
                plodding across the floor. Evelyn grabs a torch. Looks around,-at 
                a statue<br>
                of Anubis, another of Horus, they stare down at Evelyn, who is 
                starting to<br>
                get scared now. She walks down the aisle. Past a closed sarcophagus. 
                Past<br>
                cases of ancient artifacts. Past another sarcophagus, --only this 
                one is<br>
                OPEN! Evelyn freezes, swallows hard, nervously looks around to 
                see who<br>
                could have opened it. Then she slowly leans forward with the torch, 
                and<br>
                peers inside.</p>
              <p>--A hideous rotted MUMMY sits up and SCREECHES at her! Evelyn<br>
                SCREAMS, drops the torch and backs away, scared out of her wits. 
                And then,<br>
                coming from inside the sarcophagus, she hears a Man LAUGHING. 
                Her eyes<br>
                narrow as a foppish cad crawls out from behind the Mummy, laughing 
                his ass<br>
                off, half drunk.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> You... ! YOU... !</p>
              <p> JONATHAN </p>
              <p> Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call <br>
                me something original.</p>
              <p>Meet JONATHAN CARNARVON. As he crawls out of the sarcophagus, 
                Evelyn pulls<br>
                a cigarette out of the mummy's mouth.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> Have you no respect for the dead?</p>
              <p> JONATHAN </p>
              <p> Right now, I only wish to join them.</p>
              <p>He grins drunkenly. Evelyn punches him hard in the chest.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than <br>
                later, before you ruin my<br>
                career the way you've ruined yours.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN </p>
              <p> My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you <br>
                know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.</p>
              <p>He BELCHES, then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> High note? Ha! For five years you've been <br>
                scrounging around Egypt, and what have you <br>
                to show for it? Nothing.</p>
              <p>Jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN </p>
              <p> oh yes I do! I have something right here!</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> Oh no, not another worthless trinket, <br>
                Jonathan, if I bring one more<br>
                piece of junk to the Curator to try <br>
                and sell for you.</p>
              <p>Jonathan pulls out a small, ancient BOX; the collapsed KEY to 
                Imhotep's<br>
                sarcophagus and coffin. Evelyn is instantly curious, she grabs 
                the box out<br>
                of his hand.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> Where did you get this?</p>
              <p>Jonathan knows her weaknesses, gives her a mischievous smile.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN </p>
              <p> On a dig, down in Thebes</p>
              <p>Evelyn rolls the box around in her hands, mumbling to herself 
                as she<br>
                translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it. Jonathan 
                licks his<br>
                lips in anticipation.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN </p>
              <p> My whole life I've never found<br>
                anything, Evy Tell me I've<br>
                found something.</p>
              <p>Evelyn's fingers play with the various little slats on the box, 
                shifting<br>
                them this way and that way, it's like a puzzle box. Then suddenly, 
                it<br>
                UNFOLDS ITSELF, almost-mechanically, turning itself into the KEY. 
                Sitting<br>
                inside the open key/box is a folded piece of GOLDEN PAPYRUS. An 
                ANCIENT<br>
                MAP.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> Jonathan?</p>
              <p> JONATHAN </p>
              <p> Yes?</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> I think you found something.</p>
              <p>INT. CURATOR'S OFFICE - DAY</p>
              <p>The Curator sits at his desk, staring through a jeweler's eyepiece 
                at the key/box. Evelyn hovers behind him, excited.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> See the cartouche there, it's the official <br>
                royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> Perhaps</p>
              <p>Jonathan leans in from across the desk.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN </p>
              <p> Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? <br>
                And was he rich?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, <br>
                said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN </p>
              <p> Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, <br>
                like him very much.</p>
              <p>The Curator picks up the MAP. It's actually the exact same map 
                that we<br>
                established in the opening scenes of the movie.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> I've already dated it, this map<br>
                is almost four thousand years old.</p>
              <p> And the hieratics over here....</p>
              <p> (Inhales deeply)</p>
              <p> It's Hamunaptra.</p>
              <p>The Curator freezes, suddenly very nervous, then he recovers</p>
              <p> CURATOR </p>
              <p> My dear girl, don't be ridiculous, <br>
                we are scholars, not treasure<br>
                hunters. Hamunaptra is a myth.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN </p>
              <p> Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early <br>
                Pharaohs were said to have<br>
                hidden the wealth of Egypt.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN </p>
              <p> Right, right, in a big underground treasure <br>
                chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire <br>
                necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On<br>
                Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the <br>
                whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> All we know is that the city mysteriously <br>
                vanished around 2,134 B.C.</p>
              <p>The Curator holds the map closer to the burning CANDLE-LAMP.</p>
              <p> CURATOR </p>
              <p> As the Americans would say: it's all fairy <br>
                tales and hokum.</p>
              <p>The map 'accidentally,' CATCHES ON FIRE. The Curator throws it 
                to the<br>
                floor. Jonathan drops to his knees and quickly puts it out. Lifts 
                it up.<br>
                The left third of the map is now missing.</p>
              <p> JONATHM </p>
              <p> You burned it! You burned off the part with the lost city!</p>
              <p> CURATOR </p>
              <p> It's for the best, I'm sure. Many men have <br>
                wasted their lives in the foolish pursuit of <br>
                Hamunaptra, no one has ever found it, most have<br>
                never returned.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN (devastated) </p>
              <p> You killed my map.</p>
              <p> CURATOR </p>
              <p> I'm sure it was a fake, anyway, I'm <br>
                surprised at you, Miss<br>
                Carnarvon, to be so fooled.</p>
              <p>The Curator reaches for the key/box. Evelyn quickly snatches 
                it off the<br>
                desk and gives him a very angry, suspicious look.</p>
              <p>EXT. CAIRO PRISON - GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY</p>
              <p>Cairo prison. One of the worst hell holes on earth. Every low-life 
                form of<br>
                scumbag can be found here. The WARDEN, a first rate scumbag himself,<br>
                escorts Evelyn and Jonathan across the gallows courtyard. Evelyn 
                whispers<br>
                to Jonathan.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!</p>
              <p> JONATHAN </p>
              <p> I was mistaken.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> lied to me!</p>
              <p> JONATHM </p>
              <p> I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> I'm your sister.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN </p>
              <p> That just makes you more gullible.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!</p>
              <p> JONATHAN </p>
              <p> Picked his pocket, actually</p>
              <p>EXT. VISITORIS PEN - DAY</p>
              <p>The Warden ushers Evelyn and Jonathan into the holding pen.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> and what is he in prison for?</p>
              <p> WARDEN </p>
              <p> I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, <br>
                I asked him that myself.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> And what did he say?</p>
              <p> WARDEN </p>
              <p> He said,....he was just looking for a good time.</p>
              <p>The interior cell door BURSTS OPEN. O'Connell is in chains, dragged 
                by FOUR<br>
                GUARDS, they shove him up to the cell bars. From the looks of 
                it, he's been<br>
                here awhile; his face is half hidden by long hair, a scraggly 
                beard and<br>
                many new bruises. Evelyn looks at him, disgusted by his appearance.</p>
              <p> EVELYN </p>
              <p> But he's just a filthy criminal?</p>
              <p> JONATHAN (cringing)</p>
              <p> Way to go, Evy.</p>
              <p>O'Connell gives Evelyn the once over, then looks at Jonathan.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> So who's the broad?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Broad?!</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> She's my sister, actually.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Yeah? Well, ....I'm sure she's<br>
                not a total loss.</p>
              <p>Evelyn is stunned and furious. The Warden heads out the door.</p>
              <p> WARDEN </p>
              <p> I'll be back in a moment.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL (sarcastic)</p>
              <p> I tremble with anticipation.</p>
              <p>A Guard CLUBS O'Connell across the head, O'Connell's face bounces 
                off the<br>
                metal bars. He shows no pain, but just looks back and gives the 
                Guard a<br>
                nasty look. Evelyn steps closer.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> We uh,...found .... your puzzle box,<br>
                and we've come to ask you about it.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL </p>
              <p> No.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> No?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> No. ...You came to ask me about<br>
                Hamunaptra.</p>
              <p>Evelyn and Jonathan quickly look around, hoping the guards didn't 
                hear him.<br>
                They step closer. Evelyn plays coy.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> How do you know the box pertains<br>
                to Hamunaptra?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Because that's where I found it.<br>
                I was there.</p>
              <p>Evelyn is dumbstruck. But Jonathan looks suspicious</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> How do we know that's not a<br>
                load of pig swallow?</p>
              <p>O'Connell looks closer at Jonathan, a glint of recognition.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Hey,....don't I know you?</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Um, well, you see....</p>
              <p>O'Connell's FIST comes flying through the bars, hits Jonathan 
                square in the<br>
                jaw, DECKS HIM. He hits the floor. Out cold. A Guard CLUBS O'Connell. 
                His<br>
                head bounces off the bars again. He shows no pain, but gives the 
                Guard<br>
                another nasty look. Evelyn looks down at her brother, then back 
                at<br>
                O'Connell.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> You were actually at Hamunaptra?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I just decked your brother</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Yes, well, (shrugs) I know my brother.</p>
              <p>O'Connell almost smiles. There's a bit of spark to this girl.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Yeah, I was there.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> You swear?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Every damn day</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> No, I mean--</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> --I know what you mean. I was<br>
                there, alright. Seti's place.<br>
                The City Of The Dead.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> What did you find? What did you see?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I found sand. I saw death.</p>
              <p>The warden enters. Evelyn quickly leans closer to O'Connell.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Could you tell me how to get<br>
                there? The exact location?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL </p>
              <p> Want to know?</p>
              <p>Evelyn leans in even closer</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Yes.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL </p>
              <p> Really want to know?</p>
              <p>She leans her face right up to the bars, nervous and excited</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Yes.</p>
              <p>O'Connell steps forward and KISSES her full on the lips.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Then get me the hell outta here</p>
              <p>Evelyn is stunned. A Guard CLUBS him, his face bounces off the 
                bars again,<br>
                but before he can react the Guards GRAB him, YANK him away from 
                the bars<br>
                and DRAG him out of the room.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Where are they taking him?</p>
              <p> WARDEN</p>
              <p> To be hanged.</p>
              <p>Evelyn is shocked. The warden shows-off his green teeth</p>
              <p> WARDEN</p>
              <p> Apparently, he had a very good time,</p>

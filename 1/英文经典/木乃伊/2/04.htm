              <p><br>
                INT. EVELYN'S CABIN - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Evelyn, wearing a nightgown, stands in front of a mirror. She<br>
                gives her head a good shake, letting her hair fall loose over<br>
                her bare shoulders. Then she turns around, RIGHT<br>
                THERE IS ONE OF THE HIDEOUS MUMIA! It's Hook. He slams his<br>
                hand over her mouth and lifts up his hook, ready to strike.</p>
              <p> HOOK</p>
              <p> Where is the map?</p>
              <p>Evelyn's terrified eyes glance down. Hook looks over, sees<br>
                the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table,</p>
              <p> HOOK</p>
              <p> And the key? Where is the key?</p>
              <p>Evelyn's eyes look confused. She shakes her head. Hook grins,</p>
              <p> HOOK</p>
              <p> Then I'll find it myself,</p>
              <p>He cocks his hook, about to kill her. And that's when the<br>
                door is KICKED OPEN. O'Connell BURSTS IN, gun in each hand.<br>
                Hook spins Evelyn around and holds her out in front of him.<br>
                O'Connell looks at her.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Friend of yours?</p>
              <p>Evelyn's eyes widen. And that's when the candle on the table<br>
                FLICKERS. Everything happens at once, READ FAST: O'Connell<br>
                spins around just as a window BURSTS OPEN. A Mumia leans in.<br>
                FIRES A GUN. Woodchips BLAST OFF the wall next to O'Connell's<br>
                head. He returns FIRE. Kills the Mumia. The Mumia falls back.</p>
              <p>FIRING BLINDLY.-A LANTERN in the room is BLASTED. Kerosene<br>
                SPLASHES across the wall. BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Evelyn grabs<br>
                the candle on the table and JAMS IT back over her shoulder,<br>
                right into Hook's EYE. He SCREECHES in pain and lets her go.<br>
                O'Connell grabs her and YANKS her out of the FLAMING ROOM.</p>
              <p>HALLWAY - NIGHT</p>
              <p>O'Connell pulls Evelyn down the hall, she tries to jerk free.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> The map! We need the map!</p>
              <p>He shoves her up against a wall.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Relax! I'm the map!<br>
                (taps his forehead)<br>
                It's all up here.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Oh that's comforting.</p>
              <p>O'Connell gives her a look, then pulls her forward</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> C'mon, there's still one more of<br>
                those guys around here somewhere.</p>
              <p>EVELYN'S FLAMING ROOM - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Hot melted wax covers Hook's face as he holds his sore eye<br>
                and struggles to the door. Then he notices the key/box on the<br>
                floor. He bends over to pick it up. And that's when the door<br>
                is KICKED OPEN again, it hits him in the ass and knocks him<br>
                into the fire. Jonathan leans in. Sees nothing but flames.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> EVY!!</p>
              <p>Then he sees the key/box on the floor and picks it up,<br>
                A HAND suddenly snatches the key/box away from him.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Hey that's mine---</p>
              <p>it's Hook. His backside is now ON FIRE. He lifts his pistol.<br>
                Jonathan quickly backpedals out the door as Hook OPENS FIRE.</p>
              <p>EXT. CAMEL PADDOCK - NIGHT</p>
              <p>O'Connell and Evelyn race out onto the deck near the horse<br>
                paddock. People are SCREAMING and SHOUTING, lots of panic.<br>
                BLAM! A chunk of the wall is BLOWN OFF next to Evelyn's head.<br>
                O'Connell pivots and FIRES BACK. It's the last Mumia, on the<br>
                other side of the paddock. He and O'Connell exchange GUNFIRE.</p>
              <p>Another LANTERN BURSTS INTO FLAMES. O'Connell SHOOTS OFF the<br>
                paddock lock. The horses go nuts. O'Connell FIRES over their<br>
                heads. They CHARGE FORWARD and CRASH through the door. The<br>
                Mumia SCREAMS as the horses STAMPEDE over him. FLAMES sweep<br>
                up the walls and race across the roof. Half the barge is now<br>
                ON FIRE. O'Connell throws the gunny-sack over his shoulder.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Can you swim?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> well of course I can swim, if<br>
                the occasion calls for it.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Trust me,</p>
              <p>He picks her up and throws her over the side</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> The occasion calls for it.</p>
              <p>Evelyn SPLASHES into the water. O'Connell dives in after her.</p>
              <p>EXT. BARGE BOW - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Jonathan runs out onto the bow, sees the three Americans,<br>
                guns in every hand, fanning their pistols, SHOOTING<br>
                everything in sight. Jonathan just shakes his head.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Americans.</p>
              <p>Hook suddenly stumbles up behind him, --now a FLAMING TORCH.<br>
                Jonathan turns around, Hook grabs him by the throat with his<br>
                FLAMING ARM and pins him to the cabin wall. Jonathan's eyes<br>
                widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the FLAMES about to<br>
                strike him. The Americans pivot and OPEN FIRE. Blow Hook over<br>
                the railing. Jonathan turns to the Americans and smiles.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> I say! Good show!</p>
              <p>Then he points his thumb at himself</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> And did I panic?</p>
              <p>He lifts up his other hand, --he has the key/box back.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> I think not.</p>
              <p>And that's when the horses STAMPEDE onto the bow. Jonathan<br>
                dives over one side, the three Americans dive over the other.</p>
              <p>NILE RIVERBANK - NIGHT</p>
              <p>O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden wade out of the<br>
                water. Evelyn's nightgown clings tight to her body as she<br>
                wrings it out. She looks good. O'Connell notices. Everybody<br>
                else, including the horses, is getting out on the far shore<br>
                O'Connell spots Beni running up to the Americans.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Hey O'Connell! Looks to me<br>
                like I got all the horses!</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Hey Beni! Looks to me like your<br>
                on the wrong side of the river!</p>
              <p>Beni looks up at the stars, then angrily KICKS the sand<br>
                CURSING. The FLAMING barge drifts off, slowly sinking ........</p>
              <p>BEDOUIN TRADING POST - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell barters in ARABIC with a CAMEL TRADER at a trading<br>
                post. Jonathan forks over some cash. The Trader hands them<br>
                the reins of four ugly old camels.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> I can't believe the price of<br>
                these fleabags.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> We coulda had 'em for free, all<br>
                we had to do was give 'em your sister.</p>
              <p><br>
                JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Awfully.</p>
              <p>And that's when Evelyn steps out of a trading tent. She's<br>
                changed into a gorgeous, tightly fitted, Bedouin dress.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Then again....</p>
              <p>SAHARA DESERT SAND DUNES - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the warden are on camels in<br>
                the middle of the frying pan; the endless, sunbaked Sahara.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Never did like camels. Filthy<br>
                buggers. They smell, they bite,<br>
                they spit. Disgusting.</p>
              <p>The warden savagely attacks a chicken wing with his vile<br>
                green teeth. Flies buzz around his head. He sucks at his<br>
                gums, then spits out some gristle. O'Connell watches him.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Yeah, disgusting.</p>
              <p>Evelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Well I think they're cute.</p>
              <p>WE DO SEVERAL TIME DISSOLVES: showing the majesty of the<br>
                desert, and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it.</p>
              <p>FRYING PAN - NIGHT</p>
              <p>The MOON shines down an four lone camel rider's trekking<br>
                across the vast wasteland.</p>
              <p>Jonathan is sound asleep, his head bobbing comically to<br>
                the rhythm of his camel. on the camel next to him, the<br>
                Warden SNORES LOUDLY. Up in front of them, Evelyn slowly<br>
                starts to slide off her saddle. O'Connell reaches over and<br>
                stops her, then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle,<br>
                never waking her. For a long moment, his eyes watch Evelyn,<br>
                and then he looks up at a distant ridge--</p>
              <p>--where Ardeth Bay and a group of MUMIA RIDERS are pacing them.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>EXT. GIANT SAND DUNE - ENDLESS HORIZON - DAY</p>
              <p>The dawning sun hasn't yet crested the distant horizon as<br>
                Jonathan and the Warden ride alongside a giant sand dune.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> And you snore!</p>
              <p> WARDEN</p>
              <p> I do not snore!</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> All night you snored!</p>
              <p> WARDEN</p>
              <p> I have never snored!</p>
              <p>Up in front of them, O'Connell looks at Evelyn.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> We're almost there.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Are you sure?</p>
              <p>O'Connell looks down at the ground.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Pretty sure.</p>
              <p>The others look down and see DOZENS OF SKELETONS sticking out<br>
                of the ground. Bleached and eaten away. Some of the skeletons<br>
                look like they're trying to crawl up out of the desert floor.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> what in bloody hell is this?</p>
              <p>The Warden shivers in fear.</p>
              <p> WARDEN</p>
              <p> Other seekers of Hamunaptra.</p>
              <p>The American Expedition rides out from behind the far end of<br>
                the dune. The Americans are accompanied by TWO DOZEN NATIVE<br>
                DIGGERS and an Arab EGYPTOLOGIST. Beni rides lead on a camel,<br>
                the rest ride horses.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Good morning, my friend!</p>
              <p>O'Connell just nods. The two parties come to a stop a hundred<br>
                feet apart. O'Connell turns and stares out across the endless<br>
                horizon. Beni does likewise. The Americans look puzzled.</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> Well, what the hell we doin'?</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Patience, my good sahib, patience.</p>
              <p>Henderson looks over at O'Connell.</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> First one to the city, O'Connell!<br>
                Five hundred! Cash bucks!</p>
              <p>O'Connell and Beni just stare out at the flat nothingness.<br>
                Evelyn and Jonathan share a look. And then, the SUN starts to<br>
                rise in the distance, breaking the flat horizon.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Get ready.</p>
              <p>Evelyn can feel the suspense and the majesty of the moment.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> For what?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> we're about to be shown the way.</p>
              <p>Far off to the right, a HUGE SHAPE begins to rise with the<br>
                sun. A VOLCANO. O'Connell and Beni watch it, expressionless.<br>
                Daniels, Henderson and Burns share a look, and then--</p>
              <p> DANIELS/HENDERSON/BURNS</p>
              <p> HEYA!</p>
              <p>The Americans take off. Racing towards the rising volcano.</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> SEE YA THERE, O'CONNELL!</p>
              <p>Evelyn and Jonathan give O'Connell anxious, sarcastic looks.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Ah, begging your pardon, but<br>
                shouldn't we be going?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> After all, you rode us night<br>
                and day to win that bet.</p>
              <p>O'Connell doesn't say a word, staring hard.<br>
                Beni watches the Americans and spits into the sand.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Fools</p>
              <p><br>
                And then suddenly, the volcano SHIFTS ACROSS THE HORIZON.<br>
                Passing across the sun as it goes. --It's a MIRAGE.<br>
                The Americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other<br>
                way, after the volcano. Evelyn and Jonathan smile, amazed.<br>
                The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN, floating across the watery horizon.<br>
                The Americans crash to a stop again and chase after the<br>
                volcano. All three of them confused and CURSING. O'Connell<br>
                and Beni just stare, waiting. The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN. And<br>
                the Americans crash to a stop again. Burns is THROWN from his<br>
                horse. Henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it to<br>
                the ground. Daniels just curses as they give up the chase.</p>
              <p>The volcano comes to a stop on the far left of the horizon.<br>
                The Americans are on the far right. Nothing moves. A BEAT.<br>
                And then O'Connell grins. So does Beni. They share a look.<br>
                And then SWAT their camels and RACE AWAY. Everybody else<br>
                hauls-ass after them. O'Connell and Beni are neck-and-neck.<br>
                And then Evelyn comes galloping up, hair flying in the wind.<br>
                Beni takes out his camel whip and starts WHIPPING O'Connell.<br>
                Trying to knock him off his camel. once. CRACK! Twice. CRACK!<br>
                But on the third try O'Connell grabs the whip and JERKS Beni<br>
                off his camel. Beni SLAMS to the ground and TUMBLES.<br>
                Evelyn and O'Connell race across the desert. Evelyn has never<br>
                felt so alive. She LAUGHS. O'Connell grins; he likes this<br>
                girl. Beni stumbles to his feet, then quickly dances out of<br>
                the way as Jonathan and all the other riders stampede past<br>
                him. Evelyn beats O'Connell to the stone ramp, racing hard.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Evelyn! Slow down!</p>
              <p>Evelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> SLOW DOWN, EVELYN! SLOW DOWN!<br>
                THERE'S A REALLY BIG--</p>
              <p>INT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY</p>
              <p>--Evelyn goes ass-over-teacups through the air and crash lands<br>
                in a sand dune. She sits up, stunned, sandy hair in her eyes.<br>
                O'Connell stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Never mind.</p>
              <p>The Americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside<br>
                the volcano. O'Connell gives them a big, shit-eating grin.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> You boys owe me five hundred dollars.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>ext. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY</p>
              <p>Under the guidance of the Egyptologist, the Diggers are busy<br>
                hauling rock and dirt out of the Temple doorway. The three<br>
                Americans are playing poker. Beni smokes a hookah and swats<br>
                flies. Dozens of stray CAMELS roam the decrepit city; dusty<br>
                backpacks and old saddlebags still slung over their humps.</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> Where'd all these camels come from?</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> They belong to the dead. They<br>
                will wait years for their<br>
                masters to return before leaving.</p>
              <p>EXT. OUR HEROES DIG - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden are working next<br>
                to a narrow CREVICE, which weaves it's way through the ruins.<br>
                O'Connell ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of<br>
                the coils into the crevice, about to rappel down. Jonathan<br>
                bends over to have a look, his ass hits something, he YELPS<br>
                and backs away. It's the decrepit FACE OF ANUBIS.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> That thing gives me the creeps.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Be nice. That thing saved my life.</p>
              <p>Evelyn is positioning ancient MIRRORS along the crevice.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> That &quot;thing&quot; gets me excited</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> (sarcastic)<br>
                The things that get you excited.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> According to Bembridge Scholars,<br>
                inside the statue of Anubis was<br>
                a secret compartment, perhaps<br>
                containing The Book Of The Living.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> What are those mirrors for?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.</p>
              <p>O'Connell shrugs, then rappels down into the crevice</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>INT. EMBALMER'S CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell- waves a TORCH as Jonathan, Evelyn and the warden<br>
                drop down next to him. Evelyn peers into the spooky darkness.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Do you realize, we are standing<br>
                inside a room that no one has<br>
                entered in over four thousand years. </p>
              <p> WARDEN</p>
              <p> Who cares? I don't see no treasure.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> You're welcome to my share of<br>
                the spider webs.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> And it stinks to high heaven in here.</p>
              <p>Evelyn just rolls her eyes.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Cretins.</p>
              <p>Jonathan sniffs the foul air, then he looks at the warden and<br>
                realizes where the smell is coming from. He stops sniffing.</p>
              <p>Evelyn brushes COBWEBS away from a METAL DISK on the wall,<br>
                then repositions it on it's pedestal, aiming it at a RAY OF</p>
              <p>LIGHT shining in from the outer mirrors. --THE RAY OF LIGHT<br>
                HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY SHOOTS AROUND THE ROOM FROM ONE<br>
                DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP. LIGHT RAYS<br>
                SHOOT OFF DOWN THE PASSAGEWAYS. It's the embalmer's chamber.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> That is a neat trick.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Oh my god, It's a preparation room.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Preparation for what?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> For entering the afterlife</p>
              <p>O'Connell quickly draws his gun. Jonathan gently nudges him,</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Mummies, my good son, this is<br>
                where they made the mummies.</p>
              <p>Evelyn heads down a narrow passageway. The others follow.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>INT. LABYRINTH - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch as they make their way<br>
                through a narrow, COBWEB INFESTED LABYRINTH. The short, squat<br>
                warden can stand straight up. Then they hear something and<br>
                freeze. It sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls.<br>
                They share looks. Then slowly move forward. Getting darker<br>
                and darker as they go. The strange sound getting louder and<br>
                louder. And then it stops. Evelyn holds her breath. Jonathan<br>
                licks his lips. O'Connell cocks his pistol. The warden FARTS.<br>
                O'Connell, Jonathan and Evelyn glare at him.</p>
              <p>ANUBIS CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>They slowly creep -out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of<br>
                an enormous half-buried statue. The lower half of Anubis.<br>
                Then they hear the sound again, coming closer now, from the<br>
                other side of the statue. And closer. O'Connell pulls Evelyn<br>
                behind him. And closer. O'Connell raises his gun. And CLOSER!</p>
              <p>O'Connell LEAPS OUT. --THREE HORRIBLE SWEATY FACES LUNGE AT<br>
                HIM. O'Connell REACTS. But doesn't pull the trigger because<br>
                it's just the Americans, their guns are up, cocked and aimed.</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> Ya scared the bejeezus out of<br>
                us, O'Connell.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Likewise.</p>
              <p>But nobody lowers their guns. Daniels grins, the tough one.</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> This here is our statue,...friend.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Don't see your name on it,...pal</p>
              <p>And that's when Beni, five Diggers and the Egyptologist step<br>
                out of the shadows, --all holding guns aimed at O'Connell.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Ten to one, O'Connell, your<br>
                odds are no-so-good.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I've had worse</p>
              <p>Jonathan clenches a tiny derringer.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Yes, me too,</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>O'Connell gives him a sideways glance. Beni cocks his gun,<br>
                grinning, he wants it to happen. The tension thickens. Then<br>
                Evelyn gently takes O'Connell's gun hand and pulls it down.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Let's be nice, children, if<br>
                we're going to play together,<br>
                we must learn to share.</p>
              <p>Evelyn pulls O'Connell away. Jonathan and the Warden follow.<br>
                Beni and the Americans slowly lower their guns, laughing. The<br>
                Egyptologist excitedly begins translating the hieroglyphs.</p>
              <p>INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell and Jonathan are using sledge-hammers against the<br>
                ceiling. Evelyn is gently chipping away with a tiny chisel.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> According to my calculations,<br>
                we should be right under the<br>
                statue. We'll come up right<br>
                between his legs.</p>
              <p>(she blushes and laughs)<br>
                Oh my.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> And when those dirty Yanks go<br>
                to sleep--</p>
              <p>(looks at O'Connell)</p>
              <p> No offense.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> None taken</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> --We'll sneak up and steal that<br>
                book right out from under them.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> And you're sure you can find the<br>
                secret compartment?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Yes, if their Egyptologist hasn't<br>
                already found it.</p>
              <p>Jonathan looks around.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> I say, what's our smelly little<br>
                friend got himself up to?</p>

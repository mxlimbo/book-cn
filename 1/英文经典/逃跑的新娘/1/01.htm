              FADE IN</p>
            <p> EXT. AN IMPOSSIBLE EXPANSE OF MARYLAND FARMLAND - DAY</p>
            <p> The wind rustles the endless field of corn, blows over the <br>
              freshly mown meadow of soybeans, and magically sways a copse of 
              <br>
              trees. <br>
              <br>
              It's a Fall after-noon. A SUDDEN POUNDING OF GALLOPING HOOVES <br>
              breaks the peace and... A HORSE and RIDER burst between the rows 
              <br>
              of corn into the meadow. They are running for their lives.</p>
            <p> CLOSE ON:</p>
            <p> The rider is a bride -- a beautiful woman dressed in a <br>
              disheveled wedding gown, it's train tattered and flying like a <br>
              knight's banner out behind her. This is MAGGIE CARPENTER.</p>
            <p> The horse is frothing and wild-eyed, like the bride, who turns 
              <br>
              to look behind her in terror. The horse's labored breathing <br>
              mingles with Maggie's panicked gasps.</p>
            <p> We see a WEDDING BOUQUET fly into a ditch as the horse thunders 
              <br>
              on. Maggie clings to the reins. She looks as though she is <br>
              running from the devil himself.</p>

            <p> IKE (V.O.)<br>
              Hey, Fisher, pick up. I have some <br>
              column ideas I want to bounce off you. <br>
              Not there? Okay. Listen I'm thinking <br>
              of writing about those mind-numbing <br>
              informercials that are always on.</p>
            <p> Ike walks out of his apartment building talking on cell phone.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              What do you think? Good idea, right? <br>
              Boring, down to death, pointless -- It <br>
              sucks.</p>
            <p> Ike yells at a CONSTRUCTION WORKER.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              If you guys are here any longer, <br>
              they're gonna make you sign a lease.</p>
            <p> CONSTRUCTION WORKER<br>
              Your column should be so funny.</p>
            <p> Ike turns and walks down the street, talking into cell phone.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Okay, I was also thinking I might write <br>
              about...</p>
            <p> He spots a RICH LADY with tons of diamonds getting out of a <br>
              Limousine, talking to a CHAUFFEUR. He goes up to her.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              Excuse me. I was thinking of doing an <br>
              article on limousines. What would you <br>
              say to people who never had a chance to <br>
              drive in a limo?</p>
            <p> They walk up to her DOORMAN.</p>
            <p> LADY<br>
              I'm sorry, I don't know any people like <br>
              that.</p>
            <p> Ike walks off. They stare at him as he goes.</p>
            <p> EXT. ANOTHER NEW YORK STREET - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike's talking on the phone to his friend's machine again.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Fisher? Come on -- I know you're <br>
              sitting there laughing at me. Pick up. <br>
              I want to run an idea past you.</p>
            <p> Ike continues walking now in the full panic of writer's block. 
              <br>
              He pleads into his friend's answering machine as he walks.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              I just could use someone to toss it <br>
              back and forth with for a few minutes, <br>
              get the juice flowing, help me. I have <br>
              an hour and twenty-seven minutes and <br>
              fifty-two seconds. Hello?</p>
            <p> He walks away from the t-shirt table towards the bar. The <br>
              Vendor calls out to him.</p>
            <p> T-SHIRT VENDOR<br>
              Hey, Ike, when are you going to put me <br>
              in an article?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              When your t-shirts stop shrinking.</p>
            <p> Ike enters the bar. The Woman drops the shirt she was holding 
              <br>
              and walks off with her children. The T-shirt Vendor goes back <br>
              to selling his shirts.</p>
            <p> INT. NEW YORK BAR - LATE DAY</p>
            <p> Ike sits at the bar speaking to an attractive Woman nearby, a 
              <br>
              MAN puts is USA Today on the bar and addresses the BARTENDER.</p>
            <p> MAN<br>
              I see photos of a lot of dead writers <br>
              on these walls. Got any living ones? <br>
              I have a story to tell that could win <br>
              one of them a Pulitzer.<br>
              (then, with enthusiasm)<br>
              Picture this, if you will. A small <br>
              town in Maryland, a sleepy little <br>
              village, within that a hardware store...</p>
            <p> The Man continues speaking as Ike and the woman continue their 
              <br>
              conversation.</p>
            <p> WOMAN<br>
              So what's in store for us in tomorrow's <br>
              column?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I don't know yet. I'm kind of a last-<br>
              minute man. Ideas don't flow until an <br>
              hour or two before deadline.</p>
            <p> The Woman gets up and begins throwing darts.</p>
            <p> WOMAN<br>
              (interrupting)<br>
              This is very interesting. You get your <br>
              ideas for your column from life. You <br>
              start up a conversation with a woman in <br>
              a bar, attack her choice of reading <br>
              material, try and get a rise out of her <br>
              while you contemplate whether or not <br>
              she's worth hitting on.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No, I can't hit on you until I get an <br>
              idea.</p>
            <p> She starts throwing darts.</p>
            <p> WOMAN<br>
              That's flattering.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No, you don't understand.</p>
            <p> The Woman goes to her bar stool, gathering her bag and leaves 
              a <br>
              tip for the Bartender.</p>
            <p> WOMAN<br>
              I think I do understand. So my not <br>
              responding to your baiting me will <br>
              inspire one of those potential bitter <br>
              diatribes you love to write about women <br>
              and all the things we do to drive men <br>
              crazy?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (taken aback)<br>
              I don't write bitter diatribes about <br>
              women... very often.</p>
            <p> She whacks him with a newspaper, then shakes his hand.</p>
            <p> WOMAN<br>
              Only when the ideas aren't flowing, <br>
              huh? Well, it was very nice to meet <br>
              you, one-minute man.</p>
            <p> The Woman leaves the bar.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (as she exits)<br>
              That's last minute man.<br>
              (then, louder)<br>
              And it's the quality that counts.</p>
            <p> BARTENDER<br>
              You know, for a good looking man, you <br>
              strike out a lot.</p>
            <p> MAN<br>
              I've seen much worse.</p>
            <p> The phone rings. Te Bartender answers it as Ike sits back on <br>
              his bar stool. Ike grabs the woman's magazine that she left on <br>
              the bar and starts glancing at it. The Man at the bar has heard 
              <br>
              the whole thing.</p>
            <p> MAN (cont'd)<br>
              I said, I've seen much worse.</p>
            <p> Ike looks at the Man with reservation. The Man is George <br>
              Swilling.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Excuse me?</p>
            <p> MAN<br>
              The brush-off.</p>
            <p> Ike gets up and moves to the dart board. He removes the darts.</p>
            <p> MAN (cont'd)<br>
              I've witnessed far more treacherous and <br>
              nefarious exits than that. At least <br>
              she castigated you in private.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Not as private as I thought.</p>
            <p> Ike turns slightly, giving the man his back.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              Kevin, you've got some napkins?</p>
            <p> BARTENDER<br>
              Writing or wiping?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Give me a pen.</p>
            <p> The Bartender gives him cocktail napkins and a pen. Ike starts 
              <br>
              making notes. Ike looks up from his writing. The Man gets up <br>
              and starts throwing darts.</p>
            <p> MAN<br>
              (throwing darts hard)<br>
              Ah, come on. They deserve it. They <br>
              love you, they hate you, they're hot, <br>
              they're cold, they're high, they're <br>
              low...</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              ... They're up, they're down. It's <br>
              really fun making this list with you, <br>
              but I've got a column to go write.</p>

              Well, there's a girl from my hometown <br>
              you could write about.</p>
            <p> Ike moves to the Bartender and pays him.</p>
            <p> BARTENDER<br>
              (to Man)<br>
              Excuse me, we don't need any new ideas.</p>
            <p> MAN<br>
              She likes to dump grooms right at the <br>
              altar. They call her &quot;The Runaway <br>
              Bride&quot;.</p>
            <p> Both Ike and Bartender turn and stare.</p>
            <p> MAN<br>
              She performed the travesty seven or <br>
              eight times. Right at the altar she <br>
              turns around and runs like hell. <br>
              Bolts.</p>
            <p> Ike turns and heads for the door. The Man calls after him, <br>
              getting up from his stool without stopping his enthusiastic <br>
              story.</p>

              She's twirling another body on the <br>

              (to the Women)<br>
              We have to go to Maggie. Cindy, mind <br>

            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              Holy moly.</p>
            <p> The older one, Mrs. Pressman, listens with a pained expression 
              <br>
              as the younger one, Peggy, continues to read the column aloud. <br>
              Neither one can believe what they're reading.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (reads)<br>
              &quot;What is unusual about Miss Carpenter <br>
              is that she likes to dress her men up <br>
              as grooms before she devours them. She <br>
              has already disemboweled six in a row <br>
              by leaving them at the altar.&quot;... I <br>
              can't ready anymore.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              (takes paper from <br>
              her, reads)<br>
              &quot;And her ritual feast continues as she <br>
              prepares to make a sacrifice out of the <br>
              seventh fiance. So all bets are on and <br>
              we hope that this boomerang bride isn't <br>
              honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers <br>
              because many predict that this girl is <br>

            <p> INT. HARDWARE STORE - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> Peggy and Mrs. Pressman enter, worried.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              You tell Maggie.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              No, you tell her.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              No, no. You're her best friend.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              No.</p>

              You know, it's just possible that she <br>
              hasn't read this yet.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Yeah.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              Maybe she hasn't read the paper...</p>
            <p> On the counter, they see a copy of USA Today opened to the <br>
              article about Maggie.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN (cont'd)<br>
              ... Or not!</p>
            <p> We follow MAGGIE down the back stairs inside The Hale Hardware 
              <br>
              Store, the prettiest, most welcoming shop of its kind anywhere <br>
              in small town USA. Somehow the place ha taken on the spirit of <br>
              the owner's daughter; both stop and shop-girl radiate brightness, 
              <br>
              charm, and possibility. Maggie comes down steps with a faucet <br>
              handle and goes to an elderly customer, MR. PAXTON.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (bright)<br>
              Here we go! One antique hot water <br>
              handle with the &quot;HOT&quot; still on it, <br>
              guaranteed to fit any American Standard <br>
              cast iron tub with a four-inch center <br>
              made between 1924 and 1938. In other <br>
              words, I think you're out of the <br>
              doghouse with Mrs. Paxton.</p>
            <p> MR. PAXTON<br>
              (amazed)<br>
              Hallelujah.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Alright, Mr. Paxton, I'll put it on <br>
              your account.</p>
            <p> Maggie rounds the bend, another customer, EARL, stands by the 
              <br>
              paint machine.</p>
            <p> EARL<br>
              Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (walking past customer)<br>
              You don't need an air conditioner, Earl, <br>
              you just need an attic fan -- There's <br>
              more in the back.</p>
            <p> Maggie steps behind the front counter of the store and takes the 
              <br>
              account book out. Her voice trails off as she sees the dour <br>
              expression on the faces of her friends.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> Peggy nervously mentions the newspaper.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (delicate)<br>
              So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (serious)<br>
              Yes, I've seen it. And I have to say <br>
              it's the rudest and most offensive... <br>
              joke anybody's ever played on me!</p>
            <p> To their amazement, Maggie starts smiling.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              You guys! How long did this take you?</p>
            <p> Maggie stays amused.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Where'd you get this done?<br>
              (laughing)<br>
              You creeps! I should disinvite you! <br>
              And why did you say seven times? This <br>
              is four.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Uh, Maggie, you told us to bachelorette <br>
              jokes, so we didn't...</p>
            <p> Maggie looks at the stricken face of her friends.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              Holy moly.</p>
            <p> Peggy looks like she is going to cry with sympathy for Maggie. 
              <br>
              Maggie is starting to feel uncomfortable. She looks down, <br>
              dubiously, at the paper.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Um, you know, now would be a good <br>
              moment to tell me this is fake.<br>
              (no response)<br>
              It won't be funny if you drag it out. <br>
              Okay?<br>
              (no response)<br>
              Okay, well... I mean, I can find out... <br>
              Real newspapers smear. Phoney papers <br>
              don't.</p>
            <p> She picks up the paper and brushes it against her apron, leaving 
              <br>
              an INK SMEAR!!</p>
            <p> She nearly kneels over.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              (sitting)<br>
              Bag.</p>
            <p> Peggy and Mrs. Pressman immediately spring to her side. They <br>
              give her a bag to breathe in.</p>

            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S WORKOUT ROOM/GYM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> We see Maggie kickboxing in anger. The radio is on. She <br>
              suddenly stops, yanks Ike's article off the wall, leaves her <br>
              workout area and goes to her desk.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON DESK AREA:</p>
            <p> She turns off the radio and begins to type her letter.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (V.O.)<br>
              &quot;Dear Editor...&quot;</p>
            <p> EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT</p>
            <p> As Maggie's VOICE-OVER continues to read her letter, we take in 
              <br>
              a Manhattan busy day. It is big, loud, and anonymous.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)<br>
              &quot;Greeting from the sticks! Perhaps you <br>
              believe that a rural education is <br>
              focused mainly on hog calling and <br>
              tractor maintenance rather than reading. <br>
              Why else would you print a piece of <br>
              fiction about me and call it fact?&quot;</p>
            <p> Te CAMERA FINDS Ike, striding across a busy street, dodging <br>
              taxies. A WOMAN smacks him with a newspaper. He passes a WOMAN <br>
              TRAFFIC OFFICER, then a hot dog stand. He greets and passes a <br>
              FALAFEL VENDOR. THE CAMERA PANS to a USA Today Truck.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)<br>
              &quot;I suppose Mr. Graham was too busy <br>
              thinking us slanderous statements about <br>
              how I dump men for kicks to bother with <br>
              something silly like accuracy in <br>
              reporting. Which is understandable, <br>
              because with a &quot;man-eater&quot; like me on <br>
              the loose, who has time to check facts?&quot;</p>
            <p> EXT. USA TODAY LOADING DOCKS - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> He passes regular GUYS who cheer him.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)<br>
              &quot;Still, we cannibalistic queens can get <br>
              pretty cranky when we see things in <br>
              print that hurt our feelings, like that <br>
              we deliberately abandon fiances with <br>
              malice aforethought.&quot;</p>
            <p> INT. USA TODAY LOADING DOCKS - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> He enters the newspaper building, going to Ellie's office.</p>
            <p> INT. USA TODAY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> He walks through the crowded city room. His arrival attracts a 
              <br>
              lot of attention from his CO-WORKERS. Ike seems a little <br>
              surprised, but he's pleased.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)<br>
              &quot;That's why I was surprised to find Mr. <br>
              Graham's editor was a woman. Call me a <br>
              sentimental fool, but I sort of hoped <br>
              we man-eater could stick together.&quot;</p>
            <p> Ike works his way down the hall to the editor's office. CHUFFA 
              <br>
              Ike greets various workers. He steps up to the editor's <br>
              secretary, ELAINE. She doesn't smile.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (to Elaine)<br>
              I'll put in a good word for you.</p>
            <p> ELAINE<br>
              No, no, don't mention my name in there.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Why?</p>
            <p> A buzz.</p>
            <p> ELAINE<br>
              You can go in now.</p>
            <p> Ike goes into Ellie's office. Elaine picks up her phone.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. ELLIE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> ELLIE is that editor. Stylish and successful looking, she's <br>
              about Ike's age. Ellie sits behind a big desk with a scowl on <br>
              her pretty face. Her casual-looking husband, Fisher, sits <br>
              nonchalantly on the arm of the couch. Ike enters as Ellie reads 
              <br>
              Maggie's letter.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              (reading letter)<br>
              &quot;Anyway, I'm just dropping you big city <br>
              folk this little note to say that I have <br>
              thought of a ritual sacrifice that would <br>
              satisfy my current appetite: Ike <br>
              Graham's column on a platter. Yours <br>
              truly, Maggie Carpenter. P.S. -- I <br>
              have inclosed a list of the gross <br>
              factual misrepresentations in your <br>
              article. There are fifteen.&quot;</p>
            <p> Ike sits as Ellie puts the letter down and takes off her glasses.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (chuckles as he sits)<br>
              Fully. I like her. She has wit.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              I left four messages. You don't return <br>
              my calls.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              So? I never returned your calls, even <br>
              when we were married. And what's <br>
              Fisher doing here anyway?</p>
            <p> Fisher gets and places a photo of the cat on a bookshelf on his 
              <br>
              way to the other side of the room.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Ellie asked me to come down to offer <br>
              moral support.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Since when does Ellie need moral supp--</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              -- It's for you, Ike.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Journalism lesson number one. If you <br>
              fabricate your facts, you get fired.</p>
            <p> Ellie pushes USA Today lawyer's letter across the desk for him 
              <br>
              to read. Ike picks it up and skims the letter. His face is as <br>
              impassive as stone.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Lesson number two. Never work for your <br>
              former spouse.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              That's not nothing to do with it. You <br>
              cooked this story up and you know it.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I didn't cook up a story. I had a <br>
              source.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Someone reliable, I'm sure. A booze-<br>
              hound in a bar?</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              In vino veritas.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Don't knock drunk guys in bars. Drunk <br>
              guys in bars are good. It means <br>
              they're not driving.</p>
            <p> Ike gets up and stands near Ellie, making his point.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              Besides, I'm a columnist. This is what <br>
              columnists are supposed to do. This is <br>
              what you like. We push, we stretch, we <br>
              go out on a limo. That's what makes me <br>
              good!</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              No, that's what makes you unemployed.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I merely write the stuff. You're the <br>
              one that serves it up.</p>
            <p> Ike puts down the letter and puts his glasses back into his <br>
              pocket.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Not anymore. I have to draw the line.<br>
              (pushing a piece <br>
              of paper)<br>
              She sent us this list. Our lawyers say <br>
              it's actionable.</p>
            <p> Ellie hands Ike Maggie's list.</p>

              Lawyers.<br>
              (glances at list)<br>
              I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is <br>
              going to be very tough on you. It's <br>
              going to be hard to get over. There <br>
              will be therapy bills for you.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              (shrugs)<br>
              I already made an appointment for later <br>
              today.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (putting the list <br>
              down, standing)<br>
              See? You want custody of my job? ... <br>
              Why not just consider my wrist slapped <br>
              and call me when you feel I've served <br>
              my time?</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              I'm sorry, Ike. This is permanent.</p>
            <p> Fisher winces and looks away. Ike and Ellie look at each other 
              <br>
              for a sober moment.</p>
            <p> ELLIE (V.O.; cont'd)<br>
              If you go quietly, I'll get you <br>
              severance pay.</p>
            <p> Ellie fidgets with her toy rake, then Ike heads for the door. 
              <br>
              He laughs a little at the painful truth of her words and walks <br>
              out. Ellie collapses back in her chair. Fisher goes to her and <br>
              rubs her shoulders.</p>
            <p> EXT. USA TODAY LOADING DOCK - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike rides sadly on the back of a forklift, gets off and walks 
              <br>
              out.</p>
            <p> EXT. HALE RESIDENTIAL STREET - ANOTHER MORNING</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON MAGGIE'S HOUSE:</p>
            <p> A train goes by. A modest clapboard house with a porch. Two <br>
              entrances. A PAPERBOY tosses a paper onto the lawn in front of <br>
              the house. The front door opens and Maggie appears fresh out of 
              <br>
              bed, wearing only a jacket and panties. Heedless of being seen <br>
              this way, she scampers out to the sidewalk to pick up her <br>
              delivered paper: USA Today. She tears off the plastic bag and <br>
              rips into it, looking for her letter. She finds it. A smile on <br>
              her face, then she scampers back into the house.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - THAT MOMENT</p>
            <p> Maggie skips back into her house which she shares with Father 
              <br>
              and Grandma. A cozy and eclectic place creatively furnished on <br>
              a shoe-string. She rushes into: KITCHEN WHERE BOB KELLY, <br>
              fiance #4, is packing cans into a backpack. Bob, 38, has a <br>
              pleasant face and a body that is almost shockingly buff. He's <br>
              wearing a T-shirt that reads: &quot;Mountaineers Do It Against the 
              <br>
              Wall.&quot;, Maggie dances over, waving the paper and singing.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              She canned him, she canned him...</p>
            <p> Bob test the weight of the backpack adding dehydrate food.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Come here, Mag, and try this on.</p>
            <p> Maggie puts the paper on the kitchen counter and starts to read 
              <br>
              aloud, paying no mind to Bob, who is sticking her arms through <br>
              the straps of the backpack.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Listen: &quot;Dear Ms. Carpenter, I <br>
              apologize to you for this unfortunate <br>
              matter. Ike Graham's column will no <br>
              longer be appearing in this paper. <br>
              Best of luck in you upcoming marriage!&quot;</p>
            <p> Bob continues to hold up the weight of the backpack as he straps 
              <br>
              it onto Maggie's shoulders.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              That-a-girl! You sacked him.<br>
              (checking pack)<br>
              This is the weight of the pack you're <br>
              going to have to carry in the Himalayas. <br>
              Tell me if it's too heavy.</p>
            <p> Bob lets go and Maggie FALLS BACKWARD, disappearing behind the 
              <br>
              counter, and hitting the floor, with a THUD. Bob looks down at <br>
              her. Maggie's voice rises from the floor behind the counter.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (o.s.)<br>
              It's a little... It's a little heavy... <br>
              Help me, baby.</p>
            <p> Bob has no answer. He reaches a hand down. He yelps as Maggie 
              <br>
              pulls him down on top of her, out of frame. We HEAR them giggle 
              <br>
              and kiss.</p>
            <p> INT. USA TODAY LOADING DOCK - ANOTHER DAY</p>
            <p> Fisher uses the dock for a photo shoot featuring men and women 
              <br>
              in evening and formal wear from Escada for G.Q. Fisher is not <br>
              actually shooting the camera, but rather supervising it. <br>
              Fisher claps his hands and calls the models to attention. Then <br>
              he goes onto the stage and sets the models in their positions.</p>
            <p> FISHER (cont'd)<br>
              Remember, we are putting the &quot;fun&quot; back <br>
              into formal.<br>
              (to Ike)<br>
              I just say that for the agency guys. I <br>
              don't even know what that means. Now <br>
              follow me.</p>
            <p> INT. USA TODAY OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Elevator doors open. Ike and Fisher exit and walk towards the 
              <br>
              coffee table.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride <br>
              piece, and since I do freelance stuff <br>
              for G.Q., I'm in a different position <br>
              now...</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              What are you trying to say to me, Fish?</p>
            <p> They stop walking.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Vindication. How would you like to get <br>
              some? A chance to prove that, though <br>
              your facts weren't entirely straight, <br>
              your theory was correct.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (hiding his hope)<br>
              The real story on Miss Carpenter.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              All the gory details.</p>
            <p> They start walking again.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (excited)<br>
              The anatomy of the black widow spider <br>
              of Maryland.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              It wouldn't be a bad way to get you <br>
              back into writing feature pieces <br>
              again.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (enthusiastically)<br>
              This is good. It is a good story, <br>
              Fish.</p>
            <p> They stop at the coffee table and grab something to eat.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              (nods)<br>
              If she runs, then it's a cover story. <br>
              All true. All accurate.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (confesses)<br>
              Okay, you were right. I hated my <br>
              column, but I can do this assignment.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Then you've got it. If you leave <br>
              tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll <br>
              have plenty of time before her next <br>
              wedding trot.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              &quot;Paid vindication&quot; That's what I call <br>
              justice.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Justice, yes. Paid, I don't know. <br>
              They like the idea, but my hands are <br>
              tied with budget restraints.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              But I'll get my normal fee, right?</p>
            <p> He walks away.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You want me to do it on spec?!</p>
            <p> He follows him.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. MARYLAND HIGHWAY - DAY</p>
            <p> We see Ike driving down the highway. The car sputters a little 
              <br>
              as he and Fisher continue their conversation in voice-over. (If 
              <br>
              needed by the editor.)</p>
            <p> FISHER (V.O.)<br>
              Don't say &quot;spec&quot; like it's a dirty word. <br>
              Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a <br>
              play! Plato never got a book advance...</p>
            <p> IKE (V.O.)<br>
              Oh yeah! I happen to know from <br>
              reliable sources that Nietzche got <br>
              expenses and a rental car.</p>
            <p> We hear Fisher laugh.</p>
            <p> IKE (V.O.; cont'd)<br>
              I'm going to make this work, Fish. I'm <br>
              going to do it!</p>
            <p> Ike's car drives into Hale, passing a billboard reading, <br>
              &quot;Welcome to Hale.&quot;</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. HALE STREET - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike drives down picturesque Main Street. He passes Hale <br>
              Hardware. Sign says: &quot;At Curl. Be back soon.&quot;</p>
            <p> EXT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - DAY</p>
            <p> A BARBERSHOP QUARTET is singing in front of the only hotel in 
              <br>
              town. Ike pulls up and goes inside.</p>
            <p> INT. LOBBY/ATLANTIC HOTEL - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike has checked into the Atlantic Hotel. The clerk, LEE, hands 
              <br>
              him his key. Ike asks about room service and the restaurant. <br>
              An OLDER WOMAN asks him if he plays bridge as he goes up the <br>
              stairs to his room.</p>
            <p> EXT. HALE MAIN STREET - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike exits his hotel as the Barber Shop Quartet finishes singing 
              <br>
              &quot;Camptown Races.&quot;</p>
            <p> He now walks down the charming main artery of the town, looking 
              <br>
              exactly like what he is: a cynical New York out of his element <br>
              on sunny Main Street, USA. KIDS ride by on bikes, streaming <br>
              balloons behind them. A balloon hits Ike on the face. As he <br>
              crosses the street, he mutters into his tape recorder:</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I think I'm in Maryberry.</p>
            <p> Flags hang on all the storefronts and the place sparkles with 
              <br>
              wholesome attitudes as PEOPLE greet each other familiarly. Ike <br>
              comes to beauty parlor called &quot;Curl Up and Dye&quot;. The place 
              is <br>
              doing business and crowded with WOMEN.</p>
            <p> INT. BEAUTY PARLOR - DAY</p>
            <p> Cindy, the manicurist, does Mrs. Pressman's nails. Maggie sits 
              <br>
              on the floor next to Peggy's salon chair, fixing the base of a <br>
              barber chair. She tightens a screw and looks up, satisfied. <br>
              Cindy's dog is on the floor near Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Cindy, you better 86 Sprout. He seems <br>
              to be enjoying the petroleum <br>
              distillates.</p>
            <p> Cindy rolls over in her chair, picks up her dog and rolls back 
              <br>
              to her station.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              That's it. Back to obedience school.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (to Peggy)<br>
              Okay -- have a seat... gently, <br>
              carefully.</p>
            <p> Peggy sits in the chair. Maggie spins her around and around.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (delighted as <br>
              she spins)<br>
              You're a goddess!</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I didn't even need to change this <br>
              gasket, just put in a little hydraulic <br>
              fluid.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Stop it. When you talk like that, I <br>
              get turned on and it frightens me.</p>
            <p> JUST THEN. Ike enters the salon, taking off his sunglasses. <br>
              Peggy hops off the chair.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Hello. I'm looking for Maggie <br>
              Carpenter. There was a sign at the <br>
              hardware store across the street...</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Are you a reporter?</p>
            <p> It's a little early in the game for Ike to be thrown off guard.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (shocked)<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (eyeing his loafers)<br>
              It's been our experience that anyone <br>
              with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers <br>
              ends up being another big city reporter <br>
              wanting to interview Maggie.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              About her upcoming wedding and all.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              No, about her getting that asshole from <br>
              New York fired.</p>
            <p> Ike smiles down at his loafers and shrugs.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I am just such a reporter. And you are?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Peggy Phleming. Not the ice skater.</p>
            <p> Peggy steps aside. Ike moves toward Cindy and Mrs. Pressman.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              And who are these lovely ladies?</p>
            <p> Te ladies shake his hand and introduce themselves.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              Cindy. Maggie's unmarried cousin.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              Mrs. Pressman. No relation.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              And you are?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (turning toward her)<br>
              Looking for Maggie.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Yep. Maggie -- Someone to see you.</p>
            <p> Maggie looks over from her sitting position on the floor. She 
              <br>
              gives Ike the once-over, focusing on the shoes.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (yelling to Peggy)<br>
              Reporter?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Yup!</p>
            <p> Ike crouches to see Maggie on the floor just as she rises to her 
              <br>
              feet. Ike straightens up. For a moment, he is thrown by her <br>
              beauty and intelligent eyes.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I hope you have a different angle. <br>
              It's pretty much all been covered.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Originality is my speciality.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Excellent.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in <br>
              here unless they're getting haircut.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              She's the boss.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Sorry, no. I just got one.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              (to Ike)<br>
              Excuse me, sir. I have an actual fact <br>
              for you.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (steps to Mrs. Pressman)<br>
              Yes, Mrs. Pressman.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              It's her fourth time to the altar, you <br>
              know. Not seven like they said.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I know. Tell me something. Do you <br>
              think she's going to make it all the <br>
              way this time?</p>
            <p> During the Ike/Mrs. Pressman exchange, Maggie looks at Ike. <br>
              There's something familiar about him. She looks over at Peggy <br>
              and beckons her to a copy of Ike's column affixed to a mirror. <br>
              A goatee and horns, have been scrawled on Ike's byline picture. 
              <br>
              He's been &quot;devilized&quot;. Peggy coughs as she recognizes 
              Ike in <br>
              the newspaper clipping.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              She swallowed her gun.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Pressman continues her story to Ike.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              I'm not sure. Mr. Schullian runs the <br>
              newsstand, he's our local bookie, you <br>
              know, he's giving eight to one odds she <br>
              won't. He says she's so famous now, <br>
              maybe Vegas will give odds on her. I'm <br>
              going to wait to hear what the pros say.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Good fact. Well, you let me know.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              Oh, I will.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Maggie indicates column to Peggy. She looks over at the part of 
              <br>
              the shop used to wash and dye hair. There's a sink, stool and a 
              <br>
              cabinet affixed to the wall above sink, which holds various <br>
              shampoos and hair dyes. Maggie gets an idea. Maggie and Peggy <br>
              step forward toward Ike.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Well, instead of a haircut, how about <br>
              a wash? You know, get all that city <br>
              grit out of it.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You'll answer my questions?</p>
            <p> Maggie nods affirmatively.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              (removing his jacket)<br>
              Fine. You wash, I'll ask the <br>
              questions.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Great.</p>
            <p> Ike hands Peggy his jacket. A mystified Peggy leads Ike to the 
              <br>
              sink. While she does this...</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Have a seat. Peggy, why don't you give <br>
              him the special treatment that <br>
              strengthens the follicles.</p>
            <p> Ike sits in the chair near the sink. Maggie shakes out a smock 
              <br>
              and puts it around Ike.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              So, what do you want to know?</p>
            <p> Ike leans and rests his head on the sink. Peggy bends over him 
              <br>
              and wets his hair. She grabs various hair coloring products.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Getting nervous?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Nervous? Not at all! No. I've never <br>
              been more certain in my life. Except <br>
              -- I am having all kinds of weird <br>
              dreams.</p>
            <p> Ike pulls the cloth down from over his face.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Weird dreams? You're going to tell me <br>
              about them?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (calming)<br>
              Let's just put this back here for the <br>
              aromatherapy.</p>
            <p> Peggy recovers his face, then continues to fuss with the hair 
              <br>
              coloring products. Maggie helps.</p>
            <p> INT. BEAUTY PARLOR - LATER</p>
            <p> Ike sits with a towel over his head as Peggy blow-dries the back 
              <br>
              of his head. His back is to the mirror, his body faces Maggie. <br>
              Cindy does her own nails as Mrs. Pressman scratches off lottery 
              <br>
              tickets. The dog, Sprout, sits in is basket.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              In another one...</p>
            <p> PETE, wearing a hat, comes in the front door of the salon.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Hey, Pete, I'll be right with you.</p>
            <p> Ike peeks out from under his towel as Maggie continues.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'm inside the church. Everyone I know <br>
              is there, only they're not really them. <br>
              They're like Frankenstein monsters, but <br>
              without the bolts coming out of their <br>
              necks. It's all very &quot;Night of the <br>
              Living Dead&quot;. And here's the creepiest <br>
              part -- I look down at my dress and <br>
              it's red. I mean, I have no idea what <br>
              it means. Red's not my color!</p>
            <p> Ike listens intently and stares steadily into her eyes. Peggy 
              <br>
              removes the towel. His hair is divided into equal parts and <br>
              dyed orange and red.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              So what do you think?</p>
            <p> Ike stares back at her, the tickle of suspicion creeping up his 
              <br>
              spine.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I think you'd look good in red.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              No, she's talking about your hair.</p>
            <p> Maggie swivels his chair so that Ike faces the mirror. Ike <br>
              looks at his brightly colored hair.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You're all ready for football season, <br>
              Mr. Graham.</p>
            <p> Ike stares at his hair in total confusion. With icy calm, Ike 
              <br>
              rises from his chair and primps the end of his hair as if giving 
              <br>
              it the finishing touches. Then he sees his defaced newspaper <br>
              clipping and all becomes clear. He picks up the article and <br>
              shows it to everyone. Ike does a slow burn.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Yes, I think I nailed the personality <br>
              profile of the women of Hale.</p>
            <p> Ike turns and puts the clipping up on the mirror.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              (to Peggy)<br>
              My jacket, please.</p>
            <p> Peggy hands him his jacket.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              (sarcastically)<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> Ike moves toward the door. He spots Pete.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              (putting on jacket; <br>
              to Pete)<br>
              Excuse me, Pete, do you know a place <br>
              that sells shampoo... Strong shampoo?</p>
            <p> PETE<br>
              Doc's Pharmacy. Third and Elm. Tell <br>
              him Pete sent you. Want my hat?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No thanks.</p>
            <p> Ike smiles at Maggie and exits.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (to Peggy)<br>
              He seems crabby.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY</p>
            <p> In front of beauty salon, Maggie follows Ike out.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              If you're looking for Elm Street, it's <br>
              that way.</p>
            <p> She puts on her sunglasses.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> He walks the other way.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              If you came down here in the pursuit of <br>
              happiness, you might as well go back. <br>
              Because you can't make me feel bad.</p>
            <p> She stops walking and turns to Ike.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I'm not here to make you feel bad. I'm <br>
              here for vindication. In my heart...</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You have one?</p>
            <p> Ike walks back to Maggie.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I feel I'm right about you. You got me <br>
              fired, lady. You destroyed my <br>
              reputation and you screwed up my hair. <br>
              You chew men up, spit them out and <br>
              loved it. And I'm down here to satisfy <br>
              myself on that point.</p>
            <p> PASSERSBY stare at Ike's hair and giggle.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Did something happen to make you care <br>
              about reality?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Yes. Conviction. Conviction that I'm <br>
              onto the truth. You're going to do the <br>
              same thing to &quot;poor bastard number four&quot; <br>
              that you did to the last three. You're <br>
              going to run again. And I'm not <br>
              leaving until you do.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You're going to be very disappointed.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              We'll see.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got <br>
              to get back to work. I still have my <br>
              job.</p>
            <p> He stares at her for a beat, stung by her words.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I have nothing to hide, Mr. Graham. <br>
              Talk to whoever you want. You might <br>
              actually stumble upon a fact or two.</p>
            <p> Maggie walks away. Ike walks a few steps and stops at a KID on 
              <br>
              a bike.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Hey, kid, I'll give you ten bucks for <br>
              your hat.</p>
            <p> Kid agrees. Ike puts the hat on and starts to cross the street. 
              <br>
              An OLD WOMAN walks by and hits him with a newspaper. Ike is <br>
              stunned.</p>
            <p> EXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DUSK</p>
            <p> Maggie pulls into the driveway in her truck. She's in a fine <br>
              mood as she walks right in the house.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DUSK</p>
            <p> Bob, Walter, and Maggie's GRANDMOTHER JULIA sit in the living 
              <br>
              room. Grandma is sewing one of Maggie's wedding veils. Walter <br>
              drinks wine, Ike wears a hat.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              You know, when I only see one dog, I <br>
              know I've had too much to drink.</p>
            <p> Te family dog, Skipper, sits near a ceramic dog table. Maggie 
              <br>
              smiles as she walks in the front door and puts down her tool box 
              <br>
              and bag.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You'll never guess who came crawling <br>
              into town with his tail between his <br>
              legs.</p>
            <p> IKE (o.s.)<br>
              Who?</p>
            <p> Maggie enters the parlor to see Ike smiling evilly from his seat 
              <br>
              on the couch.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              (innocently)<br>
              Hello, Maggie. I just came by to <br>
              apologize to your family.<br>
              (looks to Walter)<br>
              When I'm wrong, I'm wrong. I pushed a <br>
              story. I made a mistake.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              In other words -- he's only human. An <br>
              he brought us a bottle of wine.</p>
            <p> Raises the bottle to Maggie.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              They made me put my hat back on.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              Oh, yeah. Scared the hell out of <br>
              Skipper.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You've got to be kidding me.</p>
            <p> Maggie stares at them both.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              (enjoying the moment)<br>
              No, no, you should have seen Skipper.<br>
              (then, imitates <br>
              growling)<br>
              It wasn't that funny.</p>
            <p> Maggie gives him a look that says, &quot;You are not absolved.&quot; 
              She <br>
              smiles stiffly, looking back at Ike. She then sits on the arm <br>
              of Bob's chair and puts her arm on his shoulder.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              So, the forces of good and evil have <br>
              already met.</p>
            <p> Maggie takes the wine bottle from the table next to Walter. She 
              <br>
              snaps a look to Bob, who follows her.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              I'll help you take into the kitchen.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              Check on the crabs, Bob.</p>
            <p> We overhear them murmuring in annoyed tones about the wedding 
              <br>
              plans as they exit... Walter puts down his drink.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out <br>
              there. You don't think they'll call it <br>
              off...?</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              Well, wedding cake freezes. This we <br>
              know.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You know, your daughter seems...</p>
            <p> Ike notices that he's been sewn to the veil.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              Sorry.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              That's okay, Grandma.</p>
            <p> Grandma cuts the thread and separates the veil from Ike's sleeve.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              (continuing his thought)<br>
              ... Like such a lovely girl.</p>
            <p> Walter points to a portrait painting on the wall.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              Like her mother.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (seeing the portrait)<br>
              Ah, beautiful.<br>
              (gets up to admire <br>
              the portrait)<br>
              I just can't see her leaving multiple <br>
              grooms in the dust like that.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              Oh, yes, you can. She's has 'em all on <br>
              tape.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              She has a tape?</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              (good-natured)<br>
              Yeah. Lee at the hotel videos wedding. <br>
              I mean Maggie didn't know she was going <br>
              to make the hundred-yard dash.</p>
            <p> Walter gestures to a pile of video cassettes on the bookcase. 
              <br>
              Ike checks on the tapes.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee <br>
              operation, Grandma's birthday...</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              Gotta tell you this about my daughter. <br>
              My daughter makes real good time, even <br>
              in a long dress and heels. Maggie may <br>
              not be Hale's longest running joke, but <br>
              she certainly is the fastest.</p>
            <p> Walter cracks up.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              (sarcastically)<br>
              Ha ha.</p>
            <p> CLOSE ON: A tape. It reads: &quot;Maggie I, II, III.&quot; Ike's 
              <br>
              interest is more than piqued. Ike picks it up. They get up and <br>
              go to the dining room.</p>
            <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
            <p> INT. DINNING ROOM/MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The family dog, Skipper, steals food from the table. Walter <br>
              scolds him. Walter whacks his crab with his hammer and Ike <br>
              copies him.</p>
            <p> WALTER (cont'd)<br>
              Emma and I were only blessed with one <br>
              child, not for lacking of trying.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              This is good, Dad, don't leave anything <br>
              out.</p>
            <p> Ike's hammer flies out of his hand. He goes to pick it up.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              So I've come to see it as a bonus, <br>
              really, that we've been able to plan, <br>
              and pay for, so many weddings.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Not this one. This one's on me.</p>
            <p> Walter reacts.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              That's fair.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Despite what you think, I don't do it <br>
              on purpose. And I have no intention of <br>
              doing it again.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              That's right, Maggie. Just keep your <br>
              eye on the ball.</p>
            <p> Ike raises his eyebrows in question. Bob explains.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              Sports psychology. It was my major in<br>
              college.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Ahh.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              (false modesty)<br>
              I'm the town's unofficial fitness <br>
              trainer. Big advocate of the mind and <br>
              body combining for success. You could <br>
              say or you can quote me, I'm a glass <br>
              half full king of guy.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (boasting)<br>
              Bob's the head of the P.E. department <br>
              at the high school. And he coaches the <br>
              football team. And he's climbed <br>
              Everest.</p>
            <p> To Maggie's satisfaction, Ike shoots Bob a look of begrudging 
              <br>
              respect. Nobody who's been up Everest is a total clown.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (impressed)<br>
              Everest. Is that right?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Twice...</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Really?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (sticking it to Ike)<br>
              Without oxygen...</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              My girl likes to brag about me.</p>
            <p> Bob and Maggie kiss Ike two little love-birds.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              I'm taking her trekking on Annapurna on <br>
              our honeymoon.</p>
            <p> Ike is highly amused.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              How romantic.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (sharply)<br>
              We think so.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed <br>
              with two Sherpas and a yak.</p>
            <p> Walter cracks up, Maggie shoots Ike a look. He smiles back.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM/INT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S BEDROOM (NYC)</p>
            <p> INTERCUT TELEPHONE CONVERSATION</p>
            <p> Fisher and Ellie are exercising. Fisher is on a cycle machine. 
              <br>
              Ellie does yoga stretches. Ike sits back on the couch, puts on <br>
              his glasses and watches a video taped wedding playing on the TV 
              <br>
              screen. Superimposed titles read &quot;Brian Norris wedding.&quot;</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (to Fisher; into phone)<br>
              You won't believe what I'm looking at, <br>
              Fisher. A videotape of all three train <br>
              wrecks.</p>
            <p> THE TV - CLOSE</p>
            <p> Two flower girls and Peggy enter a crowded church where the <br>
              groom, Brian, and his best man wait at the altar.</p>
            <p> Now we see Maggie come down the aisle, then walk past the altar. 
              <br>
              We see Maggie move away another aisle and out of the church. <br>
              SHOCKED WEDDING GUESTS rise in horror, as she runs from this <br>
              first wedding. She drags the train boy up the second aisle as <br>
              she leaves. Ike hangs up. He gets up to pick up the remote and <br>
              then sits back down to watch.</p>
            <p> The tape fast-forwards to the next wedding. Now Ike is looking 
              <br>
              at a much more relaxed, hipper, backyard wedding. It says, <br>
              &quot;Gill Chavez Wedding&quot;. He hits the fast-forward button 
              <br>
              (sometimes slowing down).</p>
            <p> ON TV:</p>
            <p> We see the Carpenter's backyard. It is Gill and Maggie's <br>
              wedding day. The yard is crowded with a MIXTURE of Hells <br>
              Angels-types, Deadheads and townspeople. The &quot;altar&quot; is 
              a band <br>
              platform against the back fence. <br>
              <br>
              Gill is waiting on the platform with a rock combo playing <br>
              Grateful Dead-type music. He makes an introductory speech. <br>
              <br>
              Maggie steps out onto the back porch. She's beautiful in a <br>
              hippie-type wedding ensemble. She walks with her father to a <br>
              trampoline. We can see her tattoo. She jumps on the trampoline, 
              <br>
              then dives into the crowd. They watch her and body surf her <br>
              over their heads to the back fence. <br>
              <br>
              As she hits the stage, she looks at Peggy and Gill, then decides 
              <br>
              to go. She jumps off the stage and runs up to a passing GUY on <br>
              a dirt bike. She jumps on and turns and waves as she rides <br>
              away. During the video, Ike scribbles: &quot;Gill Chavez&quot;. 
              Maggie <br>
              goes off on dirt bike. The tape fast-forwards to the last of <br>
              Maggie's fiascoes.</p>
            <p> ON IKE'STV</p>
            <p> He now sees the third wedding. It's outdoors, in a tree lined 
              <br>
              area, MUSICIANS plays. Ike laughs as he discovers that Maggie <br>
              approaches the altar on horseback, in a simple white dress, <br>
              wearing a crown of flowers. The Maid Marian look. Ike slows the 
              <br>
              tape.</p>
            <p> ON TV: IT SAYS, &quot;GEORGE SWILLING WEDDING&quot;.</p>
            <p> As Maggie rides down the aisle, suddenly the horse whinnies!</p>
            <p> Maggie has kicked it in the shins. It rears and bolts, <br>
              galloping off with the bride. Ike FREEZE FRAMES the tape on an <br>
              image of Maggie, hair blowing. Although she is panic-stricken, <br>
              her soul seems to shine through in tat single frame. As Ike <br>
              stares at her, the smirk fades from his face. He just looks at <br>
              her, allowing himself to see her expression, her eyes. He can't 
              <br>
              help it.</p>
            <p> She gets to him. Ike gets a restless look on his face. He <br>
              stares closely. The groom is George from the bar.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Kamikaze!</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. TE TROUT BAKERY - THE NEXT DAY</p>
            <p> Establishing. High angle wide shot of a bakery in Hale. Ike <br>
              exits a neighboring shop and walks down the block. He pauses in 
              <br>
              front of the bakery to take a look at Maggie's truck. As he <br>
              does, a middle-aged Black WOMAN walks by and whacks him with a <br>
              newspaper. Ike is stunned as she walks off. He turns to a MAN <br>
              sitting on a bench.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Did you see that?</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. THE TROUT BAKERY - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> CLOSE ON a group of plastic grooms and brides on a counter top.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT is behind the counter helping Maggie with a selection 
              <br>
              of grooms for her wedding cake. The groom figures are spread out 
              <br>
              on the counter. All sizes and colors, some attached to brides, <br>
              some solo, some tuxes, some in dinner jackets.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              This one's very popular, but oh, you've <br>
              used this one before... Brian. But I <br>
              like the white dinner jacket.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No, he's no good. Too blond.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              (picks up another)<br>
              We'll go with total traditional.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Too dark.</p>
            <p> Then, Ike comes up behind her as she discards another groom.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              But he's got the Bobster's eyes.</p>
            <p> Maggie cringes at the sound of Ike's voice.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              No -- the Bobster's eyes are closer set.</p>
            <p> She ignores him and continues her search.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              (to Mrs. Trout)<br>
              Could I have two coffees, please? And <br>
              what is that wonderful smell?<br>
              (seeing the <br>
              cinnamon rolls)<br>
              I'll have two of those delicious <br>
              looking cinnamon rolls.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              Sure.<br>
              (picking up a <br>
              miniature bride)<br>
              Here, Maggie. I think this makes the <br>
              best you.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Trout steps away to get his order. Ike moves to the other 
              <br>
              side of Maggie and picks up the bride and groom figure.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Let's see... Excuse me, isn't that cute? <br>
              Ahh...</p>
            <p> He makes the bride figure repeatedly knock the groom figure in 
              <br>
              the head and run away screaming.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam! Oh, help me! <br>
              Help me! Yup! That's her all right.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Trout just about bursts a gut laughing. Maggie takes the 
              <br>
              bride from Ike coldly.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              You must be that Mr. Graham fellow.</p>
            <p> Ike turns and goes to her.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Yes, I am. And who are you?</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              Betty Trout. Five dollars.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (as he pays)<br>
              Oh, Betty. I take it you're going to <br>
              be making the wedding cake and they say <br>
              you're throwing --</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              (interrupting)<br>
              -- The luau for Maggie.</p>
            <p> She starts picking lint off his sleeve and buttons his cuff.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (all smiles for <br>
              Mrs. Trout)<br>
              Grandma made me the cutest outfit. I <br>
              can't wait to show it to you.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (cynical delight)<br>
              A pre-wedding luau?</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              Yes. My husband and I love luaus. <br>
              It'll be fun.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Trout turns and grabs Ike's bag containing two coffees.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Fun? Fun isn't the word.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Trout beams. Maggie understands his answer a little better. 
              <br>
              Mrs. Trout hands Ike his items and he pays.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              If you're still in town, you should <br>
              stop by.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No, I'm sure he doesn't.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (to Mrs. Trout)<br>
              Actually, I would love to come.<br>
              (taps her service bell)<br>
              Thank you. Thank you so much.</p>
            <p> Maggie steps over, carrying her bride and groom figure choices.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (exasperated)<br>
              Is that what you're going to do now? <br>
              Follow me around everywhere I go?</p>
            <p> Ike smiles at Maggie enigmatically as he picks up his order and 
              <br>
              heads for the door.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> He starts to leave with his bag. Mrs. Trout stops him.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              (handing him the <br>
              other bag)<br>
              Your two cinnamon rolls.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Bye, Betty. Thanks.</p>
            <p> He leaves.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              He's not a nice person.</p>
            <p> Maggie hands Mrs. Trout her bride and broom figures. Maggie <br>
              looks at Mrs. Trout, suddenly nervous. She dashes out. Mrs. <br>
              Trout imitates Ike bamming the bride and groom, laughing.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY</p>
            <p> Various High School SPORTS TEAMS practice. Maggie strides across 
              <br>
              the football field, a scowl on her face. A few HIGH SCHOOL <br>
              FOOTBALL PLAYERS job past Maggie, doing laps. A boy, KENDALL, <br>
              calls out to her affectionately as she passes. One of them, <br>
              DENNIS, slows his pace to run alongside Maggie.</p>
            <p> DENNIS<br>
              (playful)<br>
              Maggie, don't marry Coach! Marry me. <br>
              I love you.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You're jail bait, Dennis. Go away. <br>
              Run your laps. Go. Go.</p>
            <p> Dennis runs on as Maggie continues toward her goal: Bob and Ike,<br>
              standing together on the other side of the field.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON BOB AND IKE</p>
            <p> They're both standing on the blocking sled. Wave after wave of 
              <br>
              VARSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS ram into the sled and drive it across <br>
              the field with both Ike and Bob on top of it. Ike is munching on 
              <br>
              one of the cinnamon rolls as Bob pushes the KIDS.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Drive! Drive! From your hips, get low, <br>
              get low, get low. Next!</p>
            <p> Ike smiles broadly atop of the sled as he sees Maggie <br>
              approaching, looking mighty peeved. He nudges Bob and points to 
              <br>
              Maggie. Bob lights up at the sight of her.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              Good job, gentlemen... Special teams.</p>
            <p> The football players move away from the sled. Bob moves to <br>
              Maggie, leaves Ike alone.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              (to Maggie)<br>
              Hey, honey!</p>
            <p> Bob kisses and embraces Maggie. She doesn't see Ike immediately, 
              <br>
              then:</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (indicating Ike)<br>
              What is he up to now?</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Ike just came by to check out the team.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              And talk about you.</p>
            <p> Ike grins and shows Maggie the notes in his pocket.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Bob -- are you making friends with this <br>
              man?</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              I'm just bragging about how great you <br>
              are. I'm the luckiest man alive.</p>
            <p> Bob grabs Maggie around the waist and smooches her adoringly. 
              <br>
              Maggie scowls at Ike. He nods, all charm.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Well -- I've got to get moving -- lot <br>
              of work to do today! I'll see you two <br>
              love-birds later.</p>
            <p> Ike leaves. Bob calls after him.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              See you at the wedding.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You bet ya, Coach.</p>
            <p> Maggie is aghast. She stares at Bob. Ike joins in behind a line 
              <br>
              of peppy cheerleaders.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              At the wedding? You invite him? Bob, <br>
              don't you realize he's writing another <br>
              article about me?</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Sure I do. But the bet defense is a <br>
              good offense, right? You're not going <br>
              to let your opponent throw you off <br>
              your game.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You don't understand this guy.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Let him come to the wedding. You're <br>
              not running, right? Say it. &quot;I'm <br>
              not...&quot;</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (irritably)<br>
              I'm not running.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              So if you're not running and Ike Graham <br>
              is there to see it, then any article he <br>
              writes has got to have a happy ending, <br>
              right? All we're doing is turning <br>
              lemon into lemonade.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I've got news for you. No amount of <br>
              sugar and water is going to turn like <br>
              Graham into something you want to take <br>
              on a picnic.</p>
            <p> Bob gives Maggie a big hug.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Where's that homemade sunshine?</p>
            <p> Bob blows his whistle, then puts Maggie on the football sled.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              I want you boys to take my princess on <br>
              the ride of her life... Honey, tell 'em <br>
              where you parked your car.</p>
            <p> Maggie screams as the boys push her down the football field.</p>
            <p> INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH/CHURCH - DAY</p>
            <p> Maggie kneels, hands folded reverently. The booth's grate opens 
              <br>
              before her.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. <br>
              My last confession was... ahh...</p>
            <p> She tries to recall.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              ... Anyway, I have sort of a technical <br>
              question here. I've been having -- bad <br>
              thoughts. I mean, really bad thoughts<br>
              ...</p>
            <p> PRIEST<br>
              Of an impure nature?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No -- like -- I'm having a problem with <br>
              that whole turn-the-other-cheek concept. <br>
              I want revenge. I want to destroy this <br>
              guy's life, career, everything. On the <br>
              sin scale, how big is that? I mean, <br>
              can I &quot;Hail Mary&quot; my way out of it?</p>
            <p> PRIEST<br>
              Child, any sin in one's heart is...</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (impatient)<br>
              The name's Maggie. It wasn't this side <br>
              of ten years ago that you had your <br>
              tongue down my throat. So don't call <br>
              me &quot;child&quot;, Brian. It annoys me.</p>
            <p> PRIEST/ BRIAN<br>
              Now don't get upset.</p>
            <p> Brian closes the confessional window and exits</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (still inside <br>
              the booth)<br>
              Brian, open up. Don't ignore me.</p>
            <p> Brian leans into her confessional. She steps out to join him.</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              You're not even Catholic, Maggie -- you <br>
              really shouldn't come to confession.</p>
            <p> He's a nice looking and gentle man. They regard each other for 
              a <br>
              beat.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'm sorry. I'm just so stressed out <br>
              about that slime-ball reporter being in <br>
              town. I jus had to come warn you he <br>
              might show up here and start asking you <br>
              all kinds of ridiculous questions.</p>
            <p> Brian moves away. Maggie follows and sits in a nearby pew.</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              Actually, he only asked me one <br>
              ridiculous question. The rest weren't <br>
              so bad.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (sliding along <br>
              the pew)<br>
              What? You talked to him! Did you tell <br>
              him we dated before you were a priest?</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, <br>
              Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              What did he ask?</p>
            <p> A woman, MRS. MURPHY, rushes in.</p>
            <p> MRS. MURPHY<br>
              Father, am I too late?</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              No, no.</p>
            <p> MRS. MURPHY<br>
              It won't take long. Jus two venials.</p>
            <p> The woman goes into the confessional booth to wait.</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              Only respectful things. What did we <br>
              have in common back then... What kind <br>
              of music did you like... Did you ruin <br>
              my life when you left me standing at <br>
              the altar...</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              And what did you say?</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              How could I be angry at you when <br>
              clearly what has happened to me is as <br>
              God intended?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (relieved)<br>
              Good one! Thanks.</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              It happens to be how I feel.</p>
            <p> Brian sits next to Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              God... Of course. I'm sorry -- I mean, <br>
              I'm...<br>
              (sighs)<br>
              Brian -- I've got to go. The man's a <br>
              lunatic, but I know exactly where he's <br>
              going next.</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              God bless you, Maggie.</p>
            <p> She turns to rush out, then stops herself.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Oh, wait, my purse.</p>
            <p> She moves to the confessional, knocks, then speaks to Mrs. Murphy.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Excuse me, sorry, forgot my purse. <br>
              Good luck.</p>
            <p> Maggie closes the booth curtain and turns to Brian.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Wait -- what was the ridiculous <br>
              question he asked?</p>
            <p> Brian smiles mischievously.</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              He wanted to know how you used to like <br>
              your eggs.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Weird. Like after all those years you <br>
              would remem--</p>
            <p> She starts to go, then stops in her tracks as she hears:</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              (interrupting)<br>
              -- Scrambled, with salt, pepper and <br>
              dill. Same as me.</p>
            <p> Maggie looks at Brian. Suddenly, she remembers too.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (tenderly)<br>
              I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to <br>
              be. But if you ever become a Catholic, <br>
              may I ask you a favor, Maggie?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Of course.</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              Could your confess to Father Patrick <br>
              from now on?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Of course.</p>
            <p> And she scampers out. Brian goes back into the confessional.</p>
            <p> EXT. GILL'S GARAGE - DAY</p>
            <p> Maggie drives up to an old brick firehouse that is now an auto 
              <br>
              garage. The faded sign reads: &quot;Gill's Garage&quot;.</p>
            <p> INT. GILL'S GARAGE - DAY</p>
            <p> Maggie rushes inside and looks around. No one is in sight. <br>
              Several cars, including a yellow jeep-like car up on a hydraulic 
              <br>
              lift, are in the funky garage.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Gill? Lydia? Gill?</p>
            <p> A CRASH, coming from the nearby back room, we hear loud muttering 
              <br>
              in Spanish, then out stumbles GILL CHAVEZ, 34, wearing a grease-<br>
              stained Grateful Dead tie-dyed T-shirt. He grins triumphantly, <br>
              worshipfully cradling a CASSETTE TAPE in his hands.</p>
            <p> GILL<br>
              Hey -- I found it!</p>
            <p> Maggie regards her former fiance with patient warmth.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Found what?</p>
            <p> Gill looks up and gives Maggie a fond, hazy smile.</p>
            <p> GILL<br>
              Mags! Hey, look -- The tape from the <br>
              Radio City Music Hall concert -- <br>
              Remember that night I as trying to get <br>
              Jerry to let me sit in on &quot;Ripple&quot;?</p>
            <p> He pulls out the cassette from its case. It's broken. The tape 
              <br>
              is dangling from the cassette.</p>
            <p> GILL (cont'd)<br>
              (disappointed)<br>
              Oh, I'll play it for you.</p>
            <p> Gill picks up an electric GUITAR and starts to play.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (shouts over the music)<br>
              Listen, Gill -- There's this reporter <br>
              who's ben making my life a living hell<br>
              ... If he comes by here, don't talk to <br>
              him. And whatever yo do....<br>
              (crosses to Gill)<br>
              ... Don't show him that picture of me <br>
              at the concert in San Francisco --</p>
            <p> Suddenly, a loud CHUCKLING emanates from the car overhead.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              What was that?</p>
            <p> Maggie stops Gill from playing. She shoots her ex an angry glare 
              <br>
              and moves a lever on the shop wall. With a HUM, the car descends.</p>
            <p> GILL<br>
              We went to San Francisco twice. <br>
              Remember one time we had a flat tire... <br>
              Which picture?</p>
            <p> As the hydraulic lift slows, the car is lowered, revealing Ike 
              <br>
              sitting in the driver's seat. He has been enjoying the <br>
              photograph he's holding.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (feigning shock)<br>
              Imagine! Maggie Carpenter topless in a <br>
              public arena.<br>
              (checks photo again)<br>
              And I see there was a chill in the air.</p>
            <p> Maggie swipes for the photo, but Ike is faster at pulling it away.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Give me that!</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              But the most interesting thing here is <br>
              that I don't see the rose tattoo that <br>
              I've heard about on your back.</p>
            <p> Gill takes off his guitar and sets it down.</p>
            <p> GILL<br>
              Ike bet me fifty bucks you don't still <br>
              have it, Mags. I said &quot;You're on, man! <br>
              Maggie loved that thing!&quot; And I could <br>
              really use fifty bucks.</p>
            <p> Maggie is conspicuously silent.</p>
            <p> GILL (cont'd)<br>
              (looking worried)<br>
              Mags?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'm not gonna show you guys anything. <br>
              I am a soon-to-be-married woman. Now <br>
              give me that photograph.</p>
            <p> Maggie seethes.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Sure, I would love to give this to you. <br>
              Just give us one quick gander at that <br>
              rose, and, I'll gladly hand it over.</p>
            <p> She tries to grab the photo again. Ike pulls it away.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Fine. Here.</p>
            <p> Maggie quickly turns around and pulls down the back of her shirt, 
              <br>
              revealing the top of her back and a pristine expanse of skin. No

              tattoo.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              (turning back around)<br>
              Satisfied?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Completely.</p>
            <p> Gill is still trying to grasp the meaning of this.</p>
            <p> GILL<br>
              Maggie? You got it removed?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Gill, I'll go ya double or nothing if <br>
              was a stick-on.</p>
            <p> GILL<br>
              (dismayed)<br>
              Maggie?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (admitting)<br>
              I'm really, really afraid of needles... <br>
              It doesn't make me a bad person.</p>
            <p> Ike laughs. Maggie looks at him with rage. Gill dramatically <br>
              pulls down the front of his t-shirt.</p>
            <p> GILL<br>
              Look.</p>
            <p> There it is on Gill's chest: the rose tattoo. Maggie sighs, <br>
              pained. Gill shows it to Ike. Ike looks at the tattoo. He <br>
              shakes his head at Maggie.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (sincerely)<br>
              Look, look, man. I think the man is <br>
              heartbroken.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              He is not!</p>
            <p> Maggie moves the lever on the wall again, sending Ike back up 
              to <br>
              the ceiling in the car. She grabs the photo from Ike and exits.</p>
            <p> GILL<br>
              I think I am.</p>
            <p> Gill grabs his guitar and sits.</p>
            <p> GILL (cont'd)<br>
              Hey, Ike, what would Jerry do?</p>
            <p> The hydraulic lift stops moving. Ike leans out.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Jerry. He'd play. He'd play... Jerry <br>
              would play his heart out.</p>
            <p> Ike sings and taps along in tempo on the side of the car as Gill 
              <br>
              sings and plays &quot;Ripple&quot;.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. HOTEL PORCH - NEXT DAY, SATURDAY MORNING</p>
            <p> As Maggie drives into town with Peggy, they see Ike on porch with 
              <br>
              SHERIFF, POLICE CHIEF and MAIL MAN, all playing instruments as <br>
              a blues band. Ike is not bad on slide guitar. They all like <br>
              Ike. <br>
              <br>
              Maggie &quot;CHUFFAS&quot; with Peggy and moves on.</p>
            <p> EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - LATER THAT DAY</p>
            <p> CLOSE ON:</p>
            <p> The slow, loopy pitch of a softball. A bat connects.</p>
            <p> NEW ANGLE:</p>
            <p> A big wholesome man, CORY, runs for first base. He just beats 
              <br>
              out the throw. Bob, acting as umpire, yells, &quot;Safe!&quot; Happy, 
              <br>
              Cory turns to the stands and waves.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Maggie and Peggy, cheering loudly. Peggy tries to whoop harder 
              <br>
              than Maggie, but that would be tough. From firs base, Cory waves 
              <br>
              back to them. The two women sit back down and Maggie takes back 
              <br>
              up with their conversation. Maggie is still al steamed up.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Okay, he's on base. Can we talk about <br>
              my life now? -- Ike's going to turn <br>
              that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- <br>
              that I was never serious about Gill, <br>
              blah blah. He's totally out to get me.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              For what reason? Some personal <br>
              satisfaction?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              That's what he says, but if he thinks <br>
              that I don't realize he's writing <br>
              another article, then he's an idiot.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              It's probably because you got him fired.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (sarcastic)<br>
              Ya think?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Not that he doesn't deserve to get <br>
              fired... Look! Cory's going for <br>
              second!... Sneaky!</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Cory as he runs for second base and with a slide beats the throw 
              <br>
              for the force out. The women jump and cheer -- Maggie, again, <br>
              the most boisterous.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Dennis recognizes Ike as he walks up. Dennis tells Ike that he 
              <br>
              is going to marry Maggie some day and shows Ike where Maggie is 
              <br>
              sitting.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Maggie spots Ike as they sit back down. She groans.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              There he is. Snoop Doggy-Dogg.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Where?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Over there. Ten o'clock. He's talking <br>
              to our little Dennis. Dennis will turn <br>
              into one of those &quot;sources say&quot; things.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              He looks better with that stuff out of <br>
              his hair. He's an attractive man.</p>
            <p> Ike finds Maggie in the crowd and leaves Dennis.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'd say you've been in the sun too long. <br>
              You handle him, okay? I could use five <br>
              minutes off from that creep.</p>
            <p> Before Peggy can protest, Maggie climbs down off the bleachers 
              <br>
              and goes and stands near the dugout near the rest of Cory's team.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Okay, that's fine. I can do that.</p>
            <p> Ike comes up to Peggy.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Hello, Peggy Phleming, &quot;not the ice-skater&quot;.</p>
            <p> Ike indicates the seat next to Peggy.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (protesting weakly)<br>
              That's Maggie's seat...</p>
            <p> Ike sits down comfortably.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              ... And this is Maggie's beer.</p>
            <p> He starts drinking it. ON THE FIELD, Cory is getting ready to 
              <br>
              steal third.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              That your husband out there? Cory <br>
              Phleming, a local radio announcer.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Have you listened to his morning show, <br>
              &quot;Wake up with ballplayer&quot;?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Not yet. I had a phlemless morning. I <br>
              hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              This game is pretty important to him. <br>
              He made all-stars in high school, you <br>
              know.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              That must have made you proud.</p>
            <p> Peggy takes a small sip off her soda.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              He was going with Maggie back then.<br>
              (quickly)<br>
              He was never one of her... I mean, they <br>
              were never going to get... They just <br>
              dated for a while.</p>
            <p> Cory dives in for third and makes it. The crowd goes wild. <br>
              Peggy yells and jumps in.</p>
            <p> PEGGY (cont'd)<br>
              Good job, honey!</p>
            <p> But Maggie's whoop sails out above it all. Cory waves. But not 
              <br>
              at Peggy. He directs his delight at Maggie, who jumps up and <br>
              down by the dugout.</p>
            <p> Ike looks between Cory, Maggie and finally, Peggy. Peggy jerks 
              <br>
              her waving hand back down to her side and sits down. Ike <br>
              pretends not to have noticed. The two watch as Maggie and Cory <br>
              smile at each other.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              It's nice that they're still friends.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (looking at Maggie <br>
              and Cory)<br>
              Oh, sure. That was a long time ago. <br>
              See, she's not a man-hater at all. <br>
              She's very supportive of men...</p>
            <p> Next BATTER hits one to deep left field and it lands in the grave<br>
              yard. Cory scores, greeted by Maggie. Ike and Peggy watch as <br>
              Cory and Maggie belly-bump and high-five each other in <br>
              celebration of Cory's play. No looks at Peggy. Ike keeps an <br>
              empathetic silence, seeing that Peggy is truly hurt.</p>
            <p> PEGGY (cont'd)<br>
              I'll be back in a second.</p>
            <p> Suddenly, Peggy stands, pushes past him and runs down the steps. 
              <br>
              Maggie looks up just in time to catch Peggy's exit. Ike pulls <br>
              his tape recorder out of his pocket and starts speaking into it.</p>
            <p> Maggie shoots Ike an accusing look, walks up to him in the <br>
              bleachers and sits next to him.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You've been here for three minutes. <br>
              What did you do to her?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You can turn that finger around.</p>
            <p> Ike does an on-the-button imitation of Maggie jumping excitedly 
              <br>
              at Cory. Now Maggie sees what he's getting at.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (defensive)<br>
              You misinterpret everything. We've all <br>
              been friends our whole lives. But <br>
              that's the types of relationship you <br>
              wouldn't understand.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Obviously, I'm not the only one who <br>
              doesn't understand it. The USS Maggie <br>
              leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.</p>
            <p> Ike walks away. Alone, Maggie tries to seem enthused.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              See, I cheer good. What is he, a cheer <br>
              critic?</p>
            <p> EXT./INT. STREET/BAR - LATER - DUSK</p>
            <p> Sitting in front of Inn Hale Bar, we see the BARTENDER <br>
              pantomiming holding the reins of a wildly galloping horse. We've 
              <br>
              seen something like this before. Maggie's wild ride away from <br>
              her last wedding. Ike laughs with Bartender just as Maggie <br>
              drives by the bar and sees this.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (to herself)<br>
              This guy never stops.</p>
            <p> INT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Maggie walks up to the front desk of the hotel, where Lee is <br>
              sleeping with his feet up. She knocks his feet off the counter.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Lee, hey, wake up. Give me the key to <br>
              the reporter's room. I want to snoop <br>
              around.</p>
            <p> LEE<br>
              (handing her the key)<br>
              Okay. Second floor.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Thanks.</p>
            <p> LEE<br>
              Don't take anything big.</p>
            <p> Maggie moves up the stairs towards Ike's room.</p>
            <p> INT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER</p>
            <p> Maggie walks towards Ike's room, checks that no one sees her and 
              <br>
              enters.</p>
            <p> INT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> Maggie lets herself in the modest room and turns on the lights 
              <br>
              on. She spots on audio cassette on the desk near the door. She <br>
              holds the cassette up to the light to read the hand-written <br>
              label. It says &quot;Miles Davis&quot; on it. She pockets the tape. 
              She <br>
              walks to the living room.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE'S POV:</p>
            <p> Ike has placed post-its on a framed picture, using the frame as 
              a <br>
              bulletin board. Post-it notes lay out the information he has <br>
              gathered under headings and subheadings. Parents &quot;Mother&quot; 
              <br>
              deceased, subheaded by &quot;Walter&quot; and there is one for &quot;Brian&quot;, 
              <br>
              &quot;Gill&quot;, and &quot;Bob&quot;. Maggie smiles and shakes 
              her head. She rips <br>
              one post-it down and reads it to herself.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (reads)<br>
              &quot;How does she get all these guys to <br>
              propose? She's not that beautiful.&quot;<br>
              (snorts)<br>
              Bite me, paper boy.</p>
            <p> She begins ripping many of other post-it off the picture frame.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              (as she takes post-its)<br>
              Rude...</p>
            <p> She's ripping them down, fast and furious, then shoves them in 
              <br>
              her shoulder bag.</p>
            <p> INT. ATLANTIC HOTEL HALLWAY - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> Ike comes down hallway as Harvey puts his shoes out to be shined.</p>
            <p> BACK INSIDE THE ROOM</p>
            <p> Maggie, looking around, discovers the wedding video on the <br>
              coffee table and grabs that, too.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Thief!</p>
            <p> THE SOUND OF A KEY IN THE DOOR makes Maggie jump. She flees to 
              <br>
              the bathroom, and shuts and locks the door. Just as Ike enters, 
              <br>
              he sniffs and looks around the room, instantly knowing something 
              <br>
              is up. He sees all his notes gone and a glimpse of Maggie as she 
              <br>
              closes the bathroom door. Ike is steaming. A BUMP sounds from <br>
              the bathroom. He goes over to the door and tries the handle. <br>
              It's locked. He starts to pound on the door.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              All right, I know you're in there... <br>
              You steal my research... You're messing <br>
              with the first amendment now. Open up. <br>
              Open up. You got no place to go.</p>
            <p> INT. IKE'S HOTEL BATHROOM - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> Ike's wrong. Maggie is already trying to open the first <br>
              bathroom window. It's stuck. She climbs over the bathtub, <br>
              opens that window and starts to climb out.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I want to have a very serious discussion <br>
              with you as to why you're such a pain in <br>
              the ass.</p>
            <p> We HEAR Ike slamming his body against the bathroom door.</p>
            <p> As Ike breaks in, he runs to the window and yells after her.</p>
            <p> EXT. IKE'S HOTEL WINDOW - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              That's breaking and entering. I'll call <br>
              the sheriff.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You do that. And remind him he's <br>
              bringing the wine to the luau. Thanks.</p>
            <p> She disappears around the ledge of the building and runs off. 
              <br>
              Ike's neighbor, Harvey, sits reading near his window.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>

            <p> Establishing.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> CLOSE ON: A CASSETTE PLAYER. We see the familiar handwritten <br>
              label: &quot;Miles Davis.&quot; &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; plays as 
              Maggie listens in <br>
              a chair, looking shell-shocked, surrounded by the post-its she <br>
              stole from Ike's room. We see as she reads them: &quot;Father, two-<br>
              fisted drinker,&quot; &quot;Peggy, best friend, but Peggy doesn't 
              totally <br>
              trust Maggie,&quot; &quot;Bob&quot; -- doesn't love him. Overwhelmed, 
              she <br>
              finishes reading the last note, leans back, puts her feet up on 
              <br>
              the table, deep in the mood of the melancholy music. </p>
            <p> The CAMERA MOVES on the last note on the floor next to her chair. 
              <br>
              It reads: &quot;SHOWS NO REMORSE&quot;.</p>
            <p> FADE TO BLACK.</p>
            <p> FADE IN:</p>
            <p> EXT. MAIN STREET/BEAUTY PARLOR - NEXT DAY</p>
            <p> It's early morning. Mrs. Pressman hands Peggy a cup of coffee 
              <br>
              to go. Peggy walks to the beauty parlor, unlocks the front door 
              <br>
              and goes in.</p>
            <p> INT. BEAUTY PARLOR - DAY</p>
            <p> Peggy enters and starts about her opening duties. She turns on 
              <br>
              the lights and turns and sees her friend, Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Do you think I flirt with Cory?</p>
            <p> Peggy stops in her track. Maggie is sitting curled up in a salon 
              <br>
              chair. She looks like she hasn't slept.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Good morning to you, too. You look good.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Thank you. Do you think I flirt with <br>
              Cory?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> Maggie looks miserable.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I don't mean it.</p>
            <p> Peggy moves to the salon mirror near Maggie with her cup of <br>
              coffee.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              I know. I think sometimes you just <br>
              sort of spaz-out with random excess <br>
              flirtation energy and it just lands on <br>
              anything male that moves.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              On anything male that moves? As <br>
              opposed to anything male that doesn't <br>
              move?</p>
            <p> Peggy pours her coffee out of its Styrofoam cup into a ceramic 
              mug.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Like certain kinds of coral.</p>
            <p> Peggy sits in the salon chair next to Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'm going to kill myself.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Why?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Because you think I'm all like... &quot;Hey <br>
              man, check me out&quot;.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (friendly)<br>
              No, I don't think you're like, &quot;I'm <br>
              charming and mysterious in a way that <br>
              even I don't understand and something <br>
              about me is crying out for protection <br>
              from a big man like you&quot;. Very hard <br>
              to compete with. Especially to us <br>
              married women who have lost our mystery.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              But you haven't lost your mystery! <br>
              You're very mysterious!</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              No. I'm weird. Weird and mysterious <br>
              are two different things.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              But I'm weird.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              No. You're quirky. Quirky and weird <br>
              are two different things.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Peggy, there's distinct possibility <br>
              that I might be profoundly and <br>
              irreversibly screwed up. Despite that, <br>
              I love you and I can promise that I <br>
              will no longer flirt with Cory, and I <br>
              beg your forgiveness.</p>
            <p> Maggie looks ready to cry.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              I'm not worried about you and Cory or <br>
              Cory and me or even that you're <br>
              irreversibly screwed up. But, Maggie, <br>
              you've been like this since we were <br>
              kids. And I think now that you are <br>
              aware of it and that it hurts people's <br>
              feelings, maybe it's time to move on <br>
              with your life and commit to someone of <br>
              your own, like Bob, if he's the one.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I think you're right.<br>
              (then)<br>
              Is there anything I can do to make it <br>
              up to you?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Something that brings warmth to my heart.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              Duckbill platypus.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at <br>
              three in the morning at a tick hunt. <br>
              It's not anymore.</p>
            <p> Maggie makes her funny face. Peggy doesn't laugh. </p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              You're right. It's not funny now. <br>
              Maybe we both grew up.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Thanks. Will you fix my hair?</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - LATER THAT MORNING</p>
            <p> Maggie exits her house, gets on her bike and rides off towards 
              <br>
              town.</p>
            <p> INT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER THAT MORNING</p>
            <p> Ike is still in bed. He slowly blinks awake, stretches, and is 
              <br>
              about to throw off the covers when Maggie's voice breaks the <br>
              silence.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Freeze. Hold on to those covers -- I <br>
              didn't come here to see Ike Junior.</p>
            <p> Maggie smiles cheerfully at Ike from the foot of the bed. He <br>
              narrows his eyes at her.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I take it the desk clerk is one of your <br>
              many admirers.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (deadpan)<br>
              How do I do it? I'm not that beautiful.</p>
            <p> Ike notices Maggie is holding two coffees.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Coffee. Now.</p>
            <p> Maggie hands it to him.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You're welcome. Your notes made <br>
              interesting bedtime reading -- if you <br>
              like trashy fiction. Your observations <br>
              are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. <br>
              You must be very proud.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I'm not a boastful man. What's your <br>
              point?</p>
            <p> Ike puts a shirt on as Maggie speaks.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              My point is that one again, you're <br>
              getting it all wrong. That won't <br>
              improve your reputation any, and it's <br>
              not very flattering to me either. So, <br>
              I'm going to give you a chance to write <br>
              the truth.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Really.</p>
            <p> Maggie turns away from him as he dresses.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I've decided to cooperate and let you <br>
              interview me.<br>
              (beat)<br>
              For a thousand bucks.</p>
            <p> Ike clears his throat as he stands putting his pants on.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              I want a big wedding and a killer dress <br>
              and for a grand I will answer all your <br>
              questions and let you follow me around.</p>
            <p> Ike takes his coffee with him as he picks up his glasses, puts 
              <br>
              them on and crosses to the window.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              My magazine doesn't pay because for <br>
              stories. It's not what you call ethical.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Oh, but making up the facts as you go <br>
              along is ethical? Actually, I meant <br>
              you. You probably got severance or <br>
              expenses or both. I'll take your check. <br>
              No credit cards.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (to Maggie)<br>
              You've seen the post-its. I've already <br>
              got more juicy material than I need. <br>
              Why should I pay you dollar one?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Because I think you're writing on spec <br>
              and with a first person interview, you <br>
              might actually sell that thing.</p>
            <p> Ike knows she's right.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Too much.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Seven-fifty.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Five hundred.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Six-fifty.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Done.</p>
            <p> Scowling, he writes out the check and hands it to her. Maggie 
              <br>
              looks at it and smile sweetly.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike jogs alongside of Maggie on her bike. Maggie parks her bike 
              <br>
              and they go inside her door to the house.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S FOYER AND STAIRS - DAY</p>
            <p> Maggie leads Ike upstairs to her workroom.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Pardon the mess. I haven't cleaned <br>
              since the fifth grade.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S WORKROOM - LATER</p>
            <p> Insert on a cappuccino machine. We PULL BACK and see Maggie and 
              <br>
              Ike standing at her work table. An automatic cappuccino maker <br>
              stands on the table. Its base is made from a used paint mixing <br>
              machine. It looks very shiny and futuristic. Maggie's logo <br>
              &quot;MAG&quot; is on the side. The machine shakes as it steams 
              the <br>
              cappuccino. Ike notices another homemade machine on the table.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              What's this over here?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              It's a birthday present for my cousin. <br>
              Put your finger in.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Cindy the manicurist.</p>
            <p> He puts his finger in the wrong hole of the machine.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No, the other one.</p>
            <p> He puts his finger in the correct hole. She turns it on. The <br>
              brushes rotate.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (laughing)<br>
              This is wonderful. You reconfigure all <br>
              these industrial parts and you do <br>
              something amazing with it.</p>
            <p> He looks around and spots some gadgets and lamps on another table. 
              <br>
              He walks to them.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              Amazing. Found industrial stuff. <br>
              Willow lamp... Rasta lamp...</p>
            <p> He picks up one of the many logos on the counter. Each boasts 
              a <br>
              &quot;MAG&quot; logo.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              Is this your preferred logo?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I think so.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I like it. This whole thing is pretty <br>
              incredible.<br>
              (studying a lamp)<br>
              I think you could probably sell this <br>
              lamp idea in New York.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Maybe someday.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You afraid to try?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (stares at him)<br>
              No, I'm not afraid. Just... Maybe <br>
              someday.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Well, I'm impressed. Absolutely <br>
              incredible.<br>
              (sitting)<br>
              I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this <br>
              isn't exactly a woman's room.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              What an incredible chauvinistic <br>
              observation.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S LIVING ROOM - A BIT LATER THAT DAY</p>
            <p> Maggie's showing Ike engagement rings.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              That's Brian's. He took me ut canoeing <br>
              on the lake and gave me the ring in a <br>
              velvet box.</p>
            <p> Ike snores. Maggie hits him.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              (defensive)<br>
              It was classic.</p>
            <p> Maggie hands Ike another ring. This one is in the shape of a <br>
              Grateful Dead rose.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Gill. Of course. He proposed at the <br>
              tie-dye t-shirt stand at a Dead concert. <br>
              It was very sweet until he hallucinated <br>
              that the drum set was a blood-sucking <br>
              space alien.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Always a mood killer.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Still sweet.</p>
            <p> Maggie hands Ike a third ring. It's in the shape of a butterfly 
              <br>
              and studded with multi-color gems.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              George. He proposed at a butterfly <br>
              farm in St. Thomas. The ring was <br>
              inside a cocoon.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (grimacing)<br>
              It's a little &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; <br>
              for me. I can't believe you waited for <br>
              the wedding to run.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              He's an entomologist! I thought it was <br>
              very unique.</p>
            <p> Now Maggie shows Ike the ring on her hand. It's a gold &quot;#1&quot; 
              with <br>
              a diamond set into the number.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              And here we are at Bob. He proposed <br>
              during the seventh inning stretch...</p>
            <p> Ike touches her hand to examine the ring more closely. Her <br>
              surprise at his touch shows on her face as she finishes her <br>
              sentence.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              ... At an Oriole's game.</p>
            <p> She takes her hand down. Ike steps away.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Wait. Don't tell me. The scoreboard <br>
              lit up with &quot;Mary me, Maggie.&quot;</p>
            <p> Ike picks up his cup of cappuccino and moves behind the couch.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              It was one of the most wonderful <br>
              moments of my life. Cal Ripken even <br>
              applauded.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (stopping)<br>
              Highly suspect.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              What do you mean? It was incredibly <br>
              romantic!</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got <br>
              to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.</p>
            <p> Ike moves back to the couch.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              I think the most anybody can honestly <br>
              say is, &quot;Look...&quot;<br>
              (sits on the arm <br>
              of the couch)<br>
              &quot;I guarantee that we'll have tough <br>
              times. I guarantee that at some point <br>
              one or both of us will want to get out <br>
              of this thing. But I also guarantee <br>
              that if I don't ask you to be mine, <br>
              I'll regret it for the rest of my life. <br>
              Because I know in my heart -- you're <br>
              the only one for me&quot;</p>
            <p> Maggie stares at Ike for a beat. His words have taken a little 
              <br>
              bit of her breath away. She covers.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I like it.</p>
            <p> She moves from the fireplace to a chair and sits.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              I'd like it better on a scoreboard.<br>
              (lightly)<br>
              Is that how you proposed when you asked <br>
              your wife to marry you?</p>
            <p><br>
              Ike is taken aback.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Don't look so surprised, you've got <br>
              divorce written all over you.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I'm a work in progress.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              So? Is that what you said to her?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No. I think I said something eloquent <br>
              like, &quot;So, uh -- maybe we should, ya <br>
              know. What do you think?&quot;</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Now that's romantic. A proposal like <br>
              that and you didn't find eternal bliss? <br>
              What went wrong?</p>
            <p> Ike takes a swallow of cappuccino.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I don't know.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You don't know.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Maybe you should ask her some time. <br>
              Ever thought of that?</p>
            <p> Ike is restless. He stands up.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Call me crazy, but I believe that check <br>
              I gave you entitles me to ask the <br>
              questions for a while.</p>
            <p> Ike puts down his cup of coffee, gets his tape recorder and sits 
              <br>
              close to Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Fair enough.<br>
              (thinks a beat)<br>
              Actually...</p>
            <p> Maggie move to TV. She picks up Ike's stolen post-it notes and 
              <br>
              her wedding video on top of the TV, and goes to the front door.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              I'll just need one more day to make sure <br>
              your check clears.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Ow!</p>
            <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. HALE STREET - THE NEXT DAY</p>
            <p> Ike and Maggie drive in Maggie's truck. They pull up in front 
              of <br>
              a Bridal Shop.</p>
            <p> A spectacular dress fills the small window. It's beautiful, <br>
              romantic, sexy. Maggie and Ike can be seen in the reflection.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Even with everything that's happened <br>
              I've still never been married and I <br>
              still deserve a beautiful dress.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Agreed.</p>
            <p> Maggie gives Ike a smile that lights up the sky. They go inside.</p>
            <p> INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY</p>
            <p> The place is fairly large and prosperous, probably the place to 
              <br>
              go in the Tri-County area. A little FLOWER GIRL, 10, is being <br>
              fitted on the pedestal in the middle of the room. A saleswoman, 
              <br>
              POLLY, has taken the flower girl under her wing. They are both <br>
              under the expert eyes of a stern looking woman, MRS. WHITTENMEYER, 
              <br>
              the shop owner. Also, the girl's MOTHER is there watching.</p>
            <p> POLLY<br>
              (to the mother)<br>
              She'll be the prettiest little flower <br>
              girl in your daughter's wedding.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Mr. Whittenmeyer. Hi, Polly!</p>
            <p> The flower girl sees Maggie and runs and hides behind Polly.</p>
            <p> POLLY<br>
              Hi, Maggie. You'll have to excuse her, <br>
              Maggie. Some of the children are <br>
              afraid of you since you dragged that <br>
              little boy up the aisle.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I didn't drag.<br>
              (then to the girl)<br>
              He tripped on his shoelaces.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Whittenmeyer comes forward to greet Maggie.</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              You've come for your dress. Good! <br>
              I'll get it from the back.</p>
            <p> Maggie leads her to the front window.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (happily)<br>
              Actually, I would like to get this dress.</p>
            <p> She points to the dress. She smiles back to Mrs. Whittenmeyer, 
              <br>
              expecting her to share her joy. Mrs. Whittenmeyer darkens.</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              (to Polly)<br>
              Polly, take Leslie into change.<br>
              (then, to Maggie)<br>
              But the one you have on hold is lovely.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (pleasantly)<br>
              Yes. But I've changed my mind.</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              It's one thousand dollars.</p>
            <p> Maggie is keenly aware of Ike listening in.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I have one thousand dollars.</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              (firmly)<br>
              The other one is only three hundred <br>
              dollars.</p>
            <p> Maggie lowers her voice, hoping to lessen the humiliation of the 
              <br>
              moment.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Is this dress for sale?</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              It just seems like an awful lot of <br>
              money to spend on one of your dresses, <br>
              Maggie... You only wear them for about <br>
              ten minutes.</p>
            <p> Ike watches with regret as Maggie's child-like enthusiasm <br>
              drains away, her happy mood crushed by the tactless assault of <br>
              the shop owner. He's starting to see that it's no always easy <br>
              being Maggie. There's a tremor in her voice.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yeah, that's a good point.<br>
              (then, sitting)<br>
              The other dress is nice.</p>
            <p> Ike calls out to Mrs. Whittenmeyer.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Mrs. Whittenmeyer. May I talk to you <br>
              for a second?</p>
            <p> She walks over to him.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              I don't know much about this kind of <br>
              thing. I'm from out of town. You're a <br>
              salesperson, right? You're here to <br>
              sell wedding dresses.</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              (huffy)<br>
              Yes. I've been here for thirty years.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Perfect. Because Miss Carpenter is <br>
              here to buy one. But not just any one. <br>
              She wants that one.</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              It's a thousand dollars!</p>
            <p> Ike goes over and takes the mannequin out of the window. Mrs. 
              <br>
              Whittenmeyer catches the wig as he puts the mannequin under his 
              <br>
              arm.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              Look, Aunt Bea, we're buying this <br>
              beautiful dress and anything else she <br>
              wants or I'm coming back here with a <br>
              squirt gun filled with India ink.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Whittenmeyer wilts under Ike's fierce gaze. She turns to 
              <br>
              Maggie.</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              Will he really do that?</p>
            <p> Maggie gives her a look.</p>
            <p> MR. WHITTENMEYER (cont'd)<br>
              (to Maggie)<br>
              Well, why don't you pick out some <br>
              accessories while I get this ready, <br>
              dear. Polly, will you come help me, <br>
              please?</p>
            <p> Polly comes to help carry the mannequin away.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON POLLY AND MRS. WHITTENMEYER:</p>
            <p> POLLY<br>
              (whispering to Mrs. Whittenmeyer)<br>
              It's a thousand dollars.</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              Shhhh! The man has ink!</p>
            <p> Maggie looks gratefully at Ike.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Tough to spend money in this town.</p>
            <p> TIME CUT: A FEW MINUTES LATER:</p>
            <p> Ike sits as he hears Maggie's voice behind him.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (o.s.)<br>
              What do you think?</p>
            <p> Ike turns around. Maggie is standing on the pedestal, wearing 
              <br>
              the dress and looking unbelievably gorgeous. She is overwhelming 
              <br>
              to behold and Ike has to struggle to keep his face under control.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (stammering)<br>
              You look... uh... You look fine.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Fine. The newspaper's upside down. <br>
              That's better than fine.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Bob will be very happy.</p>
            <p> She glows. Then the moment between them is broken as she <br>
              suddenly remembers something and grabs the veil off her head.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Bob! I almost forgot! I have to meet <br>
              Bob!</p>
            <p> INT. DINER - DAY</p>
            <p> This is a great place -- a major hub of social life in Hale. The 
              <br>
              food is greasy and good, Mrs. Pressman is the waitress, and the 
              <br>
              CROWD the essence of what is wonderful about a small town. Bob, 
              <br>
              Maggie and Ike sit on the counter. Mrs. Pressman CHUFFS about <br>
              the luau, then moves around the corner.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Mrs. Pressman, I think we're ready to <br>
              order.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              We're out the special because <br>
              somebody...<br>
              (indicates COOK with head)<br>
              ... didn't order enough sausage.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Let me have the garden omelette. Egg <br>
              whites only.</p>
            <p> Ike looks at Maggie. He'd bet a thousand bucks on what she'd say 
              <br>
              next.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'll have the same.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (clears his throat)<br>
              Of course.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              What was that? I can't order my eggs <br>
              without sarcasm?</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Neutral corners you two. You're on the <br>
              same team now. Any more fighting and <br>
              it's fifteen minutes in the penalty box.<br>
              (gently, to Ike)<br>
              Maggie's the nicest person you'll ever <br>
              meet. But she's always focusing out <br>
              there. She's got to start focusing <br>
              more in here.<br>
              (taps his chest)<br>
              That's why she's had some -- whatever <br>
              you want to call it -- problems in the <br>
              past.<br>
              (to Maggie)<br>
              That's what we're working on -- focus. <br>
              Right, Maggie? Focus on Maggie. Focus <br>
              on Bob.</p>
            <p> As Bob has been talking, Ike has been watching Maggie's face. 
              <br>
              The joy seems to have drained out of her.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (quietly)<br>
              Right.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              (to Ike)<br>
              I lead Maggie through a visualization <br>
              exercise. All the sports shrinks use <br>
              this head stuff. Visualize the end <br>
              zone, if you catch my drift.</p>
            <p> Bob takes out a notepad and hands it to Maggie.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              Here's today's mantra: &quot;It's an open <br>
              field to Big Bob.&quot;</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Tell me. When you get to the altar, <br>
              will you spike the bouquet?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You know, there's no...</p>
            <p> Before Maggie can finish, Ike intercepts her.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Well, I'm off. A reporter's work is <br>
              never done.<br>
              (heading to the door)<br>
              Mrs. Pressman, thank you.</p>

            <p> INT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA (V.O.)<br>
              I'd like to explain about the weddings. <br>
              There are reasons why they didn't come <br>
              off. Three weddings, no &quot;I do's&quot;. You <br>
              can't believe how much cake we were <br>
              left with. I should weigh three <br>
              hundred pounds. I don't think her <br>
              father minded spending so much money on <br>
              booze that nobody drank.</p>
            <p> We hear Grandma as through the hotel doors, we see Maggie exit 
              <br>
              the diner. She gets a bag from inside the cab of her truck and <br>
              comes inside the hotel where she finds Ike talking to Grandma, <br>
              who is having tea with her friend, NETTA.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Ike... Hi, Grandma.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Gram here was going to give me the <br>
              skinny on why you run from marital <br>
              bliss.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              Right, cover your ears, Netta. It's <br>
              not that she's afraid of the wedding, <br>
              she's afraid of the wedding night. <br>
              Innocent girls are terrified of &quot;the <br>
              one-eyed snake&quot;.<br>
              (getting into it)<br>
              Why, when I was a virgin bride, I took <br>
              a knitting needle with me into the bed...</p>
            <p> Ike winces.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Actually, Grandma, I charmed the one-<br>
              eyed snake awhile ago.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              Oh, yeah, I forgot. I'll tell you one <br>
              thing, your grandpa didn't forget that <br>
              wedding night.<br>
              (no Netta)<br>
              You can take your hands off your ears, <br>
              Netta. Your tea's getting cold.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Can you excuse us a minute?<br>
              (then to Ike)<br>
              May I have a word with you, please?</p>
            <p> Maggie moves toward door.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Bye, Netta... Bye, Grandam.</p>
            <p> He steps over to Maggie in the doorway.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I found this and didn't know if it was <br>
              something interesting.</p>
            <p> Maggie hands Ike a 30-year-old LP: Miles Davis' &quot;Kind of 
              Blue.&quot;</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (excited)<br>
              Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis. This <br>
              is &quot;King of Blue&quot;! This is the <br>
              original recording. Hard to find in <br>
              good condition. Where did you find <br>
              this?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (casual)<br>
              It was in the attic. It was jus <br>
              sitting there gathering dust.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              It's valuable. Hang onto it.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No. You take it.</p>
            <p> She steps outside, leaving Ike with the record.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music <br>
              I like and then finding me a rare album. <br>
              You're not trying to soften me up, are <br>
              you?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No -- I'm cleaning an attic. I <br>
              wouldn't attempt the impossible.</p>
            <p> She turns and walks back to the diner where Mrs. Pressman is <br>
              outside watering plants. Ike looks after Maggie and then back <br>
              down at the record in his hand. Somehow it makes him sad.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. IKE'S CAR - LATER THAT DAY</p>
            <p> Ike drives through Hale gobbling french fries from the fast food 
              <br>
              bag in his lap. Ike passes THE INN HALE BAR, same dump of a <br>
              tavern he talked to bartender at.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: MAGGIE'S CAR parked a few cars down. He pulls over <br>
              and parks. He gets out and speaks into his tape recorder.</p>
            <p> INT./EXT. THE INN HALE BAR -- DAY</p>
            <p> Ike approaches the window of the bar. There's a DRUNK MAN and 
              a <br>
              DOG sitting outside. Inside, we see two figures from the back, <br>
              arms around each other. One is definitely Maggie. The other is <br>
              definitely not Bob.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (coaxing)<br>
              C'mon. Let's go.</p>
            <p> As Maggie helps the man get up, we see that it's Walter, Maggie's 
              <br>
              father -- dead drunk.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              (belligerently)<br>
              I haven't had any fun since you got <br>
              your driver's license...</p>
            <p> They stumble and lurch, exiting the bar toward Maggie's car.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'm not exactly having fun, either... <br>
              Steady.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              (to Dog)<br>
              Good boy, Port Hole.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              I changed it.<br>
              (then to Drunk)<br>
              See you later, Mr. Travis.<br>
              (then to Maggie)<br>
              That guy has a problem... Maggie, you <br>
              can run everyone's life but your own.</p>
            <p><br>
              Maggie's having trouble keeping him steady as she opens the car 
              <br>
              door. Ike is there in a flash to help her pull Walter into the <br>
              car.</p>
            <p> WALTER (cont'd)<br>
              Good daughters let their fathers pass <br>
              out.</p>
            <p> Walter passes out on the front seat.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (without difficulty)</p>
            <p> Ike... Please don't write anything <br>
              about this --</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No. Forget about it. Don't even think <br>
              about it.</p>
            <p> Maggie looks at him with real gratitude. She swings the car <br>
              door shut.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Watch your leg, Dad.<br>
              (then to Ike)<br>
              I'm so tired of this.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Why don't you let him sleep it off in <br>
              the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. <br>
              Then we'll come back for him.<br>
              (to Drunk on bench)<br>
              Keep an eye on him.</p>
            <p> DRUNK MAN<br>
              I'm too loaded.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I was talking to the dog.<br>
              (turning to Maggie)<br>
              All right?</p>
            <p> Maggie thinks about this for a moment. She takes a deep breath.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Okay... I'll just grab my jacket.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. ROAD - LATE DUSK TO NIGHT</p>
            <p> Establishing of Ike's car driving.</p>
            <p> INT. IKE'S CAR - LATE DUSK TO NIGHT</p>
            <p> Maggie and Ike ride along.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              My dad managed a business and two <br>
              mistresses. He wanted me to be a <br>
              novelist. More?</p>
            <p> Maggie nods,</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              My mother wanted me to become a <br>
              musician. 0 for two. But at least <br>
              I'm a journalist and we all know <br>
              journalism is literature in a hurry.</p>
            <p> EXT. IKE'S CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Ike and Maggie stare forward. Both seem in melancholy moods. <br>
              They're beginning to sense they're in trouble here. Suddenly, <br>
              the car falters and jerks. It shows to a stop on the shoulder of 
              <br>
              the road. The car backfires and smokes.</p>
            <p> EXT. IKE'S CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Ike and Maggie sit in the steaming car for a moment.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Your filter's clogged. This takes <br>
              unleaded.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Can you fix it?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              First I have to find some tools. I <br>
              need a half and a nine-six-tenth.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (removing his glasses)<br>
              Of what?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (in amazement)<br>
              Wrenches. My dad's gonna love that one.</p>
            <p> Maggie slams the food closed.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Kind of isolated.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yeah. It's kind of nice.</p>
            <p> An uncomfortable silent pause. Ike breaks the moment.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              There's one thing we New Yorkers know <br>
              how to do is hail a cab. If there's no <br>
              cab, we walk.</p>
            <p> Ike stares off down the road. Maggie indicates a building in <br>
              the distance, then turns off the car lights.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I can get some tools over there.... and <br>
              save the battery... There's one thing <br>
              we country girls know how to do is cut <br>
              across a field. It's quicker.</p>
            <p> Maggie points diagonally across the field to where a gas station 
              <br>
              sign glows and the lights from the outer house twinkle.</p>
            <p> He smiles and follows her into the field.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Be careful of snakes.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Snakes? Are you serious? I don't like <br>
              snakes. I've never even seen a snake.</p>
            <p> He steps carefully into the field, then hops gingerly toward Maggie.</p>
            <p> MOMENTS LATER</p>
            <p> Maggie leads Ike through a cornfield.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Do you think there's only one right <br>
              person for everybody?</p>
            <p> Ike chooses his words carefully.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No. But I think attraction is too <br>
              often mistaken for rightness. <br>
              Attraction is very misleading. And if <br>
              it's mutual, it's well, terribly <br>
              distracting.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yes it is. And it doesn't mean <br>
              anything.</p>
            <p> Ike nods as they come to a wooden fence. She puts her hand on 
              <br>
              his shoulder. Ike puts his hands around her waits to give her a 
              <br>
              boost over the top. We see the flicker of misunderstanding cross 
              <br>
              Maggie's face at the initial contact. Neither of them moves -- <br>
              forward or back, but the electricity is obvious.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: Ike. His conflicted feelings are apparent. With <br>
              difficulty, Maggie straightens up and they both quickly remove <br>
              their hands.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              (lightly)<br>
              I suddenly forgot how to climb a fence.</p>
            <p> They look at each other for a moment, then:</p>
            <p> MAGGIE AND IKE<br>
              (breaking the <br>
              moment jokingly)<br>
              &quot;Tools&quot;.</p>
            <p> She climbs over the fence on her own and Ike follows. They see 
              <br>
              an old guy, LIONEL, whittling on a porch.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Lionel, can I borrow some tools?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Yeah, we need a half and nine-<br>
              sixteenths.</p>
            <p> LIONEL<br>
              Gonna bust out of another wedding?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You're sure well known around here.</p>
            <p> EXT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S BUILDING - THE NEXT DAY</p>
            <p> Establishing shot.</p>
            <p> INT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S KITCHEN (NYC) - DAY</p>
            <p> INT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> INTERCUT BETWEEN TWO LOCATIONS:</p>
            <p> Ike sits on his bed, on the phone, working and eating his <br>
              breakfast. He's watching Maggie's wedding tape again. Fisher <br>
              is cooking an elaborate breakfast. Ellie rushes around getting <br>
              ready for work. He is on the phone to Ike.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Yes, well, my theory was that she may <br>
              be running because she gets attention... <br>
              Negative attention is attention. <br>
              Like when women whack you on the street <br>
              because of your column, that's negative <br>
              attention.</p>
            <p> IKE (V.O.)<br>
              This is about her negative attention, <br>
              not mine. Did you get the <br>
              reimbursement for the dress yet?</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              No, I'm paying for the dress. Do you <br>
              think she's still gonna run?</p>
            <p> IKE (V.O.)<br>
              I don't know.</p>
            <p> Ellie enters the kitchen, hears the question and shakes her head 
              <br>
              to herself. If only these boys would give it up.</p>
            <p> INT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> He is finding it very hard to gloat. Fisher is annoying him.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Look -- I'll be in there later today. <br>
              I'll come by and tell you all about it.</p>
            <p> FISHER (V.O.)<br>
              You're coming here?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Yeah.</p>
            <p> FISHER (V.O.)<br>
              Then come for dinner.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Okay, we'll order out.</p>
            <p> FISHER (V.O.)<br>
              Order out like a Philistine, when you <br>
              got the Galloping Gourmet here?...</p>
            <p> Ike hangs up and watches more of the George Swilling wedding <br>
              video.</p>
            <p> INT. NEW YORK BAR - DAY</p>
            <p> The bar from the opening scene. GEORGE SWILLING, the same man 
              <br>
              Ike talked to before, is sitting on a stool, nursing his drink. 
              <br>
              He looks better. Ike enters. George looks up and recognizes <br>
              Ike, who takes the bar stool next to him.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Get this man a Kamikaze.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, <br>
              very professional job.</p>
            <p> Ike sits and leans over to George.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (whispers)<br>
              You could have told me you were fiance <br>
              number three.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              And end up in the papers? I've been <br>
              humiliated enough already to last a <br>
              lifetime, thank you. I'm sorry she got <br>
              you canned.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Thanks.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              She's a cacophony of contradictions.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Well, I'm writing another article on <br>
              the cacophony.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? <br>
              Like a moth to a flame.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Guess you'd know about that. You're an <br>
              entomologist, right? How's business?</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              (taking a sip <br>
              of his drink)<br>
              Not bad. I was traveling around <br>
              studying the reproductive and migratory <br>
              patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (sarcastic)<br>
              Neuter a locust, feed the world.</p>
            <p> GORGE<br>
              Not the world. Just Africa and China.</p>
            <p> Ike wipes the smirk off his face. Like Maggie's other men, this 
              <br>
              guy has a worthy accomplishment under his belt.</p>
            <p> GEORGE (cont'd)<br>
              You know Maggie was the only girl I <br>
              ever met who would hold my tarantula. <br>
              On the first date.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              So, tell me, George, why do you think <br>
              she ran?</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Same as you said. What did you call <br>
              her? A &quot;man-eater&quot;, &quot;a devouring death <br>
              goddess.&quot;</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I don't think that's why she ran.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Why do YOU think she ran?</p>
            <p> Ike sips his drink before answering.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I don't know. I'm working on it. I <br>
              was on the wrong track.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              And you defending her?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No. I call it like I see it. I'm a <br>
              journalist. I'm a truth teller.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Unbelievable, she got to you.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Oh, please!</p>
            <p> GORGE<br>
              Join the club.<br>
              (passing him <br>
              his drink)<br>
              Here, you need this more than me.</p>
            <p> George heads out.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (protecting, taking <br>
              his tape recorder <br>
              out of his pocket)<br>
              I'm writing an article, I'm getting <br>
              paid to do this, it's going to be a <br>
              cover story, it's going to be published<br>
              ... The facts will be read someday.</p>
            <p> As George pauses in the doorway, Ike holds up his tape recorder.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              What kind of eggs did she like?</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Poached, just like me.</p>
            <p> George exits.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. NEW YORK STREET/FISHER AND ELLIE'S BUILDING - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike walks down a street toward Ellie and Fisher.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S APARTMENT (NYC) - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Ellie is on the phone as Fisher enters with beer. Ike sits at 
              <br>
              the piano.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              (sarcastically)<br>
              Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese <br>
              takeout. That's New York living.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              ... Just call me when you have it.<br>
              (hangs up, then to Fisher)<br>
              Ike, how is the story coming? Is she a <br>
              man-eater?</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Or a vegetarian?</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Or does she pick &quot;NGB'S&quot; -- &quot;Nice Guys, <br>
              But...&quot; Nice guys, but I'm cheap. <br>
              Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... <br>
              Nice guys, but he just out of prison.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No... They're interesting guys. Each <br>
              one of these guys has something going <br>
              for him. I mean, one's been up Everest. <br>
              Another's become a priest. One's a <br>
              pretty good guitar player. And this <br>
              guy today tried to end world hunger, if <br>
              you can believe that...</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Whoa, Ike. Getting a complex, buddy?</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Fisher, let him talk.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (sits)<br>
              But one of those guys -- not one of <br>
              them -- knew her at all. Each one was <br>
              convinced that she was perfect for them, <br>
              but they didn't see her. And she never <br>
              showed up so they couldn't see her. <br>
              It's a very symbolic thing happening. <br>
              She becomes what she thinks they wanted <br>
              to be.</p>
            <p> Fisher doesn't like the sound of this. He glances at Ellie, who 
              <br>
              is looking very interested.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              (in shock)<br>
              Ike is turning sensitive and I can't <br>
              bear to watch. I'm going to make a <br>
              fresh pot of tea.</p>
            <p> The phone rings as Fisher exits. Ike goes to the piano as Ellie 
              <br>
              picks up the phone.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Yeah... Oh, Jay... Okay... Bye.<br>
              (hangs up, then yells to Fisher)<br>
              Fisher, don't forget the fortune <br>
              cookies.</p>
            <p> She joins Ike at the piano. Ike gets serious.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Is that what I did to you? Is that <br>
              what happened? Did I just not see <br>
              you?</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              No. No, you didn't.</p>
            <p> He hugs her.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (heartfelt)<br>
              Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, <br>
              Ellie.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              I'm sorry, too.<br>
              (beat)<br>
              Wow. That only took us between years <br>
              to say.</p>
            <p> Ellie blinks back sentimental tears.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. TROUT'S BARN - THE NEXT NIGHT</p>
            <p> We hear Hawaiian music. We see a truck with GUESTS drive up and 
              <br>
              HULA DANCERS through barn slats.</p>
            <p> INT. TROUT'S BARN - NIGHT</p>
            <p> It's a small barn that's been converted into a luau with a bar. 
              <br>
              A BAND plays for two hula dancers. The Trouts had decorated it <br>
              as a little slice of Hawaii. There are tiki lights, numerous <br>
              rented plastic palm trees and fiberglass copies of Hawaiian <br>
              statuary. Strings of colored lights crisscross the ceiling. <br>
              It looks like a Hawaiian high school gym on prom night.</p>
            <p> Maggie's family, Mrs. Trout and people we've already met, and 
              <br>
              more, are here, milling around wit tropical drinks garnished <br>
              with umbrellas. Plastic leis abound and most people have <br>
              managed to find their old Hawaiian shirts. </p>
            <p> As we come in, the hula dancers finish their applause and Mrs. 
              <br>
              Trout announces. Hula dancers stop.</p>
            <p> LOU TROUT<br>
              Welcome to our annual country luau. As <br>
              you know, Betty and I got married on <br>
              the rim of the crater, Diamond Head.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              (grabbing the <br>
              microphone)<br>
              This year, we're dedicating our first <br>
              dance to the soon-to-be newlyweds, the <br>
              King and Queen of Hawaii, Maggie and <br>
              Bob.</p>
            <p> The couple enters. Bob is a goody bronzed god in his King <br>
              Kamahamela outfit. Maggie is spectacular in her authentic <br>
              looking Hawaiian Princess get-up. But her face reflects none <br>
              of the festivities around her. Every now and then, she looks up 
              <br>
              and glances around for Ike, hating herself for it.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT (cont'd)<br>
              King and Queen, dance.</p>
            <p> Maggie and Bob start to dance as the Quarter sings &quot;Aloha 
              Oe.&quot;</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT (cont'd)<br>
              Everybody dance.</p>
            <p> Everybody dances.</p>
            <p> TIMES OUT:</p>
            <p> Maggie and Bob pose for pictures with some of the guests.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              Pictures of the King and Queen.</p>
            <p> Dennis poses with Maggie. Cory poses with Bob. Mrs. Trout runs 
              <br>
              out of film and goes to get more, leaving Peggy and Maggie alone. 
              <br>
              Peggy whispers to Maggie.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Lighten up, wahine.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Lighten up, what?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              This party is for you and Bob. Get <br>
              your mind off the reporter.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. <br>
              It just gives me the creeps a little bit. <br>
              I'd feel better if I knew where he was.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (nods to door)<br>
              Would it?</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: Ike just entering the party. At least he tried. <br>
              He's got a tropical sheet wrapped around his pants and shirt. <br>
              He walks to the bar and is greeted warmly by Lee. Maggie gets <br>
              very flustered.</p>
            <p> PEGGY (cont'd)<br>
              What are you doing?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (after a beat)<br>
              I'm going to go dance with Bob. <br>
              Because he's the man.<br>
              (referring to her headdress)<br>
              I like those grapes.</p>
            <p> Maggie dances affectionately with Bob as Mr. Trout, tending <br>
              bar, greets Ike.</p>
            <p> LOU TROUT<br>
              Hey, Mr. Graham, welcome to our luau. <br>
              What can I get you?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You got something without a toy in it?</p>
            <p> TIME CUT:</p>
            <p> A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON</p>
            <p> A pair of expressive pantomime &quot;A Little Grass Shack&quot;.</p>
            <p> PULL BACK TO REVEAL:</p>
            <p> Mrs. Trout is on stage, introducing hula contestants. Grandma 
              <br>
              judges the Hawaiian dancing. The party is at full tilt -- a <br>
              little wild, a little goofy. Some guests (Bob, Cindy, Cory, Lee 
              <br>
              and Ted) do the limbo. Walter, Mrs. Pressman doesn't turn as <br>
              she hears him.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Aloha. That's a very fetching <br>
              headdress you're wearing.</p>
            <p> Ike leans into Maggie, enjoying the smell of her hair. She <br>
              notices, but acts casual.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Where did you disappear to?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Missed me bad, huh?</p>
            <p> TIME CUT:</p>
            <p> All the guests start banding their pineapple cups. Walter rises 
              <br>
              unsteadily, lifting his pineapple.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              Attention. Listen to Walter. Listen <br>
              close, he slurs.<br>
              (then)<br>
              Shut up, wahines!</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              In the tradition that has grown through <br>
              the years, it is now Toast Time! First <br>
              up, our host, &quot;A Honey of a Beekeeper&quot;, <br>
              Lou Trout..</p>
            <p> Lou Trout stands with his glass raised.</p>
            <p> LOUT TROUT<br>
              May the groom's heart be filled with <br>
              hopes and the bride's feet be filled <br>
              with lead!</p>
            <p> There are shouts of &quot;Hear hear!&quot; Walter roars.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              May the pitter-patter of little feet <br>
              not be Maggie's.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              May the gifts be returned!</p>
            <p> TED<br>
              May the back of the dress be as pretty <br>
              as the front!</p>
            <p> The laughter swells and swells, led by Walter.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Ike watches as Maggie takes the heat, raising her glass along 
              <br>
              with the others. Bob raises his glass like the good sport he is. 
              <br>
              Ike can't believe it.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              You know the old saying, &quot;You're not <br>
              losing a daughter...&quot; Well, I'd like to!</p>
            <p> Walter gets a bit laugh. He goes again.</p>
            <p> WALTER (cont'd)<br>
              Maggie may not be Hale's longest <br>
              running joke... <br>
              (under her breath)</p>
            <p> Maggie finishes the punchline along with his father.</p>
            <p> WALTER AND MAGGIE<br>
              -- But she's certainly the fastest.</p>
            <p> Uproarious laughter. Maggie looks terribly pained. Ike's had <br>
              enough. He pushes himself to his feet. Walter is thrilled. He <br>
              shushes the CROWD.</p>
            <p> WALTER (cont'd)<br>
              Oh, look, Mr. Graham, how about a toast?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I don't know, give me a minute. <br>
              (to Maggie)<br>
              Are you all right with this?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Excuse me?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Are you all right with this? You think <br>
              this is funny?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I don't and I don't think you should...</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              It's a joke. They're kidding.</p>
            <p> WALTER AND CROWD<br>
              (yell)<br>
              Come on and give us a toast.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You want me to make a toast? Okay... <br>
              I'll give you a toast. To Maggie's <br>
              family and friends. May you find <br>
              yourselves the bull's eye of an easy <br>
              target. May you be publicly flogged <br>
              for all of your bad choices and may <br>
              your noses to rubbed in all of your <br>
              mistakes...</p>
            <p> Ike watches their reaction. The silence is deafening. All the 
              <br>
              guests stare at Maggie. Mortified, she holds back tears.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              That was funny.<br>
              (a pause)<br>
              But enough toasts, let's hula. Let's <br>
              start the music up.</p>
            <p> She gets everyone up to hula. Band plays fast tune. Maggie <br>
              walks through the CROWD down the steps and outside. Ike <br>
              follows, but Peggy grabs a coat for her. Bob watches her go as <br>
              Cory approaches.</p>
            <p> CORY<br>
              Hey, Bob. I got twenty dollars bet on--</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Not now.</p>
            <p> Bob rushes after Maggie.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (calling after her)<br>
              Maggie. Maggie.<br>
              (to Ike, handing him a jacket)<br>
              Here. She may need this. It's not <br>
              really Hawaii.</p>
            <p> Ike exits. Then, Bob comes over.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Where'd Maggie go?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Oh, she just went to get me something <br>
              from the car.</p>
            <p> Cory comes over with Dennis to Bob and Peggy. BOB/PEGGY/CORY/ 
              <br>
              DENNIS CHUFFA: About Bart Starr and football. (Which keeps Bob <br>
              from going outside to follow Maggie). Bob thinks about it.</p>
            <p> EXT. TROUT'S BARN - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Ike runs after Maggie. He grabs her arm and turns her to him.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I'm the only goddamn person in there <br>
              pulling for you.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You humiliated me!</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No, Maggie, I defended you. <br>
              Humiliating you is what everyone else <br>
              is doing. It's the theme of this party.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I had it under control. Now they feel <br>
              sorry for me.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Well, they should. Because they're <br>
              about to watch you hang yourself again.</p>
            <p> Maggie has no response.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              -- Tell me something, do you really <br>
              care about Mount Everest?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              It's fun! It's high.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Or the sexual habits of locusts?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              That was very interesting research <br>
              George was doing!</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary <br>
              tattoo?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I already explained about that.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              And where you ever really going to run <br>
              the leper colony in Molokai?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (wincing)<br>
              Brian told you that?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Or maybe you just wanted to wear the <br>
              headdress.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Every one of those times I was being <br>
              supportive. Something you won't <br>
              understand.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Supportive? You weren't being <br>
              supportive. You were being scared. <br>
              Just like now. You are the most lost <br>
              woman I have ever laid eyes on.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Lost!</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              That's right. You're so lost you don't <br>
              even know how you like your eggs.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              What!?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              With the priest, you liked them <br>
              scrambled. With the Dead Head, fried. <br>
              With the bug guy, poached. Now it's <br>
              egg whites only, thank you very much.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              That's called changing your mind.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No, that's called not having a mind of <br>
              your own. What are you doing, Maggie? <br>
              You really want to let that man drag <br>
              you up Annapuma on your honeymoon? You <br>
              don't want to climb Annapuma.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yes I do!</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No you don't. You want a man who will <br>
              lead you down the beach with his head <br>
              over your eyes just so you can discover <br>
              the feel of the sand under your feet. <br>
              You want a guy who will take you into a <br>
              cave with a thousand candles just to <br>
              read you a poem. You want a man to <br>
              wake you up at dawn because he's <br>
              burning to talk to you and he can't <br>
              wait another minute to find out what <br>
              you'll say. Am I right?</p>
            <p> He's laid her flat. Maggie can't speak.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              Am I right?</p>
            <p> She fights back angry tears.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Stop. Stop it! I'm getting married on <br>
              Sunday, and you're just trying to make <br>
              me run! Why? Because you're a cynical, <br>
              exploitative, mean-hearted creep who <br>
              wouldn't know real love if it bit him <br>
              in the armpit! And all you do is tear <br>
              other people down and-and-and laugh at <br>
              them, and criticize what they do, <br>
              because you're too afraid to do <br>
              anything yourself! I read your column. <br>
              You never wrote one about you. I'm not <br>
              the only one who's lost and you know it! <br>
              Am I right? Well? Am I right?</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: Bob comes outside.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Mag. Help me out here. Green Bay. <br>
              Right guard.</p>
            <p> Both Maggie and Ike are breathing hard. Bob comes up to Maggie 
              <br>
              and gives Ike a very hard look as he puts his arm around his <br>
              fiancee.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              You know... Blocked Bart Starr, crewcut<br>
              ... Are you okay?</p>
            <p> Maggie adjusts her face as best she can.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Let me take you back inside, okay?</p>
            <p> She lets him lead her away.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Jerry Kramer.</p>
            <p> Ike looks at her drooped shoulder and he shakes his head and <br>
              walks to his car.</p>
            <p> EXT. HALE METHODIST CHURCH - THE NEXT DAY</p>
            <p> Peggy and Cindy arrive for the rehearsal. They leave Cindy's <br>
              dog in Peggy's car and walk to the church.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              Tell me, why does Maggie need another <br>
              wedding rehearsal and two days before <br>
              the wedding? She's already done this.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Bob is making her visualize the <br>
              ceremony.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. HALE METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT</p>
            <p> They are in the church proper now. Peggy waits in a pew as Bob 
              <br>
              leads Maggie and Ike up the back steps of the church.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              (to Maggie)<br>
              Okay, we're ready. Want me to have Ike <br>
              leave now?</p>
            <p> Maggie turns on Ike with &quot;cheerful&quot; hostility.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No. No -- Actually, let's make Ike the <br>
              pastor.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I'd rather not.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (sarcastically)<br>
              Come on, it'll give you a great view. <br>
              It's perfect.<br>
              (seeing Peggy) <br>
              Hey.</p>
            <p> Maggie smiles at Bob. Ike sighs and goes with it. Bob pulls Ike 
              <br>
              to the head of the aisle and places him. Peggy follows Maggie <br>
              into the foyer to get ready. Cindy sits with Ted at the organ.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Team effort, Pastor Ike... Cindy, ready? <br>
              (after no response)<br>
              Cindy, come on.</p>
            <p> Cindy leaves to join the girls in the foyer.</p>
            <p> INT. CHURCH FOYER - THAT MOMENT</p>
            <p> Once in the privacy of the foyer, Peggy and Maggie talk.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              He's going to be the pastor?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yep. I want him to be front and center <br>
              and to watch everything.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              What happened at the luau?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (flustered)<br>
              ... I don't even want to talk about <br>
              the luau.<br>
              (then seeing a hanging rope)<br>
              What's this?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              It's for the bell.</p>
            <p> Cindy joins them.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              Bob's in a hurry.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Don't be nervous, Maggie. Let us <br>
              visualize. Remember what Bob said? <br>
              &quot;Be the ball.&quot;</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              &quot;Sink the putt.&quot;</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              &quot;Make the shot.&quot;</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              &quot;Nothing but net.&quot;</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              &quot;Never say die.&quot;</p>
            <p> Maggie puts her hands up.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Go!</p>
            <p> Peggy and Cindy exit. Maggie pulls the bell rope and sways back 
              <br>
              and forth as she rings the bell.</p>
            <p> INT. CHAPEL - THAT MOMENT</p>
            <p> It is Maggie's turn to enter. They all turn expectantly. Too <br>
              much time passes. Ted plays the organ, then stops. Maggie <br>
              swings back and forth in the foyer doorway.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Honey, are you okay?</p>
            <p> Maggie stops ringing the bell and pulls herself together. She 
              <br>
              walks into the aisle looking a little shaky. She takes a few <br>
              tremulous steps slowly with her eyes closed, peeking <br>
              occasionally with one eye.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (taking off his jacket)<br>
              At this pace, it could be an evening <br>
              wedding.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Hold it! Hold it! I think we're <br>
              taking this too fast.</p>
            <p> He begins to pace.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              We need to limber you up a little. <br>
              You're tensing.<br>
              (thinks a moment; <br>
              to Ike, moving him <br>
              to groom's spot)<br>
              You stand here and be me so she knows <br>
              how far she'll have to go.<br>
              (then to Maggie)<br>
              I'm going to walk with you.</p>
            <p> Bob goes to Maggie and walks behind her.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              Visualize! Visualize! It's game time.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Maggie walking.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              You are the football. You're spiraling <br>
              through the air towards the hands of <br>
              the groom.</p>
            <p> She proceeds down the aisle. Bob behind her.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (eyes down)<br>
              Yes, I'm spiraling through the air.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Maggie raises her eyes and sees Ike in front of her as groom. 
              <br>
              Ike and Maggie lock gazes. If they had to, they couldn't look <br>
              away. All the things unspoken are now communicated -- the love, 
              <br>
              the longing.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              I streak towards the goal line.</p>
            <p> Maggie's pace quickens.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              And I land on the goal line.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Bob beams to see Maggie's eager arrival at Ike's side. He <br>
              switches off the music and proceeds like a proud coach to be the 
              <br>
              pastor.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Okay, I'm the pastor. Dearly beloved, <br>
              blah, blah, blah. So on and so forth. <br>
              Ra ta ta ta. Yabada dabada. I now <br>
              pronounce you man and wife. Kiss the <br>
              bride, badum dum.<br>
              (then moving toward Ted)<br>
              We have the crescendo that leads to us <br>
              right back down the aisle and out the...</p>
            <p> Ike kisses Maggie. It is a world class, Olympic kiss. It is a 
              <br>
              kiss that changes everything and can never be taken back. It is 
              <br>
              a kiss you only get once in your life.</p>
            <p> NEW ANGLE:</p>
            <p> Bob's smile dies. Cindy's mouth drops open as the kiss goes on 
              <br>
              and on. Peggy loses control and screams.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              Maggie!!!!?</p>
            <p> Like a bucket of water thrown on two dogs, Ike and Maggie are 
              <br>
              startled out of their kiss. They pull apart and smile at each <br>
              other.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: Bob.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              (furious)<br>
              If you were imagining me, you did great.<br>
              (to Ike)<br>
              What the hell were you doing?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (eyes on Maggie)<br>
              I'm sorry, Bob. She kissed me back.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (dazed but happy)<br>
              I kissed him back.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Yeah, I caught that. Want to tell me <br>
              how long this has been going on?</p>
            <p> Maggie looks at Ike, wondrous, confused.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              About a minute...?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              A little longer for me.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Really?</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              What do you expect me to say to this?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              How about -- &quot;I hope you'll be very <br>
              happy together&quot;?</p>
            <p> Bob hauls back and punches Ike in the face. Ike drops.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              I hope you'll be very happy together.</p>
            <p> Bob storms down the aisle and out of the church.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (to Peggy)<br>
              Take care of him.</p>
            <p> Maggie leaves.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. CHURCH - THAT MOMENT</p>
            <p> Bob is halfway down the walk. Maggie appears at the church door 
              <br>
              and calls after him.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Bob, I'm sorry!<br>
              (half to herself)<br>
              At least I backed out before the <br>
              wedding. That's progress!</p>
            <p> He keeps marching. Now Peggy appears next to Maggie. Maggie <br>
              calls again.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Some woman is going to make you a lot <br>
              happier than I ever could...</p>
            <p> The words are barely out of her mouth when Cindy comes out the 
              <br>
              door, racing after Bob at a full sprint.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              See?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Well, Maggie -- in the words of Mrs. <br>
              Pressman: &quot;Holy moly&quot;. Call me later.</p>
            <p> Peggy goes to her car. Cindy joins her as Bob speeds off in his 
              <br>
              car. Now Ike takes Peggy's place next to Maggie. Maggie turns <br>
              to face Ike. They are both beet red, stammering and unable to <br>
              look at each other, trying to act normal.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Okay. So... what, uh... What just <br>
              happened? Just now? Jus then? In <br>
              there?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I don't know. I, uh -- I frankly don't <br>
              even want to talk about it.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Me, either.</p>
            <p> Ike GRABS Maggie and BOOM -- they are all over each other, <br>
              kissing frantically, tongues, hands, hair, elbow, you name it. <br>
              Blathering fools.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (blathering)<br>
              I love you. I love you.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (blathering)<br>
              I love you, too.</p>
            <p> They come up for air.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Wait. We have to talk. We have to do <br>
              some talking now. Pull up a railing.</p>
            <p> Maggie sits on the railing, then Ike backs up and sits on the 
              <br>
              opposite railing.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              You have to go down an aisle and say &quot;I <br>
              do&quot;. You have to get married.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              To who? Are you asking me?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Me?</p>
            <p> Ike backs up to opposite railing and sits facing Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yes, you!</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (thinks)<br>
              Well, you do have the dress.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              And the church.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              And the wedding date. There's the two <br>
              of us.<br>
              (beat)<br>
              So, you think... maybe... You have to <br>
              go down the aisle with somebody you <br>
              love and who love you back.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'm okay with that.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              So am I.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              So, we'll...</p>
            <p> They both nod and sit there smiling, sort of. The organist, Ted, 
              <br>
              closes the church door.</p>
            <p> TED<br>
              Good night.</p>
            <p> Ike pulls his tape recorder out of his pocket and quietly speaks 
              <br>
              into it.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I'm getting married.</p>
            <p> WIDE SHOT:</p>
            <p> They smile at each other and remain sitting. Then, silence.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. STREET/HALE/ATLANTIC HOTEL - THAT NIGHT</p>
            <p> Ike drives up and parks in front of the hotel as he talks on his 
              <br>
              cell phone.</p>
            <p> INTERCUT WITH:</p>

            <p> Ellie's on the phone. Fisher sits nearby.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Ike's going to get married.</p>
            <p> Fisher throws himself onto the carpet and rolls himself <br>
              helpless with laughter.</p>
            <p> ELLIE (cont'd)<br>
              (without turning to him)<br>
              Fisher, if you pee on that Persian, <br>
              I'll kill you.</p>

            <p> INT. BEAUTY SALON - NIGHT DAY</p>
            <p> Maggie talks to Peggy, Cindy and Grandma Julia. Grandma Julia 
              <br>
              sits under a hair dryer. Sprout, the dog, sits in his basket.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              I love his eyes. I just believe <br>
              they're listening to you.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              His hair... any color.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              I like his tight butt.</p>
            <p> Peggy laughs.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Grandma!</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (to Cindy)<br>
              See, this is a mature relationship. <br>
              She's really found it.</p>

            <p> Maggie and Ike horseback riding. They sit on their horses <br>
              amongst trees, &quot;nuzzling&quot;. Ike reads as he pushes Maggie

              tire swing.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike and Maggie open and close a Hoberman ball by holding its <br>

            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> There is a fire in the fireplace. Maggie and Ike sit as Ike <br>
              shows Maggie some passages from his favorite books. He's <br>
              reading something from Yeats at the moment. They seem happy.</p>

            <p> It is a media circus including FOUR REPORTERS, Midday with <br>

              reporters are interviewing, a GERMAN LADY, BUTCH KENAN, a <br>

              We'll come back on the air when the <br>
              results are in. Back to you, Jessica.</p>
            <p> Meredith, the low-end public access TV reporter, films himself

              pointing a cheap video camera himself.</p>
            <p> MEREDITH<br>
              The turnout for this morning's wedding <br>
              is usually reserved for royalty or <br>
              Hollywood stars, but Maggie Carpenter <br>
              is Hale, Maryland's special star and <br>
              the citizens of Hale are out in full <br>
              force today.</p>

              The bride's been here for almost an <br>
              hour, but being around in the beginning <br>
              was never her problem. We'll be here, <br>
              showing you the full wedding ceremony, <br>
              we hope.</p>
            <p> Reporter JACKI and TIFFANY stand at the edge of the CROWD <br>

            <p> JACKI/REPORTER #3 (WBOC TV16)<br>
              Will she or won't she? That is on the <br>
              minds of these several hundreds folks, <br>
              who are standing here this morning. <br>
              Not to mention on the mind of Groom <br>
              Number #4, ex-USA Today columnist, Ike <br>
              Graham, who is missing in action.</p>
            <p> EXT. WINDOW OF CHURCH/INT. SUNDAY SCHOOL ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> INSERT window of church. Peggy peers out the window at the <br>
              carnival scene. Cindy sits with Maggie as she leans forward, <br>
              doubled over on a child's chair. Peggy moves from the window to 
              <br>
              sit with them.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (moves to window)<br>
              He's not coming. Watch. He's not <br>
              coming.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              No, no. I saw eight geese flying in a <br>
              &quot;V&quot;.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You and your lucky geese. You always <br>
              see geese.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Not eight...</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              And in a &quot;V&quot;.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Eight is good... &quot;V&quot; could be Victory.</p>
            <p> They ad lib various words starting with the letter &quot;V&quot;. 
              Maggie <br>
              is nervous.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              Rub your ears.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. <br>
              Cory does that to me when I <br>
              hyperventilate.</p>
            <p> Maggie rubs her ears.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              We do it to our dog.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              It's hurting.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              We'll rub.</p>
            <p> After they rub Maggie's ears a bit:</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              He's here! He's here!</p>
            <p> They all squeeze and peer out window. They scream in excitement. 
              <br>
              Cindy rushes to Maggie's wedding dress.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              I'll get the dress.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              He's here!... He's here!</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Now's the time for calm... If you don't <br>
              calm down, you won't get your dress on...<br>
              (reassuringly)<br>
              He's the one... He's the one.</p>
            <p> Peggy moves to help Cindy with the dress. Maggie stands alone 
              at <br>
              the window a moment. She picks up a toy horse.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              This is not a good sign.</p>
            <p> Maggie goes over to Peggy and Cindy, and starts to get into her 
              <br>
              bridal gown. They continue to ad lib words standing with the <br>
              letter &quot;V&quot;.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              We have to hurry. The Sunday School <br>
              kids will be here soon.</p>

            <p> INT. IKE'S CAR - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike pulls up slowly. GUESTS peer through the his car window and 
              <br>
              wave. Ike rubs his headache.</p>
            <p> JULIE MURPHY<br>
              Well, the groom just pulled up. There <br>
              was talk of a &quot;now show&quot;, but he is <br>
              here.</p>
            <p> DINA NAPOLI<br>

              <br>
              on a neighbor's lawn, invited GUESTS flock by in their party <br>
              best, and local NEWS TEAMS block the way. The STATE SENATOR is <br>
              making a speech welcoming the press to Maryland. A large GROUP <br>
              of reporters head up the church's stairs, hauling their <br>
              equipment. They enter the flood of PEOPLE streaming inside the <br>
              church. Ike snaps.</p>
            <p> EXT. IKE'S CAR - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> Ike stops the car where it is and jumps out, slamming the door 
              in <br>
              anger. The REPORTERS swarm around him as he gets out of the car. 
              <br>
              They continue to pound him with questions as he walks to church 
              <br>
              steps. An OLDER LADY smacks him on the shoulder with a <br>
              newspaper. He turns in astonishment and continues up the <br>
              steps. He charges up the stairs and grabs Lee.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Shoot ours so she has one with an <br>
              ending.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Pressman stands, shooting Ike with her video camera.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              (pleading)<br>
              Mrs. Pressman, please.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              It's okay. There's no microphone. <br>
              You're no fun.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No, I'm not.</p>
            <p> Ike retreats into the church. Lee comes up to him again with his 
              <br>
              video camera: CHUFFA about Scorsese.</p>
            <p> INT. CHURCH - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> As Fisher and Ellie sign the guest book, a LOCAL LADY stares at 
              <br>
              Ellie. Ellie stares back at her until she leaves. Ike walks <br>
              away from Lee and turns smack into Ellie and Fisher. Ike puts <br>
              his arms around them and gives them a big hug.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Friends. Thank you. Thank you.</p>
            <p> Over Ellie's shoulder, Ike sees Fisher's grinning face.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              We are friends, aren't we, Fisher?</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              (grinning)<br>
              Of course we are. Of course.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Then you'll be my best man.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm <br>
              best.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell <br>
              you what to do. And someone will tell <br>
              me what to do.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              You always looked great in that suit... <br>
              And Ike? <br>
              (emotional)<br>
              I'm happy for you, honey.</p>
            <p> Ellie whispers in his ear.</p>
            <p> ELLIE (cont'd)<br>
              I'll have a car around the back to <br>
              whisk you out of here if she runs.</p>
            <p> Ellie kisses him on the cheek and walks away.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Bob comes up to Ike. He looks like he's going to punch Ike, then 
              <br>
              abruptly holds out a rose boutonniere.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              You look awful.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (sarcastically)<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> Bob hands the flower to Ike. Ike is shaking. Bob catches this 
              <br>
              and looks up to Ike. It is a moment of clean honesty between the 
              <br>
              men.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Ike. Need help?</p>
            <p> He takes the boutonniere and puts it on Ike's lapel.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              I'm glad it's you.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Really?</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              I didn't want to find out I wasn't for <br>
              her in the fourth quarter.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Got any last minute advice?</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              (motioning to their eyes)<br>
              Maintain eye contact.</p>
            <p> Bob turns and leaves, going down a side staircase.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (to himself)<br>
              Eye contact. Eye contact.</p>
            <p> Out of the corner of his eye, Ike sees a pictures of Christ on 
              the <br>
              wall. He leans into the picture and whispers.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              Cover me.</p>
            <p> He walks into the chapel.</p>
            <p> INT. CHAPEL - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> Ike steps up and stands next to Fisher.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              (to Ike)<br>
              I have no idea what I'm doing.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Your job is... the ring.<br>
              (to Fisher)<br>
              Do you have the ring?!</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              I just found out I'm best man! I'm <br>
              lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?</p>
            <p> Ike gives the ring to Fisher. The Pastor approaches Ike. Ike <br>
              turns away and look out over the guests. </p>
            <p> IKE'SPOV: There are most of the TOWNSPEOPLE we've come to <br>
              know, plus some NEW YORKERS for Ike, with little ponytails. <br>
              Armani wire rims, Donna Karan bodysuits. There's a lot of <br>
              smirking, checking out the hicks, forming their stories for <br>
              cocktail hour. Elaine is in back all dressed in black, mourning 
              <br>
              Ike. Mrs. Trout approaches Ike.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              You should thank Lou and I for the <br>
              wedding car -- a '63 Buick.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              Oh, come on. You're practically family.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Trout starts picking lint off Fisher's jacket.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Hello. I'm Fisher.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              This doesn't want to come out.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              You just pull a hair from my neck.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Mrs. Trout, go back to your seat!</p>
            <p> INT. CHURCH FOYER - DAY</p>
            <p> Peggy joins Maggie, who is blowing bubblegum and swaying in <br>
              front of an oscillating fan. Grandma and Walter come in. <br>
              Grandma gives her a kiss on the cheek.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              Good luck, Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Thank you, Grandma.</p>
            <p> Grandma leaves. Walter steps up.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              (quietly to Maggie)<br>
              I'm really rooting for this one.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Thank you, Dad.</p>
            <p> Peggy turns off the fan. Cindy takes the bag from Maggie.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              Spit.</p>
            <p> Maggie spits her bubblegum into the bag. Peggy hands Maggie her 
              <br>
              bouquet.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Let's go.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No sauntering down the aisle. Just <br>
              make time. Let's just get there.</p>
            <p> Cindy and Peggy nod and leave. The door closes.</p>
            <p> INT. CHAPEL - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> Both extends his hand to Elaine.</p>
            <p> ELAINE<br>
              Hi, I'm Elaine from New York.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Hello. I'm Bob, Maggie's fourth <br>
              attempt.</p>
            <p> ELAINE<br>
              I'm sorry.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              That's okay. There's a lid for every <br>
              pot. Besides, I'm comfortable with Ike. <br>
              I mean, Jack Dempsey lost his <br>
              heavyweight title to a New Yorker.</p>
            <p> ELAINE<br>
              I know. Gene Tunney.</p>
            <p> The organ begins to play. The organist is Ted. Grandma, Walter, 
              <br>
              Mrs. Pressman and the Trouts watch. Mrs. Trout picks lint off of 
              <br>
              her husband's jacket.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Cindy and Peggy enter with the confident air of people who have 
              <br>
              done this before. They make it to the head of the aisle all too 
              <br>
              quickly. Peggy gives Ike a wink and an encouraging smile.</p>
            <p> INT. CHURCH FOYER - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> The door opens and Dennis sticks his head in.</p>
            <p> DENNIS<br>
              They're ready, Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Just a second.</p>
            <p> Dennis closes the door behind him as he goes back into the <br>
              chapel. Maggie has a moment alone. She looks at back door as <br>
              possible escape route, then changes her mind. She signals the <br>
              start of the wedding by knocking on the door.</p>
            <p> INT. CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> Immediately, Cory and Dennis open the doors for her entrance. 
              <br>
              All the guests stand as Maggie enter the chapel smiling.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE'S POV:</p>
            <p> The aisle stretches before her into infinity. Faces goggle at 
              <br>
              her from every direction. The tiny figure of Ike stands like a <br>
              beacon a long way off.</p>
            <p> NEW ANGLE:</p>
            <p> She plunges forward with a sped-up hesitation step.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Ike rocks imperceptibly, urging her on. Peggy and Cindy make <br>
              little &quot;come on&quot; motions. It seems to be working. Maggie 
              <br>
              approaches rapidly. The CROWD has turned from skepticism to <br>
              looks and noises of encouragement.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: MAGGIE</p>
            <p> But then her feet gradually begin to slow.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Fisher gives a little &quot;darn, so close&quot; look.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> But Ike is too busy maintaining eye contact. His eyes urge <br>
              Maggie closer -- loving her, willing her on.</p>
            <p> CLOSE ON:</p>
            <p> Maggie stops her walk, gives Ike a teasing smile, and then <br>
              resumes with her walk toward him. His face. Her face. His <br>
              face. Her face.</p>
            <p> CLOSE ON:</p>
            <p> Her foot inches forward. The other follows.</p>
            <p> NEW ANGLE:</p>
            <p> A sigh now rises from the GUESTS as Maggie closes in on Ike. He 
              <br>
              smiles at her. She smiles at him. She is almost there... She's <br>
              there, smiling at Ike. The Pastor gestures to the guests to sit 
              <br>
              down. They do.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Ike sneezes. She looks down and imagines she sees the carpet <br>
              splitting apart. And she bolts like a bat out of hell! In a <br>
              flurry of white, she is halfway down the aisle before Ike knows 
              <br>
              what hits him.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Ike stands there dazed. For a second. Then she springs into <br>
              action, charging after her.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (yelling out)<br>
              Block the doors!</p>
            <p> Like a general, he points to Dennis and Cory in the back and <br>
              sends them into action. The doors shut in Maggie's face. But <br>
              she's a wild animal cornered. She moves to the side. The <br>
              TOWNSPEOPLE stand so Ike can hurry through the pew. Ike climbs <br>
              on the pews towards her as GUEST crowd the aisle, blocking his <br>
              path. Like a gazelle, she leaps to the side aisle and scampers <br>
              down and away. Fisher gets on his cell phone. Ike charges from <br>
              one of the full pews, crosses the aisle and leaps across the pews 
              <br>
              near the staircase to cut her off. He grabs her veil and it <br>
              comes off in his hands. Maggie disappears down the steps of the 
              <br>
              church basement. Ike fumble with the veil and jumps over the <br>
              railing, landing on Dennis' toe. He follows down the stairs <br>
              after her. Mrs. Pressman and Walter exchange bet money.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> Maggie comes down steps and enters the church children's Sunday 
              <br>
              school class. A lot of KIDS And TEACHERS are doing religious <br>
              arts and crafts. As Maggie runs through:</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              There's a man coming down those steps <br>
              with lots of candy in his pockets. If <br>
              you tickle him, he'll give candy.</p>
            <p> She gives her bouquet to a little GIRL as she goes by. Ike comes 
              <br>
              down stairs.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Maggie!</p>
            <p> The KIDS mob him, grabbing his pockets. Ike fights his way <br>
              through KIDS.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Maggie as she's in the church kitchen and hops on counter and 
              <br>
              heads out the window. The window is wide enough.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Ike as he gets to the window, but Maggie is out in driveway.</p>
            <p> EXT. CHURCH DRIVEWAY - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> Maggie flies toward a FedEx truck at next house just leaving.</p>
            <p> ANOTHER ANGLE:</p>
            <p> She gathers her dress and jumps in as Ike yells from window, <br>
              then, quickly climbs out onto the lawn as the truck starts to <br>
              pull away.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Maggie!</p>
            <p> Maggie looks back once, tearful and regretful, and disappears 
              <br>
              inside the truck. The truck races off.</p>
            <p> The PHOTOGRAPHERS turn their cameras on Ike, en masse. He is <br>
              enveloped by a barrage of bright lights.</p>
            <p> Ellie and Fisher, who have also stepped outside on chapel front 
              <br>
              steps, are looking around as Ike turns around the corner and <br>
              past the church.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Look, he's running after her.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Look, he's in pretty good shape.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Poor Ike.</p>
            <p> They look after the FedEx truck and watch Ike chasing the truck 
              <br>
              down the road away from the church.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (running; yells)<br>
              Maggie!</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Where do you think she's going?</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Wherever it is, she'll be there by ten-<br>
              thirty tomorrow.</p>
            <p> Cindy, Cory, Peggy and Meredith also rush out of the church and 
              <br>
              comment on Maggie's runaway. Further down the road, Ike still <br>
              chases the truck, yelling:</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Maggie!</p>
            <p> As the truck rounds the bend in the road and disappears, Ike <br>
              stops and stares alone after the disappearing truck. A swarm of 
              <br>
              REPORTERS catch up to him, flashing pictures and asking <br>
              questions. Another camera flashes and we cut to:</p>

              Quick. Very quick.</p>
            <p> Peggy exits. Maggie stares, losing herself in thought. Then a 
              <br>
              VOICE startles her.</p>
            <p> VOICE<br>
              (whispers)<br>
              Marry me, Maggie.</p>
            <p> Maggie jumps and turns to see: DENNIS -- the kid from the high 
              <br>
              school football team, popping up from a low position near the <br>
              counter.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (softly)<br>
              Hi, Dennis.</p>
            <p> DENNIS<br>
              I am going to propose, you know. I <br>
              mean, the right way. Soon as I turn <br>
              eighteen.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You're sweet, Dennis. But you've got <br>
              to go. I'm closing up. Here's a candy <br>
              bar and one for your brother.</p>
            <p> Dennis takes the candy and starts to go.</p>
            <p> DENNIS<br>
              I'm not giving up. A person shouldn't <br>
              give up.</p>
            <p> Dennis exits. Maggie is alone. She turns out the lamp she <br>
              designed, then on again. She turns off the other lamp on the <br>
              counter and exits. We hold on Maggie's designed lamp.</p>

            <p> Ike walks up to his door, carrying his mail and a bag of <br>
              carryout. He opens the door and walks into his apartment. He <br>
              pets Italics, who sits on his sofa bed. Without taking off his <br>
              coat, he goes to his keyboard and plays music as he CHUFFAS to <br>

            <p> WALTER<br>
              That's Maggie. Home for lunch.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              She's been doing this since the last <br>
              wedding. I don't think it's good.</p>
            <p> Maggie walks in and kisses Grandma on the cheek.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Hey. Grandma, what's for lunch?</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              Turkey and cheese.</p>

              Honey, your grandmother and I were <br>
              thinking about opening a wedding gift <br>

            <p> Walter laughs.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              STOP!</p>
            <p> Walter looks at his daughter in surprise. He's never heard a <br>
              tone like this in her voice before.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (quiet fury)<br>
              Just stop it. Don't say another word <br>

              No. It's my life.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              A harmless joke.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No, it's humiliating and you've been <br>
              doing it since I was a kid. I don't <br>
              like it. Stop. You may not like <br>
              having a daughter with problems. But <br>
              guess what? I don't like having a <br>
              father who's drunk all the time. I'll <br>
              eat in my room.</p>
            <p> Maggie takes a plate and exits.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              That needed to be said. You know -- <br>
              you're always making jokes about her, <br>
              so they won't make jokes about your <br>
              drinking.</p>

            <p> IKE<br>
              Don't tell me. My doorman is one of <br>
              your many admires... I knew I should <br>
              have given him a better Christmas gift.</p>
            <p> Maggie smiles tenuously. She's more than a little terrified.</p>

              I've been making friends with your cat.<br>

              now, do I? But I can't speak for <br>
              Italics.<br>

              Traitor!</p>

              I don't blame you for being mad...</p>
            <p> Ike looks at her. Apparently the word &quot;mad&quot; is an understatement.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              ... Or... furious.</p>
            <p> Ike looks at her again.</p>

              ... Irate? Livid? How's that?</p>
            <p> He starts putting cat food in a bowl. The cat leaves Maggie's 
              <br>
              side and starts to east.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Livid is good. So what is it, Maggie? <br>
              You here on business? I saw your lamps. <br>
              They're terrific.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              It's something I've always wanted to do.</p>
            <p> Ike leaves the kitchen, turns on the balcony lights and re-enters 
              <br>
              the living room from the balcony.</p>

              So, what are you doing here?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I wanted to talk to you about why I run <br>
              or ride away from things.</p>
            <p> Ike moves away from her and sits on the steps near the balcony

            <p> IKE<br>
              (after sitting)<br>
              Does it matter?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I think so... When I was walking down <br>
              the aisle? I was walking toward <br>
              somebody who didn't have any idea who I <br>
              really was. And it was only half the <br>
              other person's fault, because I had <br>
              done everything to convince him that I <br>
              was exactly what he wanted. So it was <br>
              good that I didn't go through with it <br>
              because it would have been a lie, but <br>
              you -- you knew the real me.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Yes, I did.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I didn't. And you being the one at the <br>
              end of the aisle didn't just fix that.</p>
            <p> Ike takes this in. She's reaching him -- but then the defenses 
              <br>
              go back up. He turns to her.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No, I couldn't fix anything...<br>
              (as he gets up)<br>
              But I still ended up chasing a truck.</p>
            <p> Ike moves out to the balcony. After a moment, Maggie follows him.</p>
            <p> EXT. BALCONY/IKE'SAPARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The balcony overlooks Central Park. The twinkling lights of the 
              <br>
              city stretch out across the beautiful night. Ike looks out at <br>
              the view with his back to Maggie as she speaks.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I understand why you bring up the truck. <br>
              Let me explain something. The fact is, <br>
              you've seen me at my worst, most <br>
              embarrassing, deviously plotting, <br>
              potentially but not certifiably, <br>
              psychotic state. And if you liked me <br>
              then, I mean, now... I can't imagine...<br>
              (crosses to him)<br>
              Benedict.</p>
            <p> Ike has no response.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              I love eggs Benedict. I hate all the <br>
              other kinds.</p>
            <p> She hesitates.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              ... I hate big weddings with everybody <br>
              staring. I would like to get married <br>
              on a weekday while everybody is at work. <br>
              If I ride off into the sunset, I want <br>
              my own horse.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Should I be writing this down?</p>
            <p> She returns to the balcony and hands him the box.</p>

              What's this?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>

              They're mine. I'm turning in my <br>
              running shoes to you.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              This is getting serious.</p>
            <p> Now she is glowing at him, shining with the full force of her.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              And one more thing. I know it's hard <br>
              to believe there could be more. Um...</p>
            <p> Maggie glances around and spots a DECK CHAIR, which she turns 
              so <br>
              it is facing the city lights. Then she softly says:</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              If you could have a seat, please.</p>
            <p> Ike sits. Maggie takes the box from him and puts it aide. And 
              <br>
              then she gets down on one knee.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (laughing)<br>
              Oh my God. No.</p>
            <p> Maggie smiles up at him. Ike tips his head back and covers his 
              <br>
              eyes with his hand.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No, no -- don't hide your face, this <br>
              only happens once in a lifetime. It's <br>
              definitely a first to me, and you're <br>
              not going to want to miss it.</p>
            <p> He smiles as he looks at Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              I love you, Homer Eisenhower Graham. <br>
              Will you marry me?</p>
            <p> Ike swallows, overwhelmed, overjoyed, and scared shitless.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Maggie, I gotta think about this a <br>
              little bit.</p>
            <p> Maggie hops cheerfully back to her feet.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (cheerful)<br>
              Good.</p>
            <p> She gets off her knees and stands.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              I was hoping you'd say that.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (laughing)<br>
              You were not.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I was, because if you said &quot;yes&quot; right <br>
              away, I wouldn't get to say this next <br>
              part. And I've been practicing it.<br>
              (pulling up a chair <br>
              and sitting)<br>
              Ready?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I'm listening.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (tenderly)<br>
              &quot;I guarantee that we'll have tough <br>
              times. I guarantee that at some point <br>
              one or both oof us will want to get out. <br>
              But I also guarantee that if I don't <br>
              ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for <br>
              the rest of my life. Because I know in <br>
              my heart -- you're the only one for me&quot;.</p>
            <p> Ike takes her hands affectionately.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Pretty good speech, Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I borrowed it from this guy I know. <br>
              So?</p>
            <p> Ike looks into Maggie's shining face and pauses. He gets up and 
              <br>
              motions with his hand for her to stay seated. He goes inside and 
              <br>
              turns on some music. The cat is sitting by the radio. He <br>
              returns to the balcony and takes Maggie's hand.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Dance with me.</p>
            <p> They start to dance a slow dance.</p>
            <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. LARGE GREEN FIELD - DAY</p>
            <p> We see a hill and on top of it is a Pastor marrying Maggie and 
              <br>
              Ike, in beautiful wedding attire. We see Maggie walk down a <br>
              leaf-lined aisle to a waiting Ike. They kiss as we hear the vows 
              <br>
              and hear them each say &quot;I do&quot;. They kiss a twirling, whirling 
              <br>
              kiss, a circular kiss. We hear the applause of about twenty <br>
              people. Slowly, we see the twenty people come over the crest of 
              <br>
              the hill. They are all Maggie's family and friends, plus the <br>
              old grooms. They are all paired in twos, like a love Noah's ark. 
              <br>
              We see others get the news.</p>
            <p> INT. CHURCH - DAY</p>
            <p> Priest Brian hears about Maggie's wedding.</p>
            <p> INT. BAKERY - DAY</p>
            <p> Mrs. Trout hears about Maggie's wedding.</p>
            <p> INT. NEW YORK BAR - DAY</p>
            <p> George, Groom #3, hears about Maggie's wedding.</p>
            <p> INT. ELLIE'S OFFICE OR APARTMENT - DAY</p>
            <p> Ellie and Fisher hear about Maggie's wedding.</p>
            <p> EXT. FIELD - DAY</p>
            <p> ANOTHER ANGLE:</p>
            <p> Maggie and Ike finally break the kiss. Ike takes her hand and 
              <br>
              walks her to two horses. Ike and Maggie, on the two horses, ride 
              <br>
              off happily in their wedding clothes. As the group cheers, <br>
              Maggie throws bouquet. We see it float in the air.</p>
            <p> FADE TO BLACK.</p>
            <p> THE END</p>

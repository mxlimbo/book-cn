            <p>EXT. HALE METHODIST CHURCH - THE NEXT DAY</p>
            <p> Peggy and Cindy arrive for the rehearsal. They leave Cindy's <br>
              dog in Peggy's car and walk to the church.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              Tell me, why does Maggie need another <br>
              wedding rehearsal and two days before <br>
              the wedding? She's already done this.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Bob is making her visualize the <br>
              ceremony.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. HALE METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT</p>
            <p> They are in the church proper now. Peggy waits in a pew as Bob 
              <br>
              leads Maggie and Ike up the back steps of the church.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              (to Maggie)<br>
              Okay, we're ready. Want me to have Ike <br>
              leave now?</p>
            <p> Maggie turns on Ike with &quot;cheerful&quot; hostility.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No. No -- Actually, let's make Ike the <br>
              pastor.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I'd rather not.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (sarcastically)<br>
              Come on, it'll give you a great view. <br>
              It's perfect.<br>
              (seeing Peggy) <br>
              Hey.</p>
            <p> Maggie smiles at Bob. Ike sighs and goes with it. Bob pulls Ike 
              <br>
              to the head of the aisle and places him. Peggy follows Maggie <br>
              into the foyer to get ready. Cindy sits with Ted at the organ.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Team effort, Pastor Ike... Cindy, ready? <br>
              (after no response)<br>
              Cindy, come on.</p>
            <p> Cindy leaves to join the girls in the foyer.</p>
            <p> INT. CHURCH FOYER - THAT MOMENT</p>
            <p> Once in the privacy of the foyer, Peggy and Maggie talk.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              He's going to be the pastor?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yep. I want him to be front and center <br>
              and to watch everything.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              What happened at the luau?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (flustered)<br>
              ... I don't even want to talk about <br>
              the luau.<br>
              (then seeing a hanging rope)<br>
              What's this?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              It's for the bell.</p>
            <p> Cindy joins them.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              Bob's in a hurry.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Don't be nervous, Maggie. Let us <br>
              visualize. Remember what Bob said? <br>
              &quot;Be the ball.&quot;</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              &quot;Sink the putt.&quot;</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              &quot;Make the shot.&quot;</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              &quot;Nothing but net.&quot;</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              &quot;Never say die.&quot;</p>
            <p> Maggie puts her hands up.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Go!</p>
            <p> Peggy and Cindy exit. Maggie pulls the bell rope and sways back 
              <br>
              and forth as she rings the bell.</p>
            <p> INT. CHAPEL - THAT MOMENT</p>
            <p> It is Maggie's turn to enter. They all turn expectantly. Too <br>
              much time passes. Ted plays the organ, then stops. Maggie <br>
              swings back and forth in the foyer doorway.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Honey, are you okay?</p>
            <p> Maggie stops ringing the bell and pulls herself together. She 
              <br>
              walks into the aisle looking a little shaky. She takes a few <br>
              tremulous steps slowly with her eyes closed, peeking <br>
              occasionally with one eye.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (taking off his jacket)<br>
              At this pace, it could be an evening <br>
              wedding.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Hold it! Hold it! I think we're <br>
              taking this too fast.</p>
            <p> He begins to pace.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              We need to limber you up a little. <br>
              You're tensing.<br>
              (thinks a moment; <br>
              to Ike, moving him <br>
              to groom's spot)<br>
              You stand here and be me so she knows <br>
              how far she'll have to go.<br>
              (then to Maggie)<br>
              I'm going to walk with you.</p>
            <p> Bob goes to Maggie and walks behind her.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              Visualize! Visualize! It's game time.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Maggie walking.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              You are the football. You're spiraling <br>
              through the air towards the hands of <br>
              the groom.</p>
            <p> She proceeds down the aisle. Bob behind her.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (eyes down)<br>
              Yes, I'm spiraling through the air.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Maggie raises her eyes and sees Ike in front of her as groom. 
              <br>
              Ike and Maggie lock gazes. If they had to, they couldn't look <br>
              away. All the things unspoken are now communicated -- the love, 
              <br>
              the longing.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              I streak towards the goal line.</p>
            <p> Maggie's pace quickens.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              And I land on the goal line.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Bob beams to see Maggie's eager arrival at Ike's side. He <br>
              switches off the music and proceeds like a proud coach to be the 
              <br>
              pastor.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Okay, I'm the pastor. Dearly beloved, <br>
              blah, blah, blah. So on and so forth. <br>
              Ra ta ta ta. Yabada dabada. I now <br>
              pronounce you man and wife. Kiss the <br>
              bride, badum dum.<br>
              (then moving toward Ted)<br>
              We have the crescendo that leads to us <br>
              right back down the aisle and out the...</p>
            <p> Ike kisses Maggie. It is a world class, Olympic kiss. It is a 
              <br>
              kiss that changes everything and can never be taken back. It is 
              <br>
              a kiss you only get once in your life.</p>
            <p> NEW ANGLE:</p>
            <p> Bob's smile dies. Cindy's mouth drops open as the kiss goes on 
              <br>
              and on. Peggy loses control and screams.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              Maggie!!!!?</p>
            <p> Like a bucket of water thrown on two dogs, Ike and Maggie are 
              <br>
              startled out of their kiss. They pull apart and smile at each <br>
              other.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: Bob.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              (furious)<br>
              If you were imagining me, you did great.<br>
              (to Ike)<br>
              What the hell were you doing?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (eyes on Maggie)<br>
              I'm sorry, Bob. She kissed me back.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (dazed but happy)<br>
              I kissed him back.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Yeah, I caught that. Want to tell me <br>
              how long this has been going on?</p>
            <p> Maggie looks at Ike, wondrous, confused.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              About a minute...?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              A little longer for me.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Really?</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              What do you expect me to say to this?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              How about -- &quot;I hope you'll be very <br>
              happy together&quot;?</p>
            <p> Bob hauls back and punches Ike in the face. Ike drops.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              I hope you'll be very happy together.</p>
            <p> Bob storms down the aisle and out of the church.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (to Peggy)<br>
              Take care of him.</p>
            <p> Maggie leaves.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. CHURCH - THAT MOMENT</p>
            <p> Bob is halfway down the walk. Maggie appears at the church door 
              <br>
              and calls after him.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Bob, I'm sorry!<br>
              (half to herself)<br>
              At least I backed out before the <br>
              wedding. That's progress!</p>
            <p> He keeps marching. Now Peggy appears next to Maggie. Maggie <br>
              calls again.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Some woman is going to make you a lot <br>
              happier than I ever could...</p>
            <p> The words are barely out of her mouth when Cindy comes out the 
              <br>
              door, racing after Bob at a full sprint.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              See?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Well, Maggie -- in the words of Mrs. <br>
              Pressman: &quot;Holy moly&quot;. Call me later.</p>
            <p> Peggy goes to her car. Cindy joins her as Bob speeds off in his 
              <br>
              car. Now Ike takes Peggy's place next to Maggie. Maggie turns <br>
              to face Ike. They are both beet red, stammering and unable to <br>
              look at each other, trying to act normal.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Okay. So... what, uh... What just <br>
              happened? Just now? Jus then? In <br>
              there?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I don't know. I, uh -- I frankly don't <br>
              even want to talk about it.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Me, either.</p>
            <p> Ike GRABS Maggie and BOOM -- they are all over each other, <br>
              kissing frantically, tongues, hands, hair, elbow, you name it. <br>
              Blathering fools.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (blathering)<br>
              I love you. I love you.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (blathering)<br>
              I love you, too.</p>
            <p> They come up for air.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Wait. We have to talk. We have to do <br>
              some talking now. Pull up a railing.</p>
            <p> Maggie sits on the railing, then Ike backs up and sits on the 
              <br>
              opposite railing.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              You have to go down an aisle and say &quot;I <br>
              do&quot;. You have to get married.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              To who? Are you asking me?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Me?</p>
            <p> Ike backs up to opposite railing and sits facing Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yes, you!</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (thinks)<br>
              Well, you do have the dress.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              And the church.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              And the wedding date. There's the two <br>
              of us.<br>
              (beat)<br>
              So, you think... maybe... You have to <br>
              go down the aisle with somebody you <br>
              love and who love you back.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'm okay with that.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              So am I.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              So, we'll...</p>
            <p> They both nod and sit there smiling, sort of. The organist, Ted, 
              <br>
              closes the church door.</p>
            <p> TED<br>
              Good night.</p>
            <p> Ike pulls his tape recorder out of his pocket and quietly speaks 
              <br>
              into it.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I'm getting married.</p>
            <p> WIDE SHOT:</p>
            <p> They smile at each other and remain sitting. Then, silence.</p>

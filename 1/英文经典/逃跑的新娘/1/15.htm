            <p>ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Bob comes up to Ike. He looks like he's going to punch Ike, then 
              <br>
              abruptly holds out a rose boutonniere.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              You look awful.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (sarcastically)<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> Bob hands the flower to Ike. Ike is shaking. Bob catches this 
              <br>
              and looks up to Ike. It is a moment of clean honesty between the 
              <br>
              men.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Ike. Need help?</p>
            <p> He takes the boutonniere and puts it on Ike's lapel.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              I'm glad it's you.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Really?</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              I didn't want to find out I wasn't for <br>
              her in the fourth quarter.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Got any last minute advice?</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              (motioning to their eyes)<br>
              Maintain eye contact.</p>
            <p> Bob turns and leaves, going down a side staircase.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (to himself)<br>
              Eye contact. Eye contact.</p>
            <p> Out of the corner of his eye, Ike sees a pictures of Christ on 
              the <br>
              wall. He leans into the picture and whispers.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              Cover me.</p>
            <p> He walks into the chapel.</p>
            <p> INT. CHAPEL - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> Ike steps up and stands next to Fisher.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              (to Ike)<br>
              I have no idea what I'm doing.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Your job is... the ring.<br>
              (to Fisher)<br>
              Do you have the ring?!</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              I just found out I'm best man! I'm <br>
              lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?</p>
            <p> Ike gives the ring to Fisher. The Pastor approaches Ike. Ike <br>
              turns away and look out over the guests. </p>
            <p> IKE'SPOV: There are most of the TOWNSPEOPLE we've come to <br>
              know, plus some NEW YORKERS for Ike, with little ponytails. <br>
              Armani wire rims, Donna Karan bodysuits. There's a lot of <br>
              smirking, checking out the hicks, forming their stories for <br>
              cocktail hour. Elaine is in back all dressed in black, mourning 
              <br>
              Ike. Mrs. Trout approaches Ike.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              You should thank Lou and I for the <br>
              wedding car -- a '63 Buick.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              Oh, come on. You're practically family.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Trout starts picking lint off Fisher's jacket.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Hello. I'm Fisher.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              This doesn't want to come out.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              You just pull a hair from my neck.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Mrs. Trout, go back to your seat!</p>
            <p> INT. CHURCH FOYER - DAY</p>
            <p> Peggy joins Maggie, who is blowing bubblegum and swaying in <br>
              front of an oscillating fan. Grandma and Walter come in. <br>
              Grandma gives her a kiss on the cheek.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              Good luck, Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Thank you, Grandma.</p>
            <p> Grandma leaves. Walter steps up.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              (quietly to Maggie)<br>
              I'm really rooting for this one.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Thank you, Dad.</p>
            <p> Peggy turns off the fan. Cindy takes the bag from Maggie.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              Spit.</p>
            <p> Maggie spits her bubblegum into the bag. Peggy hands Maggie her 
              <br>
              bouquet.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Let's go.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No sauntering down the aisle. Just <br>
              make time. Let's just get there.</p>
            <p> Cindy and Peggy nod and leave. The door closes.</p>
            <p> INT. CHAPEL - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> Both extends his hand to Elaine.</p>
            <p> ELAINE<br>
              Hi, I'm Elaine from New York.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Hello. I'm Bob, Maggie's fourth <br>
              attempt.</p>
            <p> ELAINE<br>
              I'm sorry.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              That's okay. There's a lid for every <br>
              pot. Besides, I'm comfortable with Ike. <br>
              I mean, Jack Dempsey lost his <br>
              heavyweight title to a New Yorker.</p>
            <p> ELAINE<br>
              I know. Gene Tunney.</p>
            <p> The organ begins to play. The organist is Ted. Grandma, Walter, 
              <br>
              Mrs. Pressman and the Trouts watch. Mrs. Trout picks lint off of 
              <br>
              her husband's jacket.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Cindy and Peggy enter with the confident air of people who have 
              <br>
              done this before. They make it to the head of the aisle all too 
              <br>
              quickly. Peggy gives Ike a wink and an encouraging smile.</p>
            <p> INT. CHURCH FOYER - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> The door opens and Dennis sticks his head in.</p>
            <p> DENNIS<br>
              They're ready, Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Just a second.</p>
            <p> Dennis closes the door behind him as he goes back into the <br>
              chapel. Maggie has a moment alone. She looks at back door as <br>
              possible escape route, then changes her mind. She signals the <br>
              start of the wedding by knocking on the door.</p>
            <p> INT. CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> Immediately, Cory and Dennis open the doors for her entrance. 
              <br>
              All the guests stand as Maggie enter the chapel smiling.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE'S POV:</p>
            <p> The aisle stretches before her into infinity. Faces goggle at 
              <br>
              her from every direction. The tiny figure of Ike stands like a <br>
              beacon a long way off.</p>
            <p> NEW ANGLE:</p>
            <p> She plunges forward with a sped-up hesitation step.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Ike rocks imperceptibly, urging her on. Peggy and Cindy make <br>
              little &quot;come on&quot; motions. It seems to be working. Maggie 
              <br>
              approaches rapidly. The CROWD has turned from skepticism to <br>
              looks and noises of encouragement.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: MAGGIE</p>
            <p> But then her feet gradually begin to slow.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Fisher gives a little &quot;darn, so close&quot; look.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> But Ike is too busy maintaining eye contact. His eyes urge <br>
              Maggie closer -- loving her, willing her on.</p>
            <p> CLOSE ON:</p>
            <p> Maggie stops her walk, gives Ike a teasing smile, and then <br>
              resumes with her walk toward him. His face. Her face. His <br>
              face. Her face.</p>
            <p> CLOSE ON:</p>
            <p> Her foot inches forward. The other follows.</p>
            <p> NEW ANGLE:</p>
            <p> A sigh now rises from the GUESTS as Maggie closes in on Ike. He 
              <br>
              smiles at her. She smiles at him. She is almost there... She's <br>
              there, smiling at Ike. The Pastor gestures to the guests to sit 
              <br>
              down. They do.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Ike sneezes. She looks down and imagines she sees the carpet <br>
              splitting apart. And she bolts like a bat out of hell! In a <br>
              flurry of white, she is halfway down the aisle before Ike knows 
              <br>
              what hits him.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Ike stands there dazed. For a second. Then she springs into <br>
              action, charging after her.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (yelling out)<br>
              Block the doors!</p>
            <p> Like a general, he points to Dennis and Cory in the back and <br>
              sends them into action. The doors shut in Maggie's face. But <br>
              she's a wild animal cornered. She moves to the side. The <br>
              TOWNSPEOPLE stand so Ike can hurry through the pew. Ike climbs <br>
              on the pews towards her as GUEST crowd the aisle, blocking his <br>
              path. Like a gazelle, she leaps to the side aisle and scampers <br>
              down and away. Fisher gets on his cell phone. Ike charges from <br>
              one of the full pews, crosses the aisle and leaps across the pews 
              <br>
              near the staircase to cut her off. He grabs her veil and it <br>
              comes off in his hands. Maggie disappears down the steps of the 
              <br>
              church basement. Ike fumble with the veil and jumps over the <br>
              railing, landing on Dennis' toe. He follows down the stairs <br>
              after her. Mrs. Pressman and Walter exchange bet money.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> Maggie comes down steps and enters the church children's Sunday 
              <br>
              school class. A lot of KIDS And TEACHERS are doing religious <br>
              arts and crafts. As Maggie runs through:</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              There's a man coming down those steps <br>
              with lots of candy in his pockets. If <br>
              you tickle him, he'll give candy.</p>
            <p> She gives her bouquet to a little GIRL as she goes by. Ike comes 
              <br>
              down stairs.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Maggie!</p>
            <p> The KIDS mob him, grabbing his pockets. Ike fights his way <br>
              through KIDS.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Maggie as she's in the church kitchen and hops on counter and 
              <br>
              heads out the window. The window is wide enough.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Ike as he gets to the window, but Maggie is out in driveway.</p>

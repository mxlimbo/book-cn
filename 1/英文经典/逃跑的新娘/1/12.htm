            <p>EXT. TROUT'S BARN - THE NEXT NIGHT</p>
            <p> We hear Hawaiian music. We see a truck with GUESTS drive up and 
              <br>
              HULA DANCERS through barn slats.</p>
            <p> INT. TROUT'S BARN - NIGHT</p>
            <p> It's a small barn that's been converted into a luau with a bar. 
              <br>
              A BAND plays for two hula dancers. The Trouts had decorated it <br>
              as a little slice of Hawaii. There are tiki lights, numerous <br>
              rented plastic palm trees and fiberglass copies of Hawaiian <br>
              statuary. Strings of colored lights crisscross the ceiling. <br>
              It looks like a Hawaiian high school gym on prom night.</p>
            <p> Maggie's family, Mrs. Trout and people we've already met, and 
              <br>
              more, are here, milling around wit tropical drinks garnished <br>
              with umbrellas. Plastic leis abound and most people have <br>
              managed to find their old Hawaiian shirts. </p>
            <p> As we come in, the hula dancers finish their applause and Mrs. 
              <br>
              Trout announces. Hula dancers stop.</p>
            <p> LOU TROUT<br>
              Welcome to our annual country luau. As <br>
              you know, Betty and I got married on <br>
              the rim of the crater, Diamond Head.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              (grabbing the <br>
              microphone)<br>
              This year, we're dedicating our first <br>
              dance to the soon-to-be newlyweds, the <br>
              King and Queen of Hawaii, Maggie and <br>
              Bob.</p>
            <p> The couple enters. Bob is a goody bronzed god in his King <br>
              Kamahamela outfit. Maggie is spectacular in her authentic <br>
              looking Hawaiian Princess get-up. But her face reflects none <br>
              of the festivities around her. Every now and then, she looks up 
              <br>
              and glances around for Ike, hating herself for it.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT (cont'd)<br>
              King and Queen, dance.</p>
            <p> Maggie and Bob start to dance as the Quarter sings &quot;Aloha 
              Oe.&quot;</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT (cont'd)<br>
              Everybody dance.</p>
            <p> Everybody dances.</p>
            <p> TIMES OUT:</p>
            <p> Maggie and Bob pose for pictures with some of the guests.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              Pictures of the King and Queen.</p>
            <p> Dennis poses with Maggie. Cory poses with Bob. Mrs. Trout runs 
              <br>
              out of film and goes to get more, leaving Peggy and Maggie alone. 
              <br>
              Peggy whispers to Maggie.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Lighten up, wahine.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Lighten up, what?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              This party is for you and Bob. Get <br>
              your mind off the reporter.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. <br>
              It just gives me the creeps a little bit. <br>
              I'd feel better if I knew where he was.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (nods to door)<br>
              Would it?</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: Ike just entering the party. At least he tried. <br>
              He's got a tropical sheet wrapped around his pants and shirt. <br>
              He walks to the bar and is greeted warmly by Lee. Maggie gets <br>
              very flustered.</p>
            <p> PEGGY (cont'd)<br>
              What are you doing?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (after a beat)<br>
              I'm going to go dance with Bob. <br>
              Because he's the man.<br>
              (referring to her headdress)<br>
              I like those grapes.</p>
            <p> Maggie dances affectionately with Bob as Mr. Trout, tending <br>
              bar, greets Ike.</p>
            <p> LOU TROUT<br>
              Hey, Mr. Graham, welcome to our luau. <br>
              What can I get you?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You got something without a toy in it?</p>
            <p> TIME CUT:</p>
            <p> A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON</p>
            <p> A pair of expressive pantomime &quot;A Little Grass Shack&quot;.</p>
            <p> PULL BACK TO REVEAL:</p>
            <p> Mrs. Trout is on stage, introducing hula contestants. Grandma 
              <br>
              judges the Hawaiian dancing. The party is at full tilt -- a <br>
              little wild, a little goofy. Some guests (Bob, Cindy, Cory, Lee 
              <br>
              and Ted) do the limbo. Walter, Mrs. Pressman doesn't turn as <br>
              she hears him.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Aloha. That's a very fetching <br>
              headdress you're wearing.</p>
            <p> Ike leans into Maggie, enjoying the smell of her hair. She <br>
              notices, but acts casual.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Where did you disappear to?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Missed me bad, huh?</p>
            <p> TIME CUT:</p>
            <p> All the guests start banding their pineapple cups. Walter rises 
              <br>
              unsteadily, lifting his pineapple.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              Attention. Listen to Walter. Listen <br>
              close, he slurs.<br>
              (then)<br>
              Shut up, wahines!</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              In the tradition that has grown through <br>
              the years, it is now Toast Time! First <br>
              up, our host, &quot;A Honey of a Beekeeper&quot;, <br>
              Lou Trout..</p>
            <p> Lou Trout stands with his glass raised.</p>
            <p> LOUT TROUT<br>
              May the groom's heart be filled with <br>
              hopes and the bride's feet be filled <br>
              with lead!</p>
            <p> There are shouts of &quot;Hear hear!&quot; Walter roars.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              May the pitter-patter of little feet <br>
              not be Maggie's.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              May the gifts be returned!</p>
            <p> TED<br>
              May the back of the dress be as pretty <br>
              as the front!</p>
            <p> The laughter swells and swells, led by Walter.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Ike watches as Maggie takes the heat, raising her glass along 
              <br>
              with the others. Bob raises his glass like the good sport he is. 
              <br>
              Ike can't believe it.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              You know the old saying, &quot;You're not <br>
              losing a daughter...&quot; Well, I'd like to!</p>
            <p> Walter gets a bit laugh. He goes again.</p>
            <p> WALTER (cont'd)<br>
              Maggie may not be Hale's longest <br>
              running joke... <br>
              (under her breath)</p>
            <p> Maggie finishes the punchline along with his father.</p>
            <p> WALTER AND MAGGIE<br>
              -- But she's certainly the fastest.</p>
            <p> Uproarious laughter. Maggie looks terribly pained. Ike's had <br>
              enough. He pushes himself to his feet. Walter is thrilled. He <br>
              shushes the CROWD.</p>
            <p> WALTER (cont'd)<br>
              Oh, look, Mr. Graham, how about a toast?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I don't know, give me a minute. <br>
              (to Maggie)<br>
              Are you all right with this?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Excuse me?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Are you all right with this? You think <br>
              this is funny?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I don't and I don't think you should...</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              It's a joke. They're kidding.</p>
            <p> WALTER AND CROWD<br>
              (yell)<br>
              Come on and give us a toast.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You want me to make a toast? Okay... <br>
              I'll give you a toast. To Maggie's <br>
              family and friends. May you find <br>
              yourselves the bull's eye of an easy <br>
              target. May you be publicly flogged <br>
              for all of your bad choices and may <br>
              your noses to rubbed in all of your <br>
              mistakes...</p>
            <p> Ike watches their reaction. The silence is deafening. All the 
              <br>
              guests stare at Maggie. Mortified, she holds back tears.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              That was funny.<br>
              (a pause)<br>
              But enough toasts, let's hula. Let's <br>
              start the music up.</p>
            <p> She gets everyone up to hula. Band plays fast tune. Maggie <br>
              walks through the CROWD down the steps and outside. Ike <br>
              follows, but Peggy grabs a coat for her. Bob watches her go as <br>
              Cory approaches.</p>
            <p> CORY<br>
              Hey, Bob. I got twenty dollars bet on--</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Not now.</p>
            <p> Bob rushes after Maggie.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (calling after her)<br>
              Maggie. Maggie.<br>
              (to Ike, handing him a jacket)<br>
              Here. She may need this. It's not <br>
              really Hawaii.</p>
            <p> Ike exits. Then, Bob comes over.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Where'd Maggie go?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Oh, she just went to get me something <br>
              from the car.</p>
            <p> Cory comes over with Dennis to Bob and Peggy. BOB/PEGGY/CORY/ 
              <br>
              DENNIS CHUFFA: About Bart Starr and football. (Which keeps Bob <br>
              from going outside to follow Maggie). Bob thinks about it.</p>
            <p> EXT. TROUT'S BARN - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Ike runs after Maggie. He grabs her arm and turns her to him.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I'm the only goddamn person in there <br>
              pulling for you.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You humiliated me!</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No, Maggie, I defended you. <br>
              Humiliating you is what everyone else <br>
              is doing. It's the theme of this party.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I had it under control. Now they feel <br>
              sorry for me.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Well, they should. Because they're <br>
              about to watch you hang yourself again.</p>
            <p> Maggie has no response.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              -- Tell me something, do you really <br>
              care about Mount Everest?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              It's fun! It's high.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Or the sexual habits of locusts?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              That was very interesting research <br>
              George was doing!</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary <br>
              tattoo?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I already explained about that.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              And where you ever really going to run <br>
              the leper colony in Molokai?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (wincing)<br>
              Brian told you that?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Or maybe you just wanted to wear the <br>
              headdress.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Every one of those times I was being <br>
              supportive. Something you won't <br>
              understand.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Supportive? You weren't being <br>
              supportive. You were being scared. <br>
              Just like now. You are the most lost <br>
              woman I have ever laid eyes on.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Lost!</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              That's right. You're so lost you don't <br>
              even know how you like your eggs.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              What!?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              With the priest, you liked them <br>
              scrambled. With the Dead Head, fried. <br>
              With the bug guy, poached. Now it's <br>
              egg whites only, thank you very much.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              That's called changing your mind.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No, that's called not having a mind of <br>
              your own. What are you doing, Maggie? <br>
              You really want to let that man drag <br>
              you up Annapuma on your honeymoon? You <br>
              don't want to climb Annapuma.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yes I do!</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No you don't. You want a man who will <br>
              lead you down the beach with his head <br>
              over your eyes just so you can discover <br>
              the feel of the sand under your feet. <br>
              You want a guy who will take you into a <br>
              cave with a thousand candles just to <br>
              read you a poem. You want a man to <br>
              wake you up at dawn because he's <br>
              burning to talk to you and he can't <br>
              wait another minute to find out what <br>
              you'll say. Am I right?</p>
            <p> He's laid her flat. Maggie can't speak.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              Am I right?</p>
            <p> She fights back angry tears.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Stop. Stop it! I'm getting married on <br>
              Sunday, and you're just trying to make <br>
              me run! Why? Because you're a cynical, <br>
              exploitative, mean-hearted creep who <br>
              wouldn't know real love if it bit him <br>
              in the armpit! And all you do is tear <br>
              other people down and-and-and laugh at <br>
              them, and criticize what they do, <br>
              because you're too afraid to do <br>
              anything yourself! I read your column. <br>
              You never wrote one about you. I'm not <br>
              the only one who's lost and you know it! <br>
              Am I right? Well? Am I right?</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: Bob comes outside.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Mag. Help me out here. Green Bay. <br>
              Right guard.</p>
            <p> Both Maggie and Ike are breathing hard. Bob comes up to Maggie 
              <br>
              and gives Ike a very hard look as he puts his arm around his <br>
              fiancee.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              You know... Blocked Bart Starr, crewcut<br>
              ... Are you okay?</p>
            <p> Maggie adjusts her face as best she can.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Let me take you back inside, okay?</p>
            <p> She lets him lead her away.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Jerry Kramer.</p>
            <p> Ike looks at her drooped shoulder and he shakes his head and <br>
              walks to his car</p>

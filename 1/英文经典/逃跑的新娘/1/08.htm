            <p>PART 8</p>
            <p>INT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER</p>
            <p> Maggie walks towards Ike's room, checks that no one sees her and 
              <br>
              enters.</p>
            <p> INT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> Maggie lets herself in the modest room and turns on the lights 
              <br>
              on. She spots on audio cassette on the desk near the door. She <br>
              holds the cassette up to the light to read the hand-written <br>
              label. It says &quot;Miles Davis&quot; on it. She pockets the tape. 
              She <br>
              walks to the living room.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE'S POV:</p>
            <p> Ike has placed post-its on a framed picture, using the frame as 
              a <br>
              bulletin board. Post-it notes lay out the information he has <br>
              gathered under headings and subheadings. Parents &quot;Mother&quot; 
              <br>
              deceased, subheaded by &quot;Walter&quot; and there is one for &quot;Brian&quot;, 
              <br>
              &quot;Gill&quot;, and &quot;Bob&quot;. Maggie smiles and shakes 
              her head. She rips <br>
              one post-it down and reads it to herself.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (reads)<br>
              &quot;How does she get all these guys to <br>
              propose? She's not that beautiful.&quot;<br>
              (snorts)<br>
              Bite me, paper boy.</p>
            <p> She begins ripping many of other post-it off the picture frame.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              (as she takes post-its)<br>
              Rude...</p>
            <p> She's ripping them down, fast and furious, then shoves them in 
              <br>
              her shoulder bag.</p>
            <p> INT. ATLANTIC HOTEL HALLWAY - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> Ike comes down hallway as Harvey puts his shoes out to be shined.</p>
            <p> BACK INSIDE THE ROOM</p>
            <p> Maggie, looking around, discovers the wedding video on the <br>
              coffee table and grabs that, too.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Thief!</p>
            <p> THE SOUND OF A KEY IN THE DOOR makes Maggie jump. She flees to 
              <br>
              the bathroom, and shuts and locks the door. Just as Ike enters, 
              <br>
              he sniffs and looks around the room, instantly knowing something 
              <br>
              is up. He sees all his notes gone and a glimpse of Maggie as she 
              <br>
              closes the bathroom door. Ike is steaming. A BUMP sounds from <br>
              the bathroom. He goes over to the door and tries the handle. <br>
              It's locked. He starts to pound on the door.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              All right, I know you're in there... <br>
              You steal my research... You're messing <br>
              with the first amendment now. Open up. <br>
              Open up. You got no place to go.</p>
            <p> INT. IKE'S HOTEL BATHROOM - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> Ike's wrong. Maggie is already trying to open the first <br>
              bathroom window. It's stuck. She climbs over the bathtub, <br>
              opens that window and starts to climb out.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I want to have a very serious discussion <br>
              with you as to why you're such a pain in <br>
              the ass.</p>
            <p> We HEAR Ike slamming his body against the bathroom door.</p>
            <p> As Ike breaks in, he runs to the window and yells after her.</p>
            <p> EXT. IKE'S HOTEL WINDOW - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              That's breaking and entering. I'll call <br>
              the sheriff.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You do that. And remind him he's <br>
              bringing the wine to the luau. Thanks.</p>
            <p> She disappears around the ledge of the building and runs off. 
              <br>
              Ike's neighbor, Harvey, sits reading near his window.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Establishing.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> CLOSE ON: A CASSETTE PLAYER. We see the familiar handwritten <br>
              label: &quot;Miles Davis.&quot; &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; plays as 
              Maggie listens in <br>
              a chair, looking shell-shocked, surrounded by the post-its she <br>
              stole from Ike's room. We see as she reads them: &quot;Father, two-<br>
              fisted drinker,&quot; &quot;Peggy, best friend, but Peggy doesn't 
              totally <br>
              trust Maggie,&quot; &quot;Bob&quot; -- doesn't love him. Overwhelmed, 
              she <br>
              finishes reading the last note, leans back, puts her feet up on 
              <br>
              the table, deep in the mood of the melancholy music. </p>
            <p> The CAMERA MOVES on the last note on the floor next to her chair. 
              <br>
              It reads: &quot;SHOWS NO REMORSE&quot;.</p>
            <p> FADE TO BLACK.</p>
            <p> FADE IN:</p>
            <p> EXT. MAIN STREET/BEAUTY PARLOR - NEXT DAY</p>
            <p> It's early morning. Mrs. Pressman hands Peggy a cup of coffee 
              <br>
              to go. Peggy walks to the beauty parlor, unlocks the front door 
              <br>
              and goes in.</p>
            <p> INT. BEAUTY PARLOR - DAY</p>
            <p> Peggy enters and starts about her opening duties. She turns on 
              <br>
              the lights and turns and sees her friend, Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Do you think I flirt with Cory?</p>
            <p> Peggy stops in her track. Maggie is sitting curled up in a salon 
              <br>
              chair. She looks like she hasn't slept.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Good morning to you, too. You look good.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Thank you. Do you think I flirt with <br>
              Cory?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> Maggie looks miserable.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I don't mean it.</p>
            <p> Peggy moves to the salon mirror near Maggie with her cup of <br>
              coffee.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              I know. I think sometimes you just <br>
              sort of spaz-out with random excess <br>
              flirtation energy and it just lands on <br>
              anything male that moves.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              On anything male that moves? As <br>
              opposed to anything male that doesn't <br>
              move?</p>
            <p> Peggy pours her coffee out of its Styrofoam cup into a ceramic 
              mug.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Like certain kinds of coral.</p>
            <p> Peggy sits in the salon chair next to Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'm going to kill myself.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Why?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Because you think I'm all like... &quot;Hey <br>
              man, check me out&quot;.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (friendly)<br>
              No, I don't think you're like, &quot;I'm <br>
              charming and mysterious in a way that <br>
              even I don't understand and something <br>
              about me is crying out for protection <br>
              from a big man like you&quot;. Very hard <br>
              to compete with. Especially to us <br>
              married women who have lost our mystery.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              But you haven't lost your mystery! <br>
              You're very mysterious!</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              No. I'm weird. Weird and mysterious <br>
              are two different things.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              But I'm weird.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              No. You're quirky. Quirky and weird <br>
              are two different things.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Peggy, there's distinct possibility <br>
              that I might be profoundly and <br>
              irreversibly screwed up. Despite that, <br>
              I love you and I can promise that I <br>
              will no longer flirt with Cory, and I <br>
              beg your forgiveness.</p>
            <p> Maggie looks ready to cry.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              I'm not worried about you and Cory or <br>
              Cory and me or even that you're <br>
              irreversibly screwed up. But, Maggie, <br>
              you've been like this since we were <br>
              kids. And I think now that you are <br>
              aware of it and that it hurts people's <br>
              feelings, maybe it's time to move on <br>
              with your life and commit to someone of <br>
              your own, like Bob, if he's the one.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I think you're right.<br>
              (then)<br>
              Is there anything I can do to make it <br>
              up to you?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Something that brings warmth to my heart.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              Duckbill platypus.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at <br>
              three in the morning at a tick hunt. <br>
              It's not anymore.</p>
            <p> Maggie makes her funny face. Peggy doesn't laugh. </p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              You're right. It's not funny now. <br>
              Maybe we both grew up.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Thanks. Will you fix my hair?</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - LATER THAT MORNING</p>
            <p> Maggie exits her house, gets on her bike and rides off towards 
              <br>
              town.</p>
            <p> INT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER THAT MORNING</p>
            <p> Ike is still in bed. He slowly blinks awake, stretches, and is 
              <br>
              about to throw off the covers when Maggie's voice breaks the <br>
              silence.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Freeze. Hold on to those covers -- I <br>
              didn't come here to see Ike Junior.</p>
            <p> Maggie smiles cheerfully at Ike from the foot of the bed. He <br>
              narrows his eyes at her.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I take it the desk clerk is one of your <br>
              many admirers.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (deadpan)<br>
              How do I do it? I'm not that beautiful.</p>
            <p> Ike notices Maggie is holding two coffees.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Coffee. Now.</p>
            <p> Maggie hands it to him.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You're welcome. Your notes made <br>
              interesting bedtime reading -- if you <br>
              like trashy fiction. Your observations <br>
              are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. <br>
              You must be very proud.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I'm not a boastful man. What's your <br>
              point?</p>
            <p> Ike puts a shirt on as Maggie speaks.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              My point is that one again, you're <br>
              getting it all wrong. That won't <br>
              improve your reputation any, and it's <br>
              not very flattering to me either. So, <br>
              I'm going to give you a chance to write <br>
              the truth.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Really.</p>
            <p> Maggie turns away from him as he dresses.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I've decided to cooperate and let you <br>
              interview me.<br>
              (beat)<br>
              For a thousand bucks.</p>
            <p> Ike clears his throat as he stands putting his pants on.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              I want a big wedding and a killer dress <br>
              and for a grand I will answer all your <br>
              questions and let you follow me around.</p>
            <p> Ike takes his coffee with him as he picks up his glasses, puts 
              <br>
              them on and crosses to the window.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              My magazine doesn't pay because for <br>
              stories. It's not what you call ethical.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Oh, but making up the facts as you go <br>
              along is ethical? Actually, I meant <br>
              you. You probably got severance or <br>
              expenses or both. I'll take your check. <br>
              No credit cards.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (to Maggie)<br>
              You've seen the post-its. I've already <br>
              got more juicy material than I need. <br>
              Why should I pay you dollar one?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Because I think you're writing on spec <br>
              and with a first person interview, you <br>
              might actually sell that thing.</p>
            <p> Ike knows she's right.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Too much.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Seven-fifty.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Five hundred.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Six-fifty.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Done.</p>
            <p> Scowling, he writes out the check and hands it to her. Maggie 
              <br>
              looks at it and smile sweetly.</p>

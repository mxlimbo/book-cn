              EXT. USA TODAY LOADING DOCK - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike rides sadly on the back of a forklift, gets off and walks 
              <br>
              out.</p>
            <p> EXT. HALE RESIDENTIAL STREET - ANOTHER MORNING</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON MAGGIE'S HOUSE:</p>
            <p> A train goes by. A modest clapboard house with a porch. Two <br>
              entrances. A PAPERBOY tosses a paper onto the lawn in front of <br>
              the house. The front door opens and Maggie appears fresh out of 
              <br>
              bed, wearing only a jacket and panties. Heedless of being seen <br>
              this way, she scampers out to the sidewalk to pick up her <br>
              delivered paper: USA Today. She tears off the plastic bag and <br>
              rips into it, looking for her letter. She finds it. A smile on <br>
              her face, then she scampers back into the house.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - THAT MOMENT</p>
            <p> Maggie skips back into her house which she shares with Father 
              <br>
              and Grandma. A cozy and eclectic place creatively furnished on <br>
              a shoe-string. She rushes into: KITCHEN WHERE BOB KELLY, <br>
              fiance #4, is packing cans into a backpack. Bob, 38, has a <br>
              pleasant face and a body that is almost shockingly buff. He's <br>
              wearing a T-shirt that reads: &quot;Mountaineers Do It Against the 
              <br>
              Wall.&quot;, Maggie dances over, waving the paper and singing.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              She canned him, she canned him...</p>
            <p> Bob test the weight of the backpack adding dehydrate food.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Come here, Mag, and try this on.</p>
            <p> Maggie puts the paper on the kitchen counter and starts to read 
              <br>
              aloud, paying no mind to Bob, who is sticking her arms through <br>
              the straps of the backpack.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Listen: &quot;Dear Ms. Carpenter, I <br>
              apologize to you for this unfortunate <br>
              matter. Ike Graham's column will no <br>
              longer be appearing in this paper. <br>
              Best of luck in you upcoming marriage!&quot;</p>
            <p> Bob continues to hold up the weight of the backpack as he straps 
              <br>
              it onto Maggie's shoulders.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              That-a-girl! You sacked him.<br>
              (checking pack)<br>
              This is the weight of the pack you're <br>
              going to have to carry in the Himalayas. <br>
              Tell me if it's too heavy.</p>
            <p> Bob lets go and Maggie FALLS BACKWARD, disappearing behind the 
              <br>
              counter, and hitting the floor, with a THUD. Bob looks down at <br>
              her. Maggie's voice rises from the floor behind the counter.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (o.s.)<br>
              It's a little... It's a little heavy... <br>
              Help me, baby.</p>
            <p> Bob has no answer. He reaches a hand down. He yelps as Maggie 
              <br>
              pulls him down on top of her, out of frame. We HEAR them giggle 
              <br>
              and kiss.</p>
            <p> INT. USA TODAY LOADING DOCK - ANOTHER DAY</p>
            <p> Fisher uses the dock for a photo shoot featuring men and women 
              <br>
              in evening and formal wear from Escada for G.Q. Fisher is not <br>
              actually shooting the camera, but rather supervising it. <br>
              Fisher claps his hands and calls the models to attention. Then <br>
              he goes onto the stage and sets the models in their positions.</p>
            <p> FISHER (cont'd)<br>
              Remember, we are putting the &quot;fun&quot; back <br>
              into formal.<br>
              (to Ike)<br>
              I just say that for the agency guys. I <br>
              don't even know what that means. Now <br>
              follow me.</p>
            <p> INT. USA TODAY OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Elevator doors open. Ike and Fisher exit and walk towards the 
              <br>
              coffee table.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride <br>
              piece, and since I do freelance stuff <br>
              for G.Q., I'm in a different position <br>
              now...</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              What are you trying to say to me, Fish?</p>
            <p> They stop walking.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Vindication. How would you like to get <br>
              some? A chance to prove that, though <br>
              your facts weren't entirely straight, <br>
              your theory was correct.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (hiding his hope)<br>
              The real story on Miss Carpenter.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              All the gory details.</p>
            <p> They start walking again.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (excited)<br>
              The anatomy of the black widow spider <br>
              of Maryland.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              It wouldn't be a bad way to get you <br>
              back into writing feature pieces <br>
              again.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (enthusiastically)<br>
              This is good. It is a good story, <br>
              Fish.</p>
            <p> They stop at the coffee table and grab something to eat.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              (nods)<br>
              If she runs, then it's a cover story. <br>
              All true. All accurate.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (confesses)<br>
              Okay, you were right. I hated my <br>
              column, but I can do this assignment.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Then you've got it. If you leave <br>
              tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll <br>
              have plenty of time before her next <br>
              wedding trot.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              &quot;Paid vindication&quot; That's what I call <br>
              justice.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Justice, yes. Paid, I don't know. <br>
              They like the idea, but my hands are <br>
              tied with budget restraints.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              But I'll get my normal fee, right?</p>
            <p> He walks away.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You want me to do it on spec?!</p>
            <p> He follows him.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. MARYLAND HIGHWAY - DAY</p>
            <p> We see Ike driving down the highway. The car sputters a little 
              <br>
              as he and Fisher continue their conversation in voice-over. (If 
              <br>
              needed by the editor.)</p>
            <p> FISHER (V.O.)<br>
              Don't say &quot;spec&quot; like it's a dirty word. <br>
              Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a <br>
              play! Plato never got a book advance...</p>
            <p> IKE (V.O.)<br>
              Oh yeah! I happen to know from <br>
              reliable sources that Nietzche got <br>
              expenses and a rental car.</p>
            <p> We hear Fisher laugh.</p>
            <p> IKE (V.O.; cont'd)<br>
              I'm going to make this work, Fish. I'm <br>
              going to do it!</p>
            <p> Ike's car drives into Hale, passing a billboard reading, <br>
              &quot;Welcome to Hale.&quot;</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. HALE STREET - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike drives down picturesque Main Street. He passes Hale <br>
              Hardware. Sign says: &quot;At Curl. Be back soon.&quot;</p>
            <p> EXT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - DAY</p>
            <p> A BARBERSHOP QUARTET is singing in front of the only hotel in 
              <br>
              town. Ike pulls up and goes inside.</p>
            <p> INT. LOBBY/ATLANTIC HOTEL - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike has checked into the Atlantic Hotel. The clerk, LEE, hands 
              <br>
              him his key. Ike asks about room service and the restaurant. <br>
              An OLDER WOMAN asks him if he plays bridge as he goes up the <br>
              stairs to his room.</p>
            <p> EXT. HALE MAIN STREET - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike exits his hotel as the Barber Shop Quartet finishes singing 
              <br>
              &quot;Camptown Races.&quot;</p>
            <p> He now walks down the charming main artery of the town, looking 
              <br>
              exactly like what he is: a cynical New York out of his element <br>
              on sunny Main Street, USA. KIDS ride by on bikes, streaming <br>
              balloons behind them. A balloon hits Ike on the face. As he <br>
              crosses the street, he mutters into his tape recorder:</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I think I'm in Maryberry.</p>
            <p> Flags hang on all the storefronts and the place sparkles with 
              <br>
              wholesome attitudes as PEOPLE greet each other familiarly. Ike <br>
              comes to beauty parlor called &quot;Curl Up and Dye&quot;. The place 
              is <br>
              doing business and crowded with WOMEN.</p>
            <p> INT. BEAUTY PARLOR - DAY</p>
            <p> Cindy, the manicurist, does Mrs. Pressman's nails. Maggie sits 
              <br>
              on the floor next to Peggy's salon chair, fixing the base of a <br>
              barber chair. She tightens a screw and looks up, satisfied. <br>
              Cindy's dog is on the floor near Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Cindy, you better 86 Sprout. He seems <br>
              to be enjoying the petroleum <br>
              distillates.</p>
            <p> Cindy rolls over in her chair, picks up her dog and rolls back 
              <br>
              to her station.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              That's it. Back to obedience school.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (to Peggy)<br>
              Okay -- have a seat... gently, <br>
              carefully.</p>
            <p> Peggy sits in the chair. Maggie spins her around and around.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (delighted as <br>
              she spins)<br>
              You're a goddess!</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I didn't even need to change this <br>
              gasket, just put in a little hydraulic <br>
              fluid.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Stop it. When you talk like that, I <br>
              get turned on and it frightens me.</p>
            <p> JUST THEN. Ike enters the salon, taking off his sunglasses. <br>
              Peggy hops off the chair.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Hello. I'm looking for Maggie <br>
              Carpenter. There was a sign at the <br>
              hardware store across the street...</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Are you a reporter?</p>
            <p> It's a little early in the game for Ike to be thrown off guard.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (shocked)<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (eyeing his loafers)<br>
              It's been our experience that anyone <br>
              with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers <br>
              ends up being another big city reporter <br>
              wanting to interview Maggie.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              About her upcoming wedding and all.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              No, about her getting that asshole from <br>
              New York fired.</p>
            <p> Ike smiles down at his loafers and shrugs.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I am just such a reporter. And you are?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Peggy Phleming. Not the ice skater.</p>
            <p> Peggy steps aside. Ike moves toward Cindy and Mrs. Pressman.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              And who are these lovely ladies?</p>
            <p> Te ladies shake his hand and introduce themselves.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              Cindy. Maggie's unmarried cousin.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              Mrs. Pressman. No relation.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              And you are?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (turning toward her)<br>
              Looking for Maggie.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Yep. Maggie -- Someone to see you.</p>
            <p> Maggie looks over from her sitting position on the floor. She 
              <br>
              gives Ike the once-over, focusing on the shoes.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (yelling to Peggy)<br>
              Reporter?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Yup!</p>
            <p> Ike crouches to see Maggie on the floor just as she rises to her 
              <br>
              feet. Ike straightens up. For a moment, he is thrown by her <br>
              beauty and intelligent eyes.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I hope you have a different angle. <br>
              It's pretty much all been covered.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Originality is my speciality.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Excellent.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in <br>
              here unless they're getting haircut.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              She's the boss.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Sorry, no. I just got one.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              (to Ike)<br>
              Excuse me, sir. I have an actual fact <br>
              for you.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (steps to Mrs. Pressman)<br>
              Yes, Mrs. Pressman.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              It's her fourth time to the altar, you <br>
              know. Not seven like they said.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I know. Tell me something. Do you <br>
              think she's going to make it all the <br>
              way this time?</p>
            <p> During the Ike/Mrs. Pressman exchange, Maggie looks at Ike. <br>
              There's something familiar about him. She looks over at Peggy <br>
              and beckons her to a copy of Ike's column affixed to a mirror. <br>
              A goatee and horns, have been scrawled on Ike's byline picture. 
              <br>
              He's been &quot;devilized&quot;. Peggy coughs as she recognizes 
              Ike in <br>
              the newspaper clipping.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              She swallowed her gun.</p>

<p>Wonderful world</p>
<pre>
Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about science books
Don't know much about the french I took
But I do know I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be

Don't know much about geography
Don't know much trigonometry
Don't know much about algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for
But I do know one and one is two
And if this one could be with you
What a wonderful world this would be

Now  I don't claim to be an A student
But I'm try to be
For maybe by being an A student
I could win your love for me

Wonderful world for you and me
Wonderful world for you and me

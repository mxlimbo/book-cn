<p>Crocodile rock</p>
<pre>
I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold chevy and a place of my own
But the biggeest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the crocodile rock
While the other kids were rocking round the clock
We were hopping and bobbing to the crocodile rock

Well crocodile rocking something shocking
Markes your feet just can't keep still
Never knew me a better time
And I guess I never will
Oh lawdy mama friday night
When Suzie wore her dreese tight
Crocodile rocking was out of sight

La La La La

When the years went by and rock just died
Suzie went and left a foreing guy
Lond nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my chevy and my old blue jeans
But they never killed the thrills we got
When they up to the crocodile rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the crocodile rock would last

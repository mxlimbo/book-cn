<p>Young girl</p>
<pre>
You've got the charm of a woman
You've kept the secret of your youth
You let me to believe
You're old enough to give me love
But now it hurts to know the truth
Woah , woah , young girl get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run girl , you're much too young girl
Beneath your perfume and make
You're just a baby in disguise
Even though you know
That it's wrong to be alone with me
That come on look is in your eyes

Woah , woah , young girl get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run girl , you're much tto young girl

So hurry home to your mama
I'm sure she wonders where you are
Get out of here
before I have the time to change my mind
Cause I'm afraid we'll too far

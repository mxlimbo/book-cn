<p>Reality</p>
<pre>
Met you by surprise I didn't realise
That my life would change forever
Saw you standing there
I didn't know I'd care
There was something special
in the air

Dreams are my reality
The only kind of real fantasy
Illusions are a common thing
I try to live in dreams
It seems as it's meant to be

Dreams are my reality
A different kind of reality
I dream of loving in the night
And loving seems alright
Although it's only fantasy

If you do exist honey don't resist
Show me a new way of loving
Tell me that it's true show me
what you do
I feel something special about you

Dreams are my reality
The only kind of reality
Maybe my foolishness is past
And maybe now at last
I'll see how the real thing can be

Dreams are my reality
A wonderous world where I like to be
I dream of holding you all night
And holding you seems right
Perhaps that's my reality

Met you by surprise I didn't realise
That my love would change forever
Tell me that it's true feeling
that are new
I feel something special about you

Dreams are my reality
A wonderous world where I like to be
Illusions are a common thing
I try to live in dreams
Although it's only fantasy

Dreams are my reality
I like to dream of you close to me
I dream of loving in the night
And loving you seems right
Perhaps that's my reality

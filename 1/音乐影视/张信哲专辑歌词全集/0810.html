<p>Loving you loving me</p>
<pre>
Loving you more than 
Music loves an orchestra
More than freedom loves America
There are no words to say this right
You are the morning in the light
You are a night of love, an island
You are the shining and the star
And when I'm sure I've gone too far
I turned around and there you are

Loving me, and I know that
I need nothing more
Love above the love 
I've known before
A breath a life to fill my heart
With no such place as far apart
You are a night of love, an island
You are a night of love, an island
You are the shining and the star
And when I'm sure I've gone too far
I turned around and there you are
Loving me loving you loving me

There are words to say this right
You are the morning in the light
You are a night of love, an island
You are the shining and the star
And when I'm sure I've gone too far
I turned around and there you are
Loving me loving you
Loving me loving you loving me...

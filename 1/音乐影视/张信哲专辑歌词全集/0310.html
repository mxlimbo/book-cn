<p>Almost over you</p>
<pre>
I saw an old friend of ours today
He asked about you
I didn't quite know what to say

Heard you been makin' the rounds
round here
While I've been tryin' to make tears
disappear

Now I'm almost over you
I've almost shook these blues
So when you come back around
After painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you

You're such a sly one with your cold
cold heart
Maybe leavin' came easy
But it tore me apart
Time heals all wounds , they say

And I should know 'cause it seems
Like forever but I lettin' you go

I can't forgive you and soon I'll
Forget all the shattered dreams
All though you left me with
nothing to show
Full of misery

When you come back around
After painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you

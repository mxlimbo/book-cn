<p>Have I told you lately</p>
<pre>
Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one else above you
You fill my heart with gladness
Take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles that's what you do

For the morning sun and all it's glory
Greets the day with hope and comfort too
You fill my heart with laughter
And somehow you make it better
Ease my troubles that's what you do

There's a love that's divine
And it's your's and it's mine, like the sun, ooh
And at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray, to the one, to the one

You fill my heart with laughter
And somehow you make it better
Ease my troubles that's what you do

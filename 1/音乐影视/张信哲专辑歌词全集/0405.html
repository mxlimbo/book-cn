<p>Key largo</p>
<pre>
Wrapped around each other
Trying so hard to stay warm
That first cold winter together
Lying in each others arms
Watching those old cold leaves
alling in love so desparately
Honey , I was your head
And you were my leading lady

We had it all
Just like bogey and macall
Staring in a own , let it show
Sailing away to key largo
Heres locking at you kid
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again I know
Just like they did in key largo

Honey can't you remember well
Playing all the parts
That sweet scene of surrender
When you gave me your heart
Please say you will
Play it again
Cause I love you still
Maybe this can't be the end

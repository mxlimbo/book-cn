<p>You are my lady</p>
<pre>
Am I a fighter or a lover
When I do both, can I survive?
But I need a quiet time and reason
And I need you to feel alive
When I get rain without the rainbow
When all my plans are falling through
I leave the others 
Fighting over the rainbow
And I come running home to you

You're my lady
Come let me hold you
You are the star
I wish on every evening
You're my lady
You are my world tonight
My world tonight my lady

About as often as I grieve
I think of you and I am stronger
With faith to try again
Or question why again
To feel you close to feel so much
And if I face on endless sleep
You're all the things 
I choose to dream of
To make the night worth 
While I'll think about your smile
And of the days
When I could touch you

And early angel of the nights
And you spend the nights with me
In your arms my heart is hope
It's like heaven just to me with you
My lady come let me hold you
You are the star
I wish on every evening
You're my lady
You are my world tonight
My world tonight 
I breathe for you my lady
You are my lady

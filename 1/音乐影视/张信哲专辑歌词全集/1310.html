<p>The color of the night</p>
<pre>
You and I moving in the dark
Bodies close but souls apart
Shadowed smiles and secrets unrevealed
I need to know the way you feel

I'll give you everything I am
And everything I want to be
I'll put it in your hands
If you could open up to me oh
Can't we ever get beyond this wall
'Cause all I want is just once
To see you in the light
But you hide behind 
The color of the night

I can't go on running from the past
Love has torn away this mask 
And now like clouds, like rain
I'm drowning and I blame it all on you
I'm lost, god save me

Everything I am 
And everything I want to be your
Can't we ever get beyond this wall 
Cause all I want is just once
Forever and again
I'm waiting for you, I'm standing in the light
But you hide behind the color of the light

<p>Blue guitar</p>
<pre>
Play my solitary guitar
Recall the moments sweet and bitter
Until the emptiness is
Filled with dreams of you
Thoughts that drift 
From past to present
Wonder how your love is fading
Are you by any chance
Comparing me with him?

Ooh  Can I still cling to illusions 
That there'll be a solution?
Ooh  Am I a fool
still chasing shadows
Without a star to follow
But after all's said and done
I can't help wishing you well
I still believe time will tell

If he breaks your heart
If he turns away
I'll take up the part
I won't ever stray

So play, blue guitar
Play that sad refrain
Carry me so far
Till I feel no pain

Play on, blue guitar
Play that sad refrain
Carry me so far
Take me from the pain

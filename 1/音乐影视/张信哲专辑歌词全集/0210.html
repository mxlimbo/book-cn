<p>The twelfth of never</p>
<pre>
You ask how much I need you
Must I explain 
I need you all my darling
Like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love
I'll tell you true
Until the twelfth of never
I'll still be loving you

Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like April snow

I'll love you till
The bluebells forget to bloom
I'll love you till
The clover have lost its perfume
I'll love you till
The Poet run out of rhyme

Until the twelfth of never and
That's a long long time
Until the twelfth of never and
That's a long long time

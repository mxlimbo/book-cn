<p>True</p>
<pre>
So true, funny how it seems
Always in time , but never in line for dreams
Head over heels, when toe to toe

This is the sound of my soul
This is the sound

I found a ticket to the world
But now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line
Oh, I want the truth to be said

Ha,ha,ha,ha
I know this much is true
Ha,ha,ha,ha
I know this much is true(baby it's so true)

With a thrill in my head
And a pill on my tongue

This for the nerves that've just begun
Listening to Marvin(all night long)

This is the sound of my soul
This is the sound
Always slipping from my hands
Signs the time of its own 
Take your seaside arms and write the next line
Oh, I want the truth to be know

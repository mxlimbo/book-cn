<p>Too much heaven</p>
<pre>
Ooh, well, too much heaven

Ooh you and me girl got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you, and it flows through me
And I love you so much more
Than my love
I can see beyond forever, everything we are will never die
Loving's such a beautiful thing, ooh yeah
Oh, you make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away?

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain, and harder to climb

Ah, you and me boy, got a highway to tthe sky
We can turn away, from the night and day
And all the tears we had to pour
You're my life
I can see a new tomorrow, everything we are will never die
Loving's such a beautiful thing, so beautiful
When you are to me, the light above, meant for all to see
My precious love(to see my precious love)

Loving's such a beautiful thing, love's so beautiful
You made my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away(to fade away)

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river and harder to find

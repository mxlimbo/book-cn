<p>One day in your life</p>
<pre>
One day in your life
You'll remember a place
Someone touching your face
You'll come back 
And you'll look around you

One day in your life
You'll remember the love you found
Then you'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day
One day in your life
When you'll find that 
You're always waiting for
A love we used to share
Just call my name and I'll be there

You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day

One day in your life
When you find that 
You're always lonely
For a love we used to share
Just call my name and I'll be there

            <p>　　I don't know whether I'm now on the right track but in any case 
              I've extricated myself from the bustling literary world and also 
              escaped from my smoke-filled room. The books piled everywhere in 
              that room were oppressive and stifling. They expounded all sorts 
              of truths, historical truths to truths on how to be human. I couldn 
              't see the point of so many truths but still got enmeshed in the 
              net of those truths and was struggling hopelessly, like an insect 
              caught in a spider 's web. Fortunately, the doctor who gave the 
              wrong diagnosis saved my life. He was quite frank and got me to 
              compare the two chest X-rays taken on two separate occasions: a 
              blurry shadow on the left lobe of the lung had spread along the 
              second rib to the wall of the windpipe. It wouldn't help even to 
              have the whole of the left lobe removed. The outcome was obvious. 
              My father had died of lung cancer. He died within three months of 
              it being discovered and it was this doctor who had correctly diagnosed 
              it. I had faith in his medical expertise and he had faith in science. 
              The chest X-rays taken at two different hospitals were identical, 
              there was no possibility of a technical mistake. He also wrote an 
              authorization for a sectional X-ray, the appointment was in half 
              a month's time. This was nothing to get worried about, it was just 
              to determine the extent of the tumour. My father had this done before 
              he died. The outcome would be the same whether or not I had the 
              X-ray, it was nothing special. That I in fact would slip through 
              the fingers of Death can only be put down to good luck. I believe 
              in science but I also believe in fate. </p>
            <p>　　I once saw a four-inch length of wood which had been collected 
              in the Qiang region by an anthropologist during the 1930s. It was 
              a carved statue of a person doing a handstand. The head had ink 
              markings for the eyes, nose and mouth, and the word &quot;longevity&quot; 
              was written on the body. It was called &quot;Wuchang Upside Down&quot; 
              and there was something oddly mischievous about it. I ask the retired 
              village head whether such talismans are still around. He tells me 
              these are called &quot;old root&quot;. This wooden idol has to accompany 
              the newborn from birth to death. At death it accompanies the corpse 
              from the house and after the burial it is placed in the wilderness 
              to allow the spirit to return to nature. I ask him if he can get 
              me one so that I can carry it on me. He laughs and says these are 
              what hunters tuck into their shirts to ward off evil spirits, they 
              wouldn't be of any use to someone like me. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is there an old hunter who knows about this sort of magic 
              and can take me hunting with him?&quot; I ask. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Grandpa Stone would be the best,&quot; he says after thinking 
              about it. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;How can I find him?&quot; I ask right away. </p>
            <p>　　　&quot;He's in Grandpa Stone's Hut.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Where's this Grandpa Stone's Hut.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go another twenty li on to Silver Mine Gully then follow 
              the creek right up to the end. There you'll find a stone hut.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is that the name of the place or do you mean the hut of 
              Grandpa Stone?&quot; </p>
            <p>　　He says it's the name of the place, that there's in fact a stone 
              hut, and that Grandpa Stone lives there. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Can you take me to him?&quot; I go on to ask. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;He's dead. He lay down on his bed and died in his sleep. 
              He was too old, he lived to well over ninety, some even say well 
              over a hundred. In any case, nobody's sure about his age.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Are any of his descendants still alive?&quot; I can't help 
              asking. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;In my grandfather's generation and for as long as I can 
              remember, he was always on his own.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Without a wife?&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;He lived on his own in Silver Mine Gully. He lived high 
              up the gully, in the solitary hut, alone. Oh, and that rifle of 
              his is still hanging on the wall of the hut.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　I ask him what he's trying to tell me. </p>
            <p>　　He says Grandpa Stone was a fantastic hunter, a hunter who was 
              an expert in the magical arts. There are no hunters like that nowadays. 
              Everyone knows that his rifle is hanging in the hut, that it never 
              misses the target, but nobody dares to go and take it. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why?&quot; I'm even more puzzled. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;The route into Silver Mine Gully is cut.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;There's no way through?&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Not anymore. Earlier on people used to mine silver there, 
              a firm from Chengdu hired a team of workers and they began mining. 
              Later on, after the mine was looted, everyone just left. The plank 
              roads they laid either broke up or rotted.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;When did all this happen.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;When my grandfather was still alive, more than fifty years 
              ago.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　That would be about right, after all he's already retired and 
              has become history, real history. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;So since then nobody's ever gone there?&quot; I become 
              even more intrigued. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hard to say, anyway it's hard to get there.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;And the hut has rotted?&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Stone collapses, how can it rot?&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;I was talking about the ridgepole.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, quite right.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　He doesn't want to take me there, nor does he want to find a 
              hunter for me, so he's leading me on like this, I think. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then how do you know the rifle's still hanging on the wall?&quot; 
              I ask, regardless. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's what everyone says, someone must've seen it. They 
              all say that Grandpa Stone is incredible, his corpse hasn't rotted 
              and wild animals don't dare to go near. He just lies there all stiff 
              and emaciated, and his rifle is hanging there on the wall.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Impossible. With the high humidity up here in the mountain, 
              the corpse would have rotted and the rifle would have turned into 
              a pile of rust,&quot; I argue. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know. Anyway, people have been saying this for 
              years.&quot; He refuses to give in and sticks to his story. The 
              light of the fire dances in his eyes and I seem to detect a cunningness 
              in them. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you've never seen him?&quot; I won't let him off. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;People who have seen him say that he seems to be asleep, 
              that he's emaciated, and that the rifle is hanging there on the 
              wall above his head,&quot; he goes on unruffled. &quot;He knew black-magic. 
              It's not just that people don't dare go there to steal his rifle, 
              even animals don't dare to go near.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　The hunter is already myth. To talk about a mixture of history 
              and legend is how folk stories are born. Reality exists only through 
              experience, and it must be personal experience. However, once related, 
              even personal experience becomes a narrative. Reality can't be verified 
              and doesn't need to be, that can be left for the reality of life 
              experts to debate. What is important is life. Reality is simply 
              that I am sitting by the fire in this room which is black with grime 
              and smoke and that I see the light of the fire dancing in his eyes. 
              Reality is myself, reality is only the perception of this instant 
              and it can't be related to another person. All that needs to be 
              said is that outside, a mist is enclosing the green-blue mountain 
              in a haze and your heart is reverberating with the rushing water 
              of a swift-flowing stream.</p>

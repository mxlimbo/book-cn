            <p>　　&quot;Oh, you're playing cards,&quot; you say, putting on an 
              apologetic look. </p>
            <p>　　They go on with their game. The long paper cards have red and 
              black markings like mahjong, there's a Gate of Heaven and a Prison 
              of Hell. The winner penalizes the loser by tearing off a strip of 
              newspaper and sticking it on a designated spot. Whether this is 
              a prank, a way of letting off steam, or a tally, is agreed upon 
              by the gamblers and there is no way for outsiders to know what it's 
              all about. </p>
            <p>　　You beat a retreat, go back to your room, lie down again, and 
              see a thick mass of black specks around the light globe. Millions 
              of mosquitoes are waiting for the light to go out so that they can 
              come down to feast on your blood. You quickly let down the mosquito 
              net and are enclosed in a narrow conical space, at the top of which 
              is a bamboo hoop. It's been a long time since you've slept under 
              a hoop like this, and you've long since passed the age of being 
              able to stare at the hoop to lose yourself in reverie. Today, you 
              can't know what traumas tomorrow will bring. You've learnt through 
              experience everything you need to know. What else are you looking 
              for? When a man gets to middle age shouldn't he be looking for a 
              peaceful and stable existence, find a not-too-demanding sort of 
              a job, stay in a mediocre position, become a husband and a father, 
              set up a comfortable home, put money in the bank and add to it every 
              month so there'll be something for old age and a little left over 
              for the next generation? </p>
            <p>　　Chapter Two </p>
            <p>　　It is in the Qiang region halfway up Qionglai Mountain, in the 
              border areas of the Qinghai-Tibetan highlands and the Sichuan basin, 
              that I witness a vestige of early human civilization, the worship 
              of fire. Fire, the bringer of civilization, has been worshipped 
              by the early ancestors of humans beings everywhere. It is sacred. 
              He is sitting in front of the fire drinking liquor from a bowl. 
              Before each sip he puts a finger into it and flicks some on the 
              charcoals which splutter noisily and send out blue sparks. It is 
              only then that I perceive that I too am real. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's for the God of the Cooking Stove, it's thanks to 
              him that we can eat and drink,&quot; he says. </p>
            <p>　　The dancing light of the fire shines on his thin cheeks, the 
              high bridge of his nose, and his cheekbones. He tells me he is of 
              the Qiang nationality and that he's from Gengda village down the 
              mountain. I can't ask straight out about demons and spirits, so 
              I tell him I'm here to do some research on the folk-songs of the 
              mountain. Do traditional song masters and dancers still exist here? 
              He says he 's one of them. The men and women all used to form a 
              circle around the fire and dance right through to daybreak, but 
              later on it was banned. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why?&quot; I know quite well but I ask. I'm being dishonest 
              again. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;It was the Cultural Revolution. They said the songs were 
              dirty so we changed to singing Sayings of Mao Zedong songs instead.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what about after that?&quot; I persist in asking. This 
              is becoming a habit. </p>
            <p>　　&quot;No-one sings those anymore. People are doing the dances 
              again but not many of the young people can do them, I'm teaching 
              the dances to some of them.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　I ask him for a demonstration. Without hesitation, he instantly 
              gets to his feet and proceeds to dance and sing. His voice is low 
              and rich, he's got a good voice. I'm sure he's Qiang even if the 
              police in charge of the population register insist that he isn't. 
              They think anyone claiming to be Tibetan or Qiang is trying to evade 
              birth restrictions and have more children. </p>
            <p>　　He sings song after song. He says he's a fun-loving person, I 
              believe him. When he finished up as village head, he went back to 
              being one of the mountain people, an old mountain man who likes 
              good fun, unfortunately he is past the age for romance. </p>
            <p>　　He also knows incantations, the kind hunters use when they go 
              into the mountains. They are called mountain black-magic or hexes 
              and he has no qualms about using them. He really believes they can 
              drive wild animals into pits or get them to step into snares. They 
              aren't used only on animals, they're also used against other humans 
              beings for revenge. A victim of mountain black-magic won't be able 
              to find his way out of the mountains. They are like the &quot;demon 
              walls&quot; I heard about as a child: when someone has been travelling 
              for some time at night in the mountains, a wall, a cliff or a deep 
              river appears right in front of him, so that he can't go any further. 
              If the spell isn't broken the person's feet don't move forward and 
              even if he keeps walking, he stays exactly where he started off. 
              Only at daybreak does he discover that he has been going around 
              in circles. That's not so bad, the worst is when a person is led 
              into a blind-alley: that means death. </p>
            <p>　　He intones strings of incantations. It's not slow and relaxed 
              like when he is singing, but just nan-nan-na-na to a quick beat. 
              I can't understand it at all but I can feel the mystical pull of 
              the words, a demonic awesome atmosphere instantly permeates the 
              room, the inside of which is black from smoke. The glow of the flames 
              licking the iron pot of mutton stew make his eyes glint. This is 
              all starkly real. </p>
            <p>　　While you search for the route to Lingshan, I wander along the 
              Yangtze River looking for this sort of reality. I had just gone 
              through a crisis and then, on top of that, a doctor wrongly diagnosed 
              me with lung cancer. Death was playing a joke on me but now that 
              I've escaped the demon wall, I am secretly rejoicing. Life for me 
              once again has a wonderful freshness. I should have left those contaminated 
              surroundings long ago and returned to nature to look for this authentic 
              life. </p>
            <p>　　In those contaminated surroundings I was taught that life was 
              the source of literature, that literature had to be faithful to 
              life, faithful to real life. My mistake was that I had alienated 
              myself from life and ended up turning my back on real life. However, 
              real life is not the same as manifestations of life. Real life, 
              or in other words the basic substance of life, should be the former 
              and not the latter. I had gone against real life because I was simply 
              stringing together life's manifestations, so of course I wasn't 
              able to accurately portray life and in the end only succeeded in 
              distorting reality.</p>

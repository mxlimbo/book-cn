<A NAME="437"><H1>Appendix C -- Using WDMWIZ.AWX</H1></A>

<p>This appendix describes how to use the WDMWIZ.AWX custom wizard to build a driver project
for use with Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0. I built this wizard because I wanted an easy and
reproducible way to generate the sample drivers for this book. I've included it on the
companion disc because I knew you'd want an easy way to generate drivers as you read
through the book.</p>

<p>The WDMBOOK.HTM file on the companion disc tells you how to install this wizard on your
system. Once you've installed it, you'll find a WDM Driver Wizard item on the Projects
tab of the New dialog box that Visual C++ presents when you create a new project.</p>

<p>WDMWIZ.AWX is not a product and never will be. I would like to know about situations in
which it generates incorrect code, but I'm not planning to make any changes to the
admittedly clunky user interface. Furthermore, you're on your own as far as quality
assurance for your finished driver goes.</p>

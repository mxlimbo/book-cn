<p>I'm indebted to many people who helped make this book a reality. Devon 
Musgrave, Robert Lyon, and the rest of the team at Microsoft Press performed yeoman 
service in turning a rugged WinWord manuscript into the polished work you're holding 
in your hands. I know that Ben Ryan, the Acquisitions Editor for this project, 
logs countless hours and frequent flyer miles searching for great authors and sizzling 
new books; well, better luck next time. Microsoft's Sandy Spinrad, in just one of his 
many aspects, ably assisted by locating technical information, hardware for testing, 
up-to-date releases, and much of the other research material on which I relied. 
Many members of the Windows 2000 and Windows 98 base teams reviewed this material 
and deserve personal mention, but they've requested anonymity; they and I know 
who they are, at least. My seminar students and the online community helped in many 
large and small ways by asking thought-provoking questions or sharing hard-won 
insights. Finally, I want to thank my wife, Marty, who's always there when the going gets tough.</p>

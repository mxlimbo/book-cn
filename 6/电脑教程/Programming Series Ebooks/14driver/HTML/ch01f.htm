<A NAME="23"><H1>Other Resources</H1></A>

<p>This book should not be the only source of information you use to learn about driver
programming. It emphasizes the features that I think are important; but you might need
information I don't provide, or you might have a different way of learning than I do. I
don't explain how the operating system works except insofar as it bears on what I think one
needs to know to effectively write drivers. If you're a deductive learner, or if you simply
want more theoretical background, you might want to consult one of the additional resources
listed below. If you're standing in a bookstore right now trying to decide which book to
buy, my advice is to buy all of them: a wise craftsperson never skimps on his or her tools.
Besides, books on specialized subjects like driver writing often go out of print before their
useful life expires.</p>

<A NAME="24"><H2>Books Specifically About Driver Development</H2></A>

<p>Art Baker, <i>The Windows NT Device Driver Book: A Guide for Programmers</i> (Prentice Hall,
1997).</p>

<p>Chris Cant, <i>Writing Windows WDM Device Drivers</i> (R&amp;D Press, 1999).</p>

<p>Edward N. Dekker and Joseph M. Newcomer, <i>Developing Windows NT Device Drivers: A
Programmer's Handbook</i> (Addison-Wesley, 1999).</p>

<p>Rajeev Nagar, <i>Windows NT File System Internals: A Developer's Guide</i> (O'Reilly
&amp; Associates, 1997).</p>

<p>Peter G. Viscarola and W. Anthony Mason, <i>Windows NT Device Driver Development</i>
(Macmillan, 1998).</p>

<p>Dekker and Newcomer's book went to press as the Beta 2 release of Windows 2000 appeared
and contains just two chapters on WDM drivers. My publishing schedule was such that I
wasn't able to look at Chris Cant's book. Nagar's book, while nominally concerned
with file system drivers, contains a great deal of material that's generally applicable to
writing kernel-mode drivers of any kind. I don't believe in trying to evaluate another book
on the same subject as my own, inasmuch as you'd have a perfect right to doubt my
objectivity, so I simply present this list for you to use as you wish.</p>

<A NAME="25"><H2>Another Useful Book</H2></A>

<p>David A. Solomon, <i>Inside Windows NT, Second Edition</i> (Microsoft Press, 1998).</p>

<A NAME="26"><H2>Magazines</H2></A>

<p><i>Microsoft Systems Journal</i> occasionally has articles of interest to driver developers.
<i>Windows Developer Journal</i> usually has at least one relevant article in each issue.</p>

<A NAME="27"><H2>Newsgroup</H2></A>

<p>The <i>comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.nt.kernel-mode</i> newsgroup provides a forum for
technical discussion on kernel-mode programming issues. This is the place to go for support
from your peers.</p>

<A NAME="28"><H2>Seminars</H2></A>

<p>I conduct public and on-site seminars on WDM programming. Visit my Web site at <i>
<a href="http://www.oneysoft.com" target="_window2">http://www.oneysoft.com</a></i> for more information and schedules. Most other authors in this
subject area conduct seminars as well. This is how we pay our bills. Once again, I won't
presume to offer any evaluation. And I'm sure you'll forgive me for not giving explicit
pointers to information about my competition!</p>

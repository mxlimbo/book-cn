<P>You will no doubt encounter obstacles when developing Internet Explorer 
applications. Because keystroke problems are so common and so difficult to figure out 
when hosting the WebBrowser control, this appendix covers the keystroke problems 
that you might come across when hosting the WebBrowser control in MFC, ATL, or 
standard C++ applications. For information about other issues, refer to one of the 
reference sources described later in this Appendix or contact Microsoft Developer 
Support, as explained at the end of this Appendix.</P>

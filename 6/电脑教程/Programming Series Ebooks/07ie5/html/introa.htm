<P>When I first joined Microsoft, I was lucky to be hired as a developer support 
engineer on the Internet Client Developer Support Team. I feel that I was lucky 
because I was given the opportunity to work with customers who were creating 
Internet applications for the greatest Web browser on the market&#151;Microsoft Internet 
Explorer. During my time in support, I saw first-hand the exciting 
applications that customers were building using Microsoft products and technologies. 
Customers would often contact us for information about how to implement different features in their 
applications using Internet Explorer. These features included DHTML, scripting, and 
the WebBrowser control. As time went on, I learned a lot about writing applications 
for Internet Explorer and using Internet Explorer components. I used a lot of what 
I learned on a daily basis to help customers create 
the best applications possible. One aspect of my work concerned me, however&#151;I 
was able to help customers only when they called Developer Support with questions or 
problems.</p>

<P>I searched long and hard for a comprehensive book on programming for 
Internet Explorer to which I could refer customers, but I wasn't able to find one. So I 
decided to write my own. This book is based on the knowledge I acquired while working 
as a support engineer as well as information I have learned since moving to the 
development side of Internet Explorer. This book constitutes years of my own 
experience as well as the experience of those who contributed to it by providing 
suggestions, samples, comments, and so on. I hope you find this book helpful as you 
create applications for Internet Explorer, now and in the future.</p>

<P>Throughout the course of writing this book, many people have contributed 
in one way or another&#151;answering questions, providing samples, and so on. I'd like 
to start my acknowledgments by thanking the entire Microsoft Internet Explorer 
development team for creating by far the best browser on the market. Without this 
excellent product, browsing the Web wouldn't be so exciting, and this book 
wouldn't even&#160;exist.</p>

<P>More specifically I'd like to thank my friend Nick Dallett, who was 
previously with the Internet Client Developer Support Team and is now on the Microsoft 
Windows Update team. Nick spent hours upon hours helping me by providing 
technical reviews of my chapters and samples as well as providing a number of his 
own samples. Nick spent many sleepless nights and weekends creating these samples 
for this book: DHTML Ledger, DHTML Memo, DHTML Soup, DHTML Ledger 
Behavior, Ledger HTA, Memo HTA, and Page Controller. Having these samples made the 
writing of this book go much faster.</p>

<P>I would also like to thank the following people from the Internet Client 
Developer Support Team: Mark Harper, who reviewed the section on Code Download 
in <A HREF="ch05a.htm">Chapter 5</A> and whose comments provided more help than I could have possibly asked for; Jason Strayer, who answered some very tough Internet Explorer, DHTML Object Model, and Visual C++ questions; Mark Davis, who provided the AtlBehave 
sample in <A HREF="ch11a.htm">Chapter 11</A> and answered questions regarding the OC96 specification, the DHTML Object Model, and Visual C++; Jess Judge, who provided the 
ClientCaps and LinkBuilder samples in Chapter 11 and answered general questions 
regarding the Client Capabilities and Persistence Behaviors; Dave Templin, who debugged 
my WebBand sample and suggested fixes; Heidi Housten, who provided the TOC 
Behavior sample for Chapter 11; Rene Schuchter, who answered general Code 
Download questions; and Sharon Malmquist, who always pushed me to do bigger and 
better things. Without Sharon, I might not have been driven enough to write this 
book. Thanks also to the Internet Client Developer Support Team as a whole for the 
many long hours its staff put in to help customers understand how to develop 
applications for Microsoft Internet Explorer. Keep up the great work.</p>

<P>From the Internet Explorer SDK documentation group I would like to thank 
Jerry Drain and Dennis McCreery for help solving problems with the Internet 
Explorer headers and libraries. Also, I'd like to thank Matt Oshry for help with various 
documentation questions. Matt went out of his way to help me more times than I can 
count. I just have to say that the entire MSDN Online Web Workshop team has created 
the best documentation product I have ever used.</p>

<P>On the development side of Internet Explorer, I would like to thank Dave 
Massy, the Program Manager for DHTML Behaviors, who always went out of his way to 
help me. Dave assisted me tremendously by reviewing <A HREF="ch11a.htm">Chapter 11</A> and explaining 
some new additions to <I>IDocHostUIHandler</I>, and for that I am extremely grateful. I 
would like to thank Phil Cooper for reviewing <A HREF="ch04a.htm">Chapter 4</A> and for answering questions 
about HTML Applications and the DHTML Object Model. I think we all should thank 
Phil, as he is the person who created HTAs. Thanks, Phil, for hiring me as a 
developer on the Trident Extensibility team. It's been exciting so far and I hope the 
excitement never ends.</p>

<P>I would also like to thank the following people whose contributions 
helped enhance the quality of this book: April Hill from the Microsoft Museum for 
answering questions regarding Internet Explorer ship dates for <A HREF="ch01a.htm">Chapter 1</A>; Eric Berman 
for answering questions about Web Accessories; Sundaram Ramani for contributing 
his HTMLSpy HTA sample; Strohm Armstrong for his help with Explorer Bars and 
Desk bands; and Alan Auerbach for answering questions regarding the WebBrowser 
Control questions and events. Alan is another one of those people who always goes 
out of his way to help.</p>

<P>From Microsoft Press, I would like to thank Eric Stroo for helping me get 
this project off the ground; Victoria Thulman, the project editor of this book, for 
helping me with structure and content; and Julie Xiao, the technical editor of this book, 
for checking and double-checking all technical facts and code. In addition, thanks 
go to Joshua Trupin and Joanne Steinhart for help with publishing portions of this 
book in <I>MIND </I>magazine.</p>

<P>Finally, I would like to thank my wife, Andrea. I know that I dedicated 
this book to her but I just can't thank her enough. Throughout the many months 
that I was writing, she never once complained. She has always been supportive 
of everything I have done. Her support alleviated a lot of day-to-day stresses, 
which enabled me to finish the writing two months ahead of schedule. Thank you for 
always being there for me and for being the mother of my child. I'll say it again 
in Italiano: Ti amo moltissimo.</p>

<P>Microsoft Internet Explorer initiated many of these advances. Version 1 (shown 
in Figure 1-1), which was shipped as part of Windows 95 on August 24, 1995, made 
it easy to create Internet applications.</P>

<P>Using Internet Explorer version 1 and version 2 (shipped November 17, 
1995, and shown in Figure 1-2), you could create Web-based applications using 
standard HTML. Consequently, you could use Internet Explorer as a means of 
disseminating information all over the world with Web pages created using only HTML.</P>

</P>

<P>Your Web page users could also interact with you via HTML forms. 
Internet Explorer provided a way to build Web-based applications that allowed your 
customers to perform tasks such as ordering your products online without calling your 
company. These applications not only save your company a ton of money, they save 
your customers a lot of time and hassle: no more busy signals or waiting in a queue.</P>

<p>To help you understand when events are fired by the WebBrowser, look at 
Figure 7-5, which shows the sequence of WebBrowser events during a normal navigation. 
I've included only the events that pertain to navigating to a Web page that doesn't 
contain frames. (I didn't include events such as 
<I>ProgressChange</I>,<I> CommandStateChange</I>, 
<I>OnToolBar</I>,<I> </I>and so on.) Not all of these events are always fired. But 
<I>BeforeNavigate2</I> and <I>DocumentComplete</I> are fired at least once for every navigation except during 
a refresh, as I explained earlier.</p>

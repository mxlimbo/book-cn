<h1>What's My Constant?</h1>

<p>While this sample probably won't help you to learn more about
ADO directly, I've leveraged this code as a tool in other projects
and samples.</p>

<p>How many times have you checked the value of a property only to
realize that you don't know what constant or combination of
constants that value represents? If you were to check the Status
property of the current record of the Recordset object to try to
determine the cause of a conflict, would you rather see 2052 or
adRecConcurrencyViolation + adRecDeleted?</p>

<p>The What's My Constant sample doesn't contain any forms.
Instead, the sample is a series of class modules that you can compile
into an ActiveX DLL. Once you have compiled the project, you can use
the classes in your own projects. For example, say you had trapped for
an optimistic updating conflict in your code and you wanted to
understand what constant (or combination of constants) that value
corresponds to. You could use this dynamic-link library in your project
by adding a reference to the WhatsMyConstant library and then adding
the following code:</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr><td>
<pre>
Set objTranslateConstant = New WhatsMyConstant.ADOConstants
MsgBox objTranslateConstant.GetRecordStatus(rs.Status)
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>Now, rather than knowing only that the Status property returned a
value such as 2052, you would know the constant or combination of
constants in the enumeration that correspond to that value. In this
case the code would display the string &quot;adRecConcurrencyViolation
+ adRecDeleted&quot; in a dialog box.</p>

<p>The What's My Constant sample contains separate class modules
for ADO, ADOX, JRO, and RDS constants. Each function within a class
accepts a value from a particular constant enumeration and returns the
name of the constant (or combination of constants) that the value
passed into the function represents.</p>

<p>As someone who has learned a lot about ADO by trying to answer my
own questions, I've found this code quite helpful. In fact,
you'll see portions of the code in this sample appear in other
samples on the companion CD. You're welcome to compile the library
and use it in your own projects or simply copy portions of the code
from the sample.</p>

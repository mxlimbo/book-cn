<p><b>Q. <i>If I use only one Connection object,
does that mean I'll have only one connection to my
database?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> No. If you ask ADO to accomplish a task and ADO determines
that it cannot perform that task because the connection is busy, it
will establish a temporary connection to your database in order to
complete the task. This behavior is most likely to affect developers
using SQL Server who encounter the limitation of one active query per
connection. We'll talk about this more in <A HREF="ch07a.htm">Chapter 7</A> when we discuss
cursors, but keep that distinction in the back of your mind. One
Connection object does not equal one connection to your database.</p>

<p><b>Q. <i>Should I rely on Visual Basic, COM,
and ADO garbage collection, or should I close and release objects
myself?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> One memory leak can ruin your whole day. You should not
need to worry about collecting your own garbage, but you should do it
anyway. Close and release your ADO objects whenever possible.</p>

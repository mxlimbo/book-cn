<A NAME="193"><H1>Which OLE DB Providers Support the ADO Record Object?</H1></A>

<p>As of the release of MDAC 2.5, few OLE DB providers support the
Record and Stream objects. In fact, none of the OLE DB providers that
are scheduled to ship with MDAC 2.5 support them. The documentation
included with MDAC 2.5 focuses on the OLE DB Provider For Internet
Publishing because that's the most widely available and useful
provider that supports these objects.</p>

<A NAME="194"><H2>OLE DB Provider For Internet Publishing</H2></A>

<p>The full install of Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 ships with an OLE
DB provider designed to communicate with web servers such as Microsoft
Internet Information Services (IIS) 5. There's a growing standard
among web servers called Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning
(WebDAV), which defines a method of interaction with the files
maintained by the web server. This standard set of interfaces allows
web development tools such as Microsoft FrontPage to post new or
modified files to your web site.</p>

<p>The OLE DB Provider For Internet Publishing lets you use WebDAV to
communicate with your web site by using ADO. You can use this provider
and ADO to interact with your web site the same way that FrontPage
does.</p>

<A NAME="195"><H2>OLE DB Provider For Microsoft Exchange Server</H2></A>

<p>The Record and Stream objects are designed to make working with
&quot;document&quot; data stores (such as file systems and message
stores) simpler for programmers. One OLE DB provider that's
currently in the works and demonstrates this commitment to
&quot;nondatabase&quot; data is the OLE DB Provider For Microsoft
Exchange Server. You could use such a provider to communicate with your
mail server by using ADO instead of the Messaging Application
Programming Interface (MAPI) to build e-mail applications like
Microsoft Outlook.</p>

<A NAME="196"><H2>Future OLE DB Providers</H2></A>

<p>I see the Record and Stream objects as a step forward by the ADO
team to promote ADO (and OLE DB) as a truly universal data access
technology. In some ways, the OLE DB Provider For Internet Publishing
is an example of how developing an OLE DB provider can simplify
interacting with your data store. Perhaps more programmers will develop
OLE DB providers as a result.</p>

<A NAME="284"><H1>Dealing with Optimistic Update Conflicts</H1></A>

<p>Chances are that multiple users will be running your application
simultaneously. It's possible that more than one user will want to
modify the same record of data in your database at the same time. To
deal with this situation, most developers employ an optimistic updating
scheme rather than a pessimistic updating scheme.</p>

<p>Optimistic updating greatly decreases the likelihood that data your
users are trying to access is locked. The drawback to using optimistic
updating is that you generally need to write a lot of code to handle
the cases in which a user's updates to a record fail because
another user changed the same record.</p>

<p>The ADO Cursor Engine helps simplify the process of handling these
situations. ADO notifies you of such conflicts and provides several
ways for you to determine why the update failed so that you can take
the appropriate action. In <A HREF="ch12a.htm">Chapter 12</A>, we'll discuss detecting and
handling conflicts in greater detail.</p>

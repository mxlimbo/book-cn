<A NAME="246"><H1>What Is a Cursor?</H1></A>

<p>A cursor is a data structure that stores the results of your query.
In ADO, you can think of the Recordset object as a COM object that
simplifies accessing data in a cursor. The cursor type determines the
functionality available to a specific Recordset object: different types
of cursors support different levels of functionality. Some cursors
allow you to view changes that other users have made to the records
that make up the results of your query. Some cursors only let you move
forward through the results of your query, while other cursors allow
you to move forward and backward.</p>

<p>This chapter describes the different types of cursors and explains
the functionality available to the Recordset objects defined by each
type. Will you see changes made by other users? Will you be able to
determine the number of records returned by your query? Will you be
able to bookmark a particular record and move back to it later? What
happens when the cursor type you requested isn't available?</p>

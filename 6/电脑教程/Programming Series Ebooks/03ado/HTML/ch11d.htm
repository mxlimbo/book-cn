<p><b>Q.<i>  Since adResyncAutoIncrement is the default value for
this property, does that mean that the ADO Cursor Engine issues the</i>
SELECT @@IDENTITY <i>query after every insert? If so, if I want to
ensure that I get the best possible performance and if my Recordset
doesn't contain an identity field, should I set the Update Resync
property to adResyncNone?</i></b></p>
<p>
<b>A.</b>  The ADO Cursor Engine retrieves enough metadata to determine
whether your Recordset contains an identity field. If your Recordset
doesn't have an identity field, the ADO Cursor Engine will not
submit a <i>SELECT @@IDENTITY</i> query after inserting the new record
into your table. In other words, the answer to both questions is
no.</p>

<p><b>Q.<i>  Why don't I see the value
for the identity field in the new record I just inserted into my Access
database?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b>  Remember, this functionality was added to version 4 of the
Jet OLE DB Provider and works only with Jet 4 with Access
2000-formatted databases.</p>

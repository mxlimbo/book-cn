<p>As you'll see in the next chapter, the ADO Cursor Engine uses
action queries to submit the changes stored in your Recordset to your
database. Action queries are similar to a one-sided
conversation&#8212;that is, the action query does a lot of talking and
almost no listening.</p>

<p>At times you'll want to know more than just whether your update
succeeded, however. For example, perhaps you want to retrieve some
values generated by your server, such as timestamps, defaults, and
auto-incrementing fields. Recordsets that utilize the ADO Cursor Engine
expose a dynamic property called Update Resync that you can use to
retrieve such data. We'll cover Update Resync&#8212;how it works and
how to use it&#8212;in more detail in <A HREF="ch11a.htm">Chapter 11</A>.</p>

<h1>My Web Site</h1>

<p>The My Web Site sample shows how you can use the ADO object
model&#8212;especially its two new objects, Record and Stream&#8212;in
conjunction with the OLE DB Provider For Internet Publishing to build a
simple tool to access files residing on a web server. This OLE DB
provider is not actually distributed with Microsoft Data Access
Components (MDAC). However, it's included in the full install of
Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.</p>

<p>I built this sample to communicate with Internet Information
Services (IIS) 5 running on Windows 2000 Server, but I was able to use
the sample with Internet Information Server 4 running on Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0 Server as well, and with Personal Web Server running on
Windows NT 4.0 Workstation. The OLE DB provider uses WebDAV&#8212;a
standard that most web servers support&#8212;to communicate with the web
server.</p>

<p>For security reasons, web servers generally require that you have
administrator rights to the areas of the web site that you want to
access. Unfortunately, I am not an IIS security guru, so I'm not
sure exactly which settings you might need to use. I didn't change
any security settings on my computer running Windows 2000 Server and
was able to run the code successfully from it as well as from other
computers on the internal network at my office. Once you can connect
successfully, you should be able to run the sample without any
problems.</p>

<p>When you run the sample, it immediately displays a simple dialog box
prompting you for the location of the web site you want to manage. The
sample then connects to that web server using the OLE DB Provider For
Internet Publishing and displays the contents of the web site in tree
view.</p>

<p>From there you can copy, delete, move, and download files by
right-clicking them and selecting the appropriate action from the
context menu. You can also upload new files by right-clicking a folder
and selecting Upload File. Right-clicking a folder also lets you copy,
delete, or move that folder and all its contents.</p>

<p>The code in this sample is simple and straightforward&#8212;which is
why I created it. Using ADO and the OLE DB Provider For Internet
Publishing, you can manage the contents of your web servers with some
very simple code.</p>

<A NAME="1"><H1>Acknowledgments</H1></A>

<p>First and foremost, I'd like to thank my mother and father for
their constant support and patience.</p>

<p>I've been fortunate to have so many people point me in the right
direction at exactly the right time, allowing me to take advantage of
many opportunities throughout my programming career. As a first-time
author, it's my duty to thank too many people, though I'm sure
I'll unintentionally leave out some.</p>

<p>I'd like to thank Mary Sceppa and Hollis Graves for their
encouragement and advice as well as for the computers I used throughout
college. Thanks to Robert Welling for taking a chance and letting a
scared little kid run his billing system. I'd also like to thank my
extended family in the Seattle area, the Bramans, for helping me feel
more at home out here.</p>

<p>Thanks to all the teachers, administrators, and professors who
helped guide me through high school and college&#8212;especially James
Pender, Judith Bolles, Tom Brown, Linda Mahler, and Robert Gunning.</p>

<p>So many people at Microsoft have helped me during the past few years
in both technical and nontechnical situations. I'd like to thank
Clay Stephens for getting my foot wedged firmly in the door and for
getting me inside Microsoft. Thanks to my mentors, Greg Hinkel, Troy
Cambra, and Jon Fowler. I must thank Bill Vaughn for the foreword of
this book but primarily because <i>Hitchhiker's Guide to Visual
Basic and SQL Server</i> [Microsoft Press, 1998] was my bible when I
started in Microsoft Visual Basic database support. Thanks to Dave
Stearns for some of the clearest answers to questions about Remote Data
Objects (RDO) and the ODBC API. I hope this book will be as
enlightening as the volumes of mail he's sent me. Thanks to Jim
Lewallen and Greg Smith of the Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)
development team for answering so many questions about the goals and
uses of specific features. I'd also like to thank Don Willits for
helping me get this concept off the ground, Eric Schmidt for helping to
put me in touch with so many people on the development team, and Sam
Carpenter for keeping me (relatively) sane while I wrote this book.</p>

<p>Last of all, thanks to Mary Barnard, Alice Turner, Jean Ross, and
the rest of the editing team for putting up with a first-time author.
I'm sure you had no idea how much work you were signing up for.</p>

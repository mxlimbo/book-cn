<h1>Appendix B -- Companion CD Sample Code</h1>



<p>As I mentioned in <a href="ch01a.htm">Chapter 1</a>, I designed the sample code on the
companion CD to help you learn more about ADO. I'm all for
&quot;best practice&quot; code samples, but what works best for a
single-user Microsoft Jet database application won't work best for
a multiuser, multitiered application accessing an Oracle or Microsoft
SQL Server database.</p>

<p>I wrote the code included on the companion CD using Microsoft Visual
Basic 6 for a few reasons. Sample code written in Visual Basic is
fairly simple to follow compared to code written in Microsoft Visual
C++ or Microsoft Visual J++. Also, Visual Basic code doesn't
require Microsoft Internet Information Services to run&#8212;unlike
programming Active Server Pages (ASP) using Microsoft Visual InterDev.
The last reason is that Visual Basic is the language I'm most
comfortable with. I'd love to see better Visual C++ and Visual J++
samples that show how to use ADO, but I'm not the person to write
those samples. While the code on the companion CD won't help
someone who is new to Visual C++ or Visual J++ understand how to
instantiate ADO objects or COM objects in general, it will help
programmers who are experienced in those and other languages discover
more about ADO.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>I wish I'd known that before I started writing all this code.&quot;</i></p>

<p>You might be surprised at how often I've heard developers say
something to this effect after I've explained to them how ADO works
and what's going on under the covers.</p>

<p>For nearly four years I've been employed as a support
professional&#8212;inexplicably, we're no longer called support
engineers&#8212;in Microsoft Developer Support, working primarily with
customers who are having trouble using Microsoft Visual Basic to build
database applications. Lately, I've been surprised by the number of
programmers who are having difficulty building applications with ADO.
Discerning a pattern to the questions, I decided to write this book in
the hope of sharing my knowledge of ADO with a greater number of
programmers than I can speak to individually. If this book can help
reduce the volume of support calls I handle in the process, that's
a pleasant bonus.</p>

<p><b>Q.<i> Why can't I instantiate my business objects on my IIS
server with the RDS DataSpace object's</i> CreateObject <i>
method?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> You'll need to change some Registry settings in order to
allow access to these objects. MDAC does not enable this feature on
installation for security reasons. You'll need to run RegEdit and
then look for the following Registry key:</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr><td>
<pre>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\  &#140;
Parameters\ADCLaunch 
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>Now add the ProgID for each business object you want to expose
through RDS. For a more in-depth explanation, see the topic
&quot;Registering a Custom Business Object&quot; in the Data Access
Services portion of the Platform SDK Help.</p>

<p><b>Q. <i>Does using handlers make RDS safe across the Internet?</i></b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> That's an important question to ask but a tough one to
answer. While I have a lot of experience building two-tiered and
three-tiered database applications with ADO, I don't have much
Internet programming experience. If you want more information on
Internet security, read up on IIS and HTTPS.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend requiring RDS to use a handler to limit users'
access to your database. Handlers keep the location of your database
and the query string out of the client code. This allows you to modify
or move your database, and you need to modify only the appropriate
connection and/or query strings. You'll also keep your users from
obtaining information about what sort of database you're using,
where it's located, and so on.</p>

<p>Sometimes setting up anonymous users is helpful and appropriate. It
simplifies coding and lets you take advantage of OLE DB session
pooling. However, it's still anonymous.</p>

<p>You might decide that you need to store information about each
customer in your database and provide each customer with a password.
You can require that users supply their customer ID and password with
their orders so that you can track the orders appropriately. Now you
only need to make sure that you're using a secure connection
through HTTPS so that no one else on the Internet can access the
password supplied by the user.</p>

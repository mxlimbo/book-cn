<p>ADO 2.5 introduces two new items to the ADO object model&#8212;the
Record object and the Stream object&#8212;expanding ADO into a more
universal data access model. These two objects make ADO an effective
data access technology for more than just traditional data stores such
as Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, and Oracle. Before we
discuss the objects themselves, let's take a look at some of the
available OLE DB providers that let us use these new objects.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>As I write this chapter, Microsoft Data Access
Components (MDAC) 2.5 is in its final stages of development. The Record
and Stream objects might have changed slightly between the time I wrote
this book and the time ADO 2.5 (as part of MDAC 2.5) is released. Be
sure to check Microsoft's online Knowledge Base, as well as the ADO
Web site at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/data/ado" target="_window2"><i>http://www.microsoft.com/data/ado</i></a>, for the latest
and greatest information.</blockquote></div>

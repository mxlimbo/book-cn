<A NAME="1029"><H1>What's Not Covered</H1></A>
<P>It's not possible to cover every aspect of Windows-based programming in a single book. We exclude topics that depend on special-purpose hardware and software, such as MAPI, TAPI, and communications port access. We do cover <U>using</U> ActiveX controls in an application, but we'll defer the subject of <U>writing</U> ActiveX controls to Adam Denning and his <I>ActiveX Controls Inside Out</I> (Microsoft Press, 1997). We get you started with 32-bit memory management, DLL theory, and multithreaded programming techniques, but you need to get the third edition of Jeffrey Richter's <I>Advanced Windows</I> (Microsoft Press, 1997) if you're serious about these subjects. Another useful book is <I>MFC Internals</I> by George Shepherd and Scot Wingo (Addison-Wesley, 1996).

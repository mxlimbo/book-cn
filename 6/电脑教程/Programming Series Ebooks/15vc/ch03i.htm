<A NAME="48"><H1>Enabling the Diagnostic Macros</H1></A><P>The application framework <I>TRACE</I> macros are particularly useful for 
monitoring program activity. They require that tracing be enabled, which is the 
default setting. If you're not seeing <I>TRACE</I> 
output from your program, first make sure that you are running the debug target from the debugger and then run the TRACER utility. If you check the Enable Tracing checkbox, TRACER will 
insert the statement<P>
<PRE>TraceEnabled = 1</PRE>
<P>in the [Diagnostics] section of a file named Afx.ini. (No, it's not stored in 
the Registry.) You can also use TRACER to enable other MFC diagnostic 
outputs, including message, OLE, database, and Internet information.

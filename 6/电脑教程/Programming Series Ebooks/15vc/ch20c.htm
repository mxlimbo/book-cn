<A NAME="423"><H1>View Options</H1></A><P>When you combine multiview presentation methods with application models, you get a number of permutations. Here are some of them:
<UL>
<P><LI><B>SDI application with splitter window, single view class</B>  This chapter's first example, EX20A, covers this case. Each splitter window pane can be scrolled to a different part of the document. The programmer determines the maximum number of horizontal and vertical panes; the user makes the split at runtime.
<P><LI><B>SDI application with splitter window, multiple view classes</B>  The EX20B example illustrates this case. The programmer determines the number of panes and the sequence of views; the user can change the pane size at runtime.
<P><LI><B>SDI application with no splitter windows, multiple view classes</B>  The EX20C example illustrates this case. The user switches view classes by making a selection from a menu.
<P><LI><B>MDI application with no splitter windows, single view class</B>  This is the standard MDI application you've seen already in <A HREF="ch18a.htm">Chapter 18</A>. The New Window menu item lets the user open a new child window for a document that's open already.
<P><LI><B>MDI application with no splitter windows, multiple view classes</B>  A small change to the standard MDI application allows the use of multiple views. As example EX20D shows, all that's necessary is to add a menu item and a handler function for each additional view class available.
<P><LI><B>MDI application with splitter child windows</B>  This case is covered thoroughly in the online documentation. The SCRIBBLE example illustrates the splitting of an MDI child window.

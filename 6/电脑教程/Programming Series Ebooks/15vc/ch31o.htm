<A NAME="787"><H1>Bulk Row Fetches</H1></A><P>If you're using Microsoft SQL Server or another 
client_server DBMS, you can speed up your database access by using the bulk row_fetch feature of 
ODBC that is now supported by the 
<I>CRecordset</I> class. As the name implies, your 
program fetches multiple records from the data source instead of only one 
record at a time. The data source is bound to elements in an array that is attached 
to an object of a class derived from 
<I>CRecordset</I>. Currently, no MFC support 
exists for adding, changing, or deleting records from a 
bulk-fetch_enabled recordset. (See the InfoView article &quot;Recordset: Fetching Records in 
Bulk (ODBC)&quot; for details.)

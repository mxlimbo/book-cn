<A NAME="326"><H1>The <I>CDocument::DeleteContents</I> Function</H1></A><P>At some point, you'll need a function to delete the contents of your document. You could write your own private member function, but it happens that the application framework declares a virtual <I>DeleteContents</I> function for the <I>CDocument</I> class. The application framework calls your overridden <I>DeleteContents</I> function when the document is closed and as you'll see in the next chapter, at other times as well.

<A NAME="318"><H1>The <I>CObject</I> Class</H1></A><P>If you study the MFC library hierarchy, you'll notice that the <I>CObject</I> class is at the top. Most other classes are derived from the <I>CObject</I> <U>root</U> class. When a class is derived from <I>CObject</I>, it inherits a number of important characteristics. The many benefits of <I>CObject</I> derivation will become clear as you read 
the chapters that follow.
<P>In this chapter, you'll see how <I>CObject</I> derivation allows objects to 
participate in the diagnostic dumping scheme and allows objects to be elements 
in the collection classes.

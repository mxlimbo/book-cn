<A NAME="922"><H1>IIS Alternatives</H1></A><P>The exercises in this chapter assume that you have Windows NT Server 4.0 
and IIS. If you are running Windows NT Workstation, you can use Peer Web 
Services, which supports fewer connections and doesn't allow virtual servers. If 
you are running Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows 98, you can use Personal 
Web Server, which is packaged with Microsoft FrontPage. Internet 
Information Server, Peer Web Services, and Personal Web Server can all use ISAPI 
extension DLLs. See your server's documentation for operating details.

<H1>Preface</H1>

<P>As this book goes to press, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems find themselves in litigation over the future development of Microsoft Visual J++. In an interim ruling, the judge in this case has decided that Microsoft must make changes to the Visual J++ 6 programming language. Although Microsoft is contesting this decision, it is complying with the court's ruling in the version of Visual J++ 6 found on this book's CD.</P>

<P>Link to <A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualj/lawsuitruling.asp" TARGET="window_2">http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualj/lawsuitruling.asp</A> to learn more about this litigation and other decisions stemming from this trial.</P>

<H2>Impact on Visual J++ 6</H2>

<P>Most of the changes directed by the court to date have no affect on the text or the code contained within this book. Two changes are significant enough to warrant explanation.</P>

<H3>Making Some Visual J++ 6 Extensions to Java Optional</H3>

<P>Visual J++ 6 introduces several features that aren't found in Sun Microsystems' version of Java. The court has required that these extensions be disabled by default and be enabled only at the programmer's request.</P>

<P>An option on the Compile tab of the Project Properties dialog box, Disable Microsoft Language Extensions, has been turned on by default. The reader must clear this option to enable the Microsoft extensions in order for many of the programs in this book to compile and execute properly.</P>

<P> In addition, when creating new projects that use the Windows Foundations Classes for Java, such as a Microsoft Windows Application or a COM DLL, the Visual J++ 6 Wizard displays a dialog box warning you that your project requires Microsoft language extensions to operate successfully. You must click the Yes button to enable the extensions. Clicking Yes clears the Disable Microsoft Language Extensions option on the Project Properties dialog box. (After clicking Yes, you'll be warned that your compiled code will run only on Windows operating systems with the Microsoft Virtual Machine for Java installed.)</P>

<P>It is not necessary to enable Microsoft Language Extensions when creating the generic applications and applets described in Part I and at the beginning of Part II.</P>

<H3>The Java Native Interface</H3>

<P>Version 1.0 of the Java language did not include access to functions written in native assembly language. After Microsoft had already defined a Java interface to native code called the Raw Native Interface (RNI), Sun Microsystems introduced the Java Native Interface (JNI) in Version 1.1 of Java.</P>

<P>Visual J++ 6 adds a greatly improved Java interface to native code called J/Direct. J/Direct provides point and shoot access to the entire Microsoft Win32 API. In addition, J/Direct provides easy access to any code resident in a dynamic-link library
(DLL), including DLLs written by the application programmer. As easy as it is to use, J/Direct suffers from two flaws in the opinion of the court: it is Windows-specific and it isn't supported in generic Java.</P>

<P>The new version of Visual J++ 6 includes support for JNI as well as J/Direct.</P>

<H2>Impact on You, the Reader</H2>

<P>The most recent version of Visual J++ 6 can be found as a Trial Edition on this book's companion CD.</P>

<P>Additional information that you will need in order to make effective use of the two changes discussed here, and any future additions to the Visual J++ product as
a result of court rulings, can be found in the Reader's Corner at this address: </P>

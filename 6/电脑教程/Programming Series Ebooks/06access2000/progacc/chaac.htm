<A NAME="449"><H1>FMS</H1></A>

<P>The FMS (www.fmsinc.com) product demos address a broad range of 
developer-oriented topics, from custom ActiveX controls to maintaining Access 
databases. Most demos explicitly target Access developers. Many Visual Basic 
developers also use Microsoft Jet as a database engine for their custom solutions. Two 
of the FMS demos explicitly target Visual Basic development issues.</P>

<A NAME="450"><H2>Total Access Agent</H2></A>

<P>For optimal performance and stability, Access/Jet (.mdb) databases must 
be periodically repaired, compacted, backed up, and monitored. Total Access 
Agent schedules and automatically performs these tasks across multiple databases. 
You can perform these tasks at night or even back up data while users are 
working in the database. Total Access Agent can manage multiple databases across 
any network that supports Access&#8212;it even handles secured databases and lets 
you assign security workgroups, user names, and passwords. Total Access Agent 
lets you create hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly events, and you can even 
specify when processing should finish. Every task performed by Total Access Agent 
is recorded in Access tables with customizable reports. If any problems (such 
as corruption) occur, the error is recorded and the system administrator can 
be notified by e-mail.</P>

<A NAME="451"><H2>Total Access Analyzer</H2></A>

<P>Total Access Analyzer offers complete documentation, cross-referencing, 
error detection, enhancement suggestions, and reporting on your Access 
databases. You can generate complete documentation of tables, fields, indexes, 
relationships, forms, controls, reports, command bars, hyperlinks, macros, and modules. 
You select the objects and analysis to perform, and then you can view the 
results and use any of the more than 225 presentation reports. All of the output is 
stored in Access tables. You can query and sort the results or create your own reports.</P>

<A NAME="452"><H2>Total Access Components</H2></A>

<P>Total Access Components is the only collection of ActiveX controls 
specifically designed and tested for Access. It includes 27 ActiveX controls, which you 
can place on your forms and reports. Many controls provide new and 
enhanced display effects, while others let you use properties and methods to perform 
complex operations with little or no programming. You can modify most 
properties programmatically and invoke methods on some of the controls for 
additional functionality.</P>

<A NAME="453"><H2>Total Access Memo</H2></A>

<P>Total Access Memo lets Access users and developers add formatted memo 
fields to forms and reports. You can enhance your applications by adding support 
for features such as fonts, point sizes, boldface, italics, underline, bullet 
points, paragraph alignment, and tab stops. You can add the Total Access 
Memo<B> </B>control to your form or report and bind it to a memo field. You press Shift+F2 
on the field to launch the FMS Rich Text Formatting (RTF) editor, and when 
you finish, it is automatically saved in your table and displayed on your form. 
You can save and maintain both an RTF and a nonformatted (text-only) memo 
field. You can even import text files in RTF format, export the current field to an 
RTF file, or export to a text-only file. The RTF editor lets you easily enter text 
and apply the styles you want. It also includes features such as Find, Search 
&amp; Replace, and Spell Checking.</P>

<A NAME="454"><H2>Total Access Statistics</H2></A>

<P>Total Access Statistics offers a wide range of statistical functions for Access 
users and developers. It eliminates the need to export your data to other 
programs for statistical analysis. It is installed as an Access add-in and runs directly 
from your database through the File-Add-Ins menu. Using the Total Access 
Statistics wizard, you can quickly analyze your data without programming. You can 
analyze any Access table, linked table, or select query. You can analyze an 
unlimited number of records and multiple fields at one time. Best of all, the 
results are kept in Access tables. You can view, sort, or query the results, merge it 
with other data, or add it to forms and reports. You can also add Total Access 
Statistics to your Access applications. If you are a developer and need statistical 
analysis in your database, you can bypass the wizard and add all the statistical 
features directly to your application with a simple procedure call.</P>

<A NAME="455"><H2>Total VB Statistics</H2></A>

<P>Total VB Statistics offers a wide range of statistical functions for Visual 
Basic programmers who use Jet databases. It eliminates the need to export your 
data to other programs for statistical analysis. You can perform a wide range of 
statistical functions; all results are kept in Access tables. You can view, sort, 
query, or display the results. You can also add them to reports. Total VB 
Statistics has two parts: The interactive Statistics Scenario Designer, a standalone 
program, lets you specify the database, data, fields, and analysis to perform; 
the ActiveX DLL component performs the analysis. This DLL file, which is less 
than 1 MB, is the only file you need to include with your VB applications to 
add statistical analysis.</P>

<A NAME="456"><H2>Total VB SourceBook</H2></A>

<P>Total VB SourceBook is an extensive source code library for Visual Basic, 
with over 60,000 lines of code and more than 1700 procedures that you can 
add directly to your applications. It includes more than 100 classes and 
modules covering 27 major categories of Visual Basic application development. Each 
class and module is independent, so you can add one without others. Select the 
code you want from the FMS Code Explorer and insert it directly into your 
project. You can even add your own code so that all your important code is in 
one convenient place.</P>

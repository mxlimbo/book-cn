<H1>Dedication</H1>

<p><I>When I was a kid, one popular song was &quot;This Is Dedicated to 
the One I Love.&quot; That song title really fits my purpose in 
this section. The one person on earth that I love the most is my 
wife, Virginia, and this book is dedicated to her. Without her 
support, encouragement, and help, you would be reading a 
different book&#8212;maybe by a different author.</I></p>

<p><I>Virginia was a major force behind the book from the 
beginning. When Ben Ryan from Microsoft Press 
approached me to write a book, Virginia urged me to say yes. When the time frame 
for completing chapters collapsed into a shorter than expected 
period, it was Virginia who stepped into the gap to relieve me of all 
household responsibilities. She also supported me as I worked 
long hours to complete the book. When I needed an extra pair of eyes 
to proofread chapters before submitting them to Microsoft 
Press, Virginia rose to the occasion again. Finally, when 
I gave all that I could to the book but felt that still more was 
required, it was Virginia who said a prayer to remind me that I can do all 
things through Christ, who strengthens me.</I></p>

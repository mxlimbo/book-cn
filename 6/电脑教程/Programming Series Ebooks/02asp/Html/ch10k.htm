<H1>Part IV: Preparing to Use MTS with IIS</H1>
<H2>
<B>Step 1</B>
</H2>
<P>Before you can use MTS with Internet Information Server, you have to 
change an IIS registry setting to allow IIS to handle out-of-process ActiveX components.
<P><HR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>NOTE:</b> Making incorrect changes to the system registry can 
result in serious problems. Make the following changes carefully!
</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>
<P>Changes to the IIS system registry are made through the registry 
editor. Start the editor by running Regedit from the command line in Windows.<P>
Inside the registry, locate the following entry:
<PRE WIDTH="0">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM
\CurrentControlSet
&#160;\Services
&#160;&#160;\W3SVC
&#160;&#160;&#160;\ASP
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\Parameters
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\AllowOutOfProcCmpnts
</PRE>
<P>The AllowOutOfProcCmpnts key is normally set to 0, which prevents 
IIS from using out-of-process components such as those in MTS. Double-click 
this key, and change its value to 1. This allows IIS to work with components in MTS.

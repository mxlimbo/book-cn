<H1>An E-Mail Information System</H1>
<P>This project creates an e-mail information system that allows users to 
receive e-mail containing detailed information about products and services 
available from your Web site. The system is similar to the old &quot;fax back&quot; systems, 
which returned product information to users via a fax machine. At the core of 
the project is the creation of an ActiveX component that is capable of 
sending e-mail. The component is written in Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0. This project 
does not teach Visual Basic but is designed to show programmers familiar with 
Visual Basic 5.0 how to use that knowledge with Visual InterDev.

<P>When you create scripts for both Internet Explorer version 4.0 and 
Netscape Navigator version 3.0, you will encounter differences in object models and 
case sensitivity. Like IE 4.0, Navigator has an object model. In fact, the two 
object models share many of the same base objects, including Window and 
Document; but the Netscape objects might have only a subset of the properties and 
methods found in IE 4.0.<P>
Case sensitivity for object names in Internet Explorer is not a major 
concern when you use VBScript as your scripting language. However, 
Netscape Navigator and JavaScript are both case sensitive. This 
means that if you address the Window object in JavaScript, Navigator expects 
the <I>W </I>to be lowercase. Window with a 
capital <I>W </I>is not understood by Navigator. This book follows 
the convention that major words in objects are initial capped (e.g., Window, 
Document, Frames) because the text is more readable, but you can use all 
lowercase if you prefer.

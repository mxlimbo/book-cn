<P>Dynamic HTML provides the primary client-side programming tool 
for Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0. But Dynamic HTML is not supported 
by browsers such as Netscape Navigator. In fact, very little of the client-side 
functionality supported by various browsers can be considered truly cross-platform.
<P>If you want to design an Internet site accessible to a number of 
different browsers, you need to move the programming from the client to the 
server. Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) allows you to create server-side 
applications that can be used by a variety of browsers. ASP is essentially nothing 
more than VBScript that runs on the server. The script code generates HTML 
when a page is requested. That is the key to ASP: a client never sees your 
code&#151;only the resulting HTML, which can be recognized by any browser.

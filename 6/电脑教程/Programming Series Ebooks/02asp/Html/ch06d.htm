<H1>Part II: Creating the Home Page</h1>
<P>In this part, you will create a home page for the bookstore. Before you 
begin, however, you must add some graphics files to your site. 
<P>


<H2>Step 1</h2>
<P>If you don't already have the Bookstore web open in Visual InterDev, 
open it now. Click the IMAGES directory, and choose Add To Project/Files 
from the Project menu. Navigate the \CODE\CHAP06\IMAGES directory to find the following files, and add them to your project:
<P>BANNER.GIF
<P>HOTLIST.GIF
<P>ORDER.GIF
<P>SEARCH.GIF


<P><H2>Step 2</h2>
<P>To add a new Web page to your project, choose New from the File menu. 
When the New dialog box appears, click the Files tab and then click HTML Page. 
In the File Name box, type <I>DEFAULT.HTM</I>, and click OK. Visual InterDev 
will automatically add the new Web page to your site.

<B>Key Point</B>
<P>While Internet Information Server is not case sensitive, other 
servers (UNIX, for example) do distinguish between names such as 
DEFAULT.HTM and default.htm.
</blockquote><HR>


<P><H2>Step 3</h2>
<P>Visual InterDev ships with a special edition of Microsoft FrontPage, a 
graphical editing tool for creating Web pages. You will use this tool to create a 
simple home page for the Bookstore site. The page will consist of some text, 
graphics, and links to other pages.
<P>Right-click DEFAULT.HTM, and choose Open With from the 
pop-up menu. In the Open With dialog box, open the file with Microsoft 
FrontPage Editor. FrontPage should present a blank Web page.
<P>Start by adding a banner to the top of the home page welcoming 
people to the site. In FrontPage, you can add an image to the site by choosing 
Image from the Insert menu. In the Image dialog box, choose to insert an image by 
 specifying the location of the image in the From Location text box:
<P><PRE>/BOOKSTORE/IMAGES/BANNER.GIF</pre>
<P>Click the OK button, and the banner will appear on the page. Center 
the banner by clicking the Center button on the toolbar.
<P><HR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>WARNING:</b> Graphics do not always display properly in 
Microsoft FrontPage, even when you have specified a legitimate file 
location. This is normally not a problem, and the graphics will appear in 
the final page under Internet Explorer.
</blockquote><HR>
<P>At this point, your home page has a black-and-white image on a 
gray background&#151;not very attractive. You can easily change the background 
color by choosing Background from the Format menu. In the Page Properties 
dialog box, list boxes present color selections for the background and text. 
Change the background color to white, and click the OK button.
<P>Save your work by choosing Save from the File menu.


<P><H2>Step 4</h2>
<P>Start a new line by pressing the Enter key on your keyboard&#151;the same as 
you would do with any word processor. Left-justify this line by clicking the 
Left button on the toolbar.
<P>Now add some simple text, and turn the text into a hyperlink. This 
link will allow the user to access the full-text search capabilities of the site. 
Type <I>Search This Site</I>, highlight all the text you typed, and select the Arial font 
from the font formatting toolbar. Keep the text highlighted, and add a link to 
the full-text search page by choosing Hyperlink from the Insert menu. In 
the Hyperlink dialog box, type <I>SEARCH.HTM </I>in the URL text box and click 
OK. This will link the text to the search page. Save your work.
<P>Your home page should now look like the example in Figure 6-4.


<P><H2>Step 5</h2>
<P>Right-click the new link you created, and choose Follow Hyperlink from 
the pop-up menu. The full-text search page that was generated by the Web 
Project wizard at the beginning of the exercise will be loaded into FrontPage. 
Using the techniques introduced in this exercise, change the background color 
of the page to white and customize the generic text to fit the Bookstore 
home page. Be careful not to change the text boxes or buttons in any way.

<P><H2>Step 6</h2>
<P>After you save all your changes, close FrontPage Editor and return to 
Visual InterDev. Browse your new site by selecting DEFAULT.HTM and 
choosing Preview In Browser from the File menu. Try out the hyperlink and 
full-text search capabilities.

<P>In an early effort to increase the interactivity of HTML Web pages, some 
developers turned to <I>scripting,</I> adding code-based functionality by combining 
a programming language with HTML. This approach often results in a 
strange hybrid of code and tags that once again takes developers back to the text 
editor. In scripting, the &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tag is introduced to define a code section in 
the Web page. Listing&#160;1-3 uses VBScript to create a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; example, 
as shown in Figure&#160;1-3.

<I>&quot;Hello, World!&quot; created using VBScript.</I><P>
VBScript is a scripting language based on Microsoft's popular Visual 
Basic for Applications (VBA), a language found in products such as 
Microsoft's Office 97. VBScript is not a complete version of VBA but rather a subset 
that keeps many of the key features of VBA while removing features that 
might make the language unnecessarily bulky or unsafe. For example, VBScript 
does not support data types&#151;every variable defined is a Variant.<P>
Like its big brother, VBA, VBScript is an event-driven language. 
This means that the code you write is executed in response to an 
<I>event,</I> a user interaction with a graphical user interface, or GUI. For our purposes, the 
GUI is the Web page. So, in the example above, when the user interacts with the 
GUI by clicking the Click Me! button, the action fires the OnClick event. 
This event is mapped to the VBScript code by way of an event-handling 
subroutine. A subroutine is named 
<I>ControlName</I>_<I>EventName</I> for any control and 
event combination. The only caveat here is that some events can also be 
generated by the browser itself. For example, when a Web page completes a load into 
the browser, the Window_OnLoad event fires, independent of any user 
interaction with the page.<P>
Although scripting represents an advancement in interactivity, it has 
its limitations. For example, not all browsers recognize scripting. Among 
those that do,<B> </B>not all use the same language. Chief among these is Netscape 
Navigator&#160;3.0, which does not recognize VBScript but instead recognizes 
JavaScript, a scripting language originally created for Netscape Navigator. JavaScript 
is similar in function to VBScript but is very different in syntax. Unlike 
VBScript, JavaScript does not support the concept of an event-handling subroutine. 
All routines in JavaScript are functions, which are called by virtue of event 
attributes that reside in the HTML tag. Listing&#160;1-4 is the JavaScript version 
of the previous VBScript example.

<P>Not only does support for scripting vary by browser, but scripting does 
not provide the mature functionality programmers expect in a language. 
Scripting offers a subset of the language features developers normally use, a 
subset that limits structures and operators to fundamental looping and 
decision making. In fact, scripting alone is generally useful only for performing 
client-side data validation prior to submitting the form to a server.<P>
Once scripting is added to the mix, platform complications 
abound. Obviously, if a scripting language is not universal, it cannot be 
adequately deployed on the Internet, and consequently all of the advertised 
advantages of platform independence on the Web come to nothing. For many 
Webmasters and developers, the constant battle between browsers for market share 
has resulted in the need to maintain three versions of each Web site: one 
for Microsoft Internet Explorer, one for Netscape Navigator, and one for old 
browsers such as Mosaic that can't understand any of the new technology.

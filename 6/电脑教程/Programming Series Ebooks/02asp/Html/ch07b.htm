<OL>
<LI>Microsoft Visual InterDev 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 or later (or Microsoft 
Personal Web Server) with Active Server Pages installed
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0
<LI>Remote Data Services installed on the server
<LI>Catalog project files
</ol>
<P>This project makes extensive use of Remote Data Services (RDS) for 
accessing ODBC data sources on the Web server. You must have RDS 
installed on the Windows NT server where you have installed Internet 
Information Server. The server portion of RDS is included on the CD-ROM that 
accompanies this book. The client portion of RDS (known as the Advanced 
Data Control) ships with Internet Explorer 4.0 and does not require any 
additional installation.
<P>This project was created using the Preview 2 version of IE 4.0. As a 
result, some parts of the exercise might require minor modifications to 
accommodate the final release of IE 4.0. In particular, you should be careful to 
note the CLSID attributes of the &lt;OBJECT&gt; tags in the code. Quite often 
CLSID attributes change between the preview and final release of a product. In 
most cases, any required changes should be minor.
<P>The database used by the online catalog is named HOME.MDB and is a Microsoft 
Access database. You will need to copy this file to the server where your 
RDS components can access the data. Later in the project, you will set up an 
ODBC data source for the database.

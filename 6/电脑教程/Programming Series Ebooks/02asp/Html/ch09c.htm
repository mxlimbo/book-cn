<H1>Part I: Learning the SMTP Protocol</H1>
<P>Before you can create the E-mail component in this project, you must 
understand a little about the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) used to send 
mail on the Internet. SMTP is a clear text protocol that functions through a 
series of commands and responses exchanged between the e-mail client and 
server. Before automating the process, investigate this protocol by sending 
e-mail manually, using an application named Telnet.
<P><HR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>NOTE:</b> You will need direct access to an SMTP server. This 
project assumes that you are using Exchange 5.0 as your Internet mail 
server. Other servers might function slightly differently.
</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>
<P>Sending e-mail does not require a complicated piece of client 
software. In fact, every computer running Microsoft Windows has a built-in network 
client, Telnet, which allows you to interact with a server by typing in commands.
<H2>
<B>Step 1</B>
</H2>
<P>Start Telnet by choosing Run from the Start menu and typing the 
command <I>Telnet</I>. The Telnet application window appears, as shown in Figure 9-1.

<I>The Telnet application.</I>
<P>Once Telnet is started, connect to your e-mail server by choosing 
Remote System from the Connect menu. In the Connect dialog box, provide the 
following information:
<P>Host Name: <I>[Your Server IP Address]</I><P>
Port: 25
<P>Click the Connect button. After a few moments, the server should 
respond with this message:
<P>220 <I>[Your Server Name]</I> Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail 
Service 5.0.1457
<H2>
<B>Step 2</B>
</H2>
<P>You are now communicating with the server. To see your instructions to 
the server, choose Preferences from the Terminal menu. In the Terminal 
Preferences dialog box, check the Local Echo option and click OK.
<H2>
<B>Step 3</B>
</H2>
<P>Begin your e-mail transmission by typing the e-mail address of the sender 
and pressing enter:
<P>MAIL FROM: <I>[Sender's E-Mail Address]</I>{ENTER}
<P>The server should respond:
<P>250 OK - mail from &lt;<I>[Sender's E-Mail 
Address]</I>&gt;
<H2>
<B>Step 4</B>
</H2>
<P>Type the recipient's address, and press enter:
<P>RCPT TO: <I>[Recipient's E-Mail Address]</I>{ENTER}
<P>The server should respond:
<P>250 OK - Recipient &lt;<I>[Recipient's E-Mail 
Address]</I>&gt;
<H2>
<B>Step 5</B>
</H2>
<P>To tell the server that you are ready to send the body of your message, type 
the following:
<P>DATA{ENTER}
<P>The server should respond:
<P>354 Send Data. End with CRLF.CRLF
<H2>
<B>Step 6</B>
</H2>
<P>Type the body of your message line by line with a carriage return at the 
end of each line. The server recognizes that your message is complete when 
you send a period on a line by itself.
<P>For example, to send a test message, type the following into Telnet:
<P>DATE: <I>[Today's Date in dd/mm/yy Format]</I>{ENTER}<P>
FROM: <I>[Sender's Name]</I>{ENTER}<P>
TO: <I>[Recipient's Name]</I>{ENTER}<P>
SUBJECT: Telnet Test!{ENTER}<P>
{ENTER}<P>
This is an e-mail test from Telnet!{ENTER}<P>
.{ENTER}
<P>Don't forget the period on the last line. The server will respond with 
the following:
<P>250 OK
<H2>
<B>Step 7</B>
</H2>
<P>Your message has been sent. Close Telnet by choosing Disconnect and then 
Exit from the Connect menu.
<H2>
<B>Step 8</B>
</H2>
<P>Open your e-mail package, and check for your message!

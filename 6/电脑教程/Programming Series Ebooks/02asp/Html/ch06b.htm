<OL>
<LI>Microsoft Visual InterDev 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 (or Microsoft 
Personal Web Server) with Active Server Pages installed
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0
<LI>Remote Data Services (RDO) installed on the server
<LI>Microsoft Agent control
<LI>Bookstore project files
</ol>
<P>Completing this exercise depends on the correct setup of the 
Microsoft Agent control. Although Internet Explorer 4.0 ships with the final version 
of the Agent control, this exercise was created with the beta 3 version of 
the control. This means that you should not install the Agent control that ships 
with IE 4.0, but rather install the beta 3 version from the CD-ROM that accompanies this book.
<P>As an alternative, you can examine the documentation for the IE 
4.0 Agent control and determine whether the code in this exercise is 
acceptable. You might also choose to modify some of the code where appropriate.

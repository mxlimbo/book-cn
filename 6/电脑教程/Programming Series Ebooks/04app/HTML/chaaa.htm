<p>To build the sample applications in this book, you must deal with
compiler and linker switch settings. I have tried to isolate these
details from the sample applications by putting almost all of these
settings in a single header file, called CmnHdr.h, which is included in
all of the sample application source code files.</p>

<p>Since I wasn't able to put all of the settings in this header
file, I made some changes to each sample application's project
settings. For each project, I displayed the Project Settings dialog box
and then made the following changes:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>On the General tab, I set the Output Files directory so that all
final .exe and .dll files go to a single directory.</li></p>

<p><li>On the C/C++ tab, I selected the Code Generation category and
selected Multithreaded DLL for the Use Run-Time Library field.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>That's it. These are the only two settings that I explicitly
changed; I accepted the default settings for everything else. Note that
I made the two changes above for both the Debug and Release builds of
each project. I was able to set all other compiler and linker settings
in the source code, so these settings will be in effect if you use any
of my source code modules in your projects.</p>

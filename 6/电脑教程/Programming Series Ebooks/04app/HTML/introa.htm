<P>Microsoft Windows is a complex operating system. It 
offers so many features and does so much that it's impossible 
for any one person to fully understand the entire system. 
This complexity also makes it difficult for someone to decide 
where to start concentrating the learning effort. Well, I 
always like to start at the lowest level by gaining a solid 
understanding of the system's basic building blocks. Once 
you understand the basics, it's easy to incrementally add 
any higher-level aspects of the system to your knowledge.</P> 

<P>For example, I don't explicitly discuss the Component Object 
Model (COM) in this book. But COM is an architecture built using processes, 
threads, memory management, DLLs, thread local storage, Unicode, and so on. If 
you know these basic building blocks, understanding COM is just a matter 
of understanding how the building blocks are used. I have great sympathy 
for people who attempt to jump-start into learning COM's architecture. They 
have a long road ahead and are bound to have gaping holes in their knowledge, 
which is bound to negatively affect their code and their schedules.</P>

<P>So that's what this book is all about: the basic Windows building 
blocks that every Windows developer (at least in my opinion) should be intimately 
aware of. As each block is discussed, I also describe how the system uses these 
blocks and how your own applications can best take advantage of these blocks. In 
many chapters, I show you how to create building blocks of your own. These 
building blocks, typically implemented as generic functions or C++ classes, group 
a set of Windows building blocks together to create a whole that is much 
greater than the sum of its parts.</P>

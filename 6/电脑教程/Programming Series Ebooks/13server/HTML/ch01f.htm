<A NAME="8"><h1>Why Develop a Service?</h1></A>

<p>When designing your server application, you can implement it as a 
simple Windows executable in the same way you would implement any 
application. However, Windows supports a special type of application named a 
<i>service</i>. A service is a normal Windows executable application that contains 
additional infrastructure. This additional infrastructure allows the executable 
application to be controlled and monitored using the Service Control Manager (a 
component built into every machine running Windows).</p>


<p>The SCM allows an administrator to start, stop, pause, and continue 
a service executable locally or remotely. The SCM also monitors the service 
and can automatically restart it or reboot the machine if the service terminates 
unexpectedly. All server applications that ship with Windows are implemented 
as services. The MMC provides a Services snap-in that allows an administrator 
to control all the installed services by using a common interface.</p>


<p>For all these reasons, I strongly suggest that you include the 
additional infrastructure code in your application to turn it into a service. The details 
of how to do this are described in <A HREF="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</A> of this book. The standard 
interface that allows you to control the SCM is described in <A HREF="ch04a.htm">Chapter 4</A>.</p>

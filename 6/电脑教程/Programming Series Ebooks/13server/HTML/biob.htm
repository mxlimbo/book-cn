<p>Jason D. Clark is an accomplished Microsoft Windows developer and consultant. His specialties are base-services programming and developing software that takes full advantage of the security features in Windows. Jason frequently writes articles in publications such as 	<i>Microsoft System Journal, Dr. Dobb's Journal,</i> and <i>Windows Developer's Journal</i>. He makes regular contributions to the Dr. GUI column of MSDN as well as to the Microsoft Knowledge Base. In addition to publishing texts on software development for the Windows operating system, Jason occasionally speaks on topics in his area of expertise at developer conferences.</p>

<p>Jason has been writing software for Windows operating systems for nine years, seven of which he spent as a software developer/consultant in California. Some of his major clients included IBM, Seiko, Sony, and First American Mortgage. During those years, Jason's interest in Windows software development became a passion, and he accepted a job with Microsoft in 1997.</p>

<p>Jason now lives in Seattle where he enjoys the intriguing and unique culture of one of Washington's finest cities. You can frequently find him enjoying a sushi dinner with his wife, after which he may retire to one of Seattle's many microbreweries and enjoy a beer.</p>

<A NAME="6"><h1>Administration</h1></A>

<p>Different organizations have different needs. Software developers try to 
meet these needs by designing systems and application software that expose 
myriad configuration settings. These multiple options overwhelm most users and 
system administrators. The problem is compounded by the fact that most systems 
consist of many computers networked together. In addition, the person with the 
expertise to configure a machine is usually not physically sitting in front of 
it, causing that machine to have prolonged downtime.</p>


<p>Server applications in particular usually run on computers that live in 
rooms that are basically closets, so your server software should be capable of 
being remotely administered. In other words, an administrator should be able to 
have one machine start and stop the execution of your service while she sits at 
another machine. The administrator should also be able to configure your 
server's numerous settings remotely.</p>


<p>From a server's perspective, your service might need to 
communicate information to the administrator. For example, you might want your server 
to report the number of clients connected and the amount of time required 
to process the average client request. Your server might also need to report 
exceptional events such as low disk space or an attempted security breach.</p>


<p>Microsoft has added a lot of infrastructure to Windows to make 
remote administration easy. The Service Control Manager (or SCM, 
pronounced &quot;scum&quot;) can control a service's execution. The registry is used for storing 
a server's configuration settings. The performance-monitoring facility allows 
a server to report run-time statistics, and the event log database allows a 
server to notify an administrator of exceptional events. All these facilities have 
programmatic interfaces and can be accessed remotely. The proper use of these 
facilities will make an administrator's life easier. Each facility is discussed in this book.</p>


<p>The Microsoft Management Console (MMC) is a tool implemented 
in MMC.exe that provides one-stop shopping for the system administrator. 
It integrates access into the various components of the system, including 
installed services. You should also be able to configure your service via the MMC.</p>

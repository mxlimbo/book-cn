<A NAME="88"><H1>Multitiered, Replicated, Secure Forms Library</H1></A>

<P>Locating new applications in an organization can be a hard thing to do 
because they exist in so many places. For example, an application can exist on one of 
many possible file servers. Although the emergence of intranets has enhanced the 
ability to find applications, you still have to find the site with explicit links to the 
information you want. And if you do find the web server that has the 
application, you might have to connect to a server halfway around the globe, making 
connection speeds to that application very slow.</p>

<P>Exchange Server's multitiered, replicated, secure forms library makes 
it easier to locate applications. The Exchange Server forms library is divided 
into four main components: an Organizational Forms Library, a 
folder forms library, a Personal Forms Library, and a web forms library. Some of these libraries 
can be synchronized offline, so users can work with the applications, even when 
the users are disconnected from the network. You can choose which of these is 
best for your application.</p>

<P><DIV CLASS="NOTE"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE</B><HR>The web forms library has not yet been given an 
official name. However, web forms library is the name that I will be 
using throughout the book when referring to it.
</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></P>

<A NAME="89"><H2>Organizational Forms Library</H2></A>

<P>The Organizational Forms Library contains, most often, forms that 
everyone in an organization needs access to, such as vacation requests, business cards, 
and travel expense reports. The Organizational Forms Library is contained on 
the Exchange Server and can be replicated to servers throughout your network, 
so access to these forms is fast. It lists all the available applications throughout 
an organization. Figure 3-18 shows an Organizational Forms Library in 
Microsoft Outlook 98.</p>

</P><P>
<!-- CAPTION --><B>Figure 3-18</B> <I>You can publish your application in the Organizational Forms Library, and it will automatically be available to your users.</I><!-- /CAPTION -->
</p>

<P>The Organizational Forms Library is secure, so administrators can set 
which users have permissions to publish or edit information in the forms library. It 
is also multilingual; the Exchange Server presents the server-based forms 
library that corresponds to the language of the client program accessing the 
forms library. For example, when a Japanese client requests a list of forms in the 
Organizational Forms Library, the Exchange Server displays all the 
corresponding Japanese forms. This multilingual capability allows you to customize and 
deploy your applications to the correct client without writing any code.</p>

<A NAME="90"><H2>Folder Forms Library</H2></A>

<P>The folder forms library is for folder-specific forms. The folder forms library 
is more secure than the Organizational Forms Library. You would post forms 
you do not want to share globally in the folder forms library. The forms stored in 
a <I>personal</I> folder forms library are shared only with the users to whom you 
give access. The forms stored in a <I>public</I> folder forms library can be shared with 
any user who has the correct permission on that public folder. Using the 
synchronization capabilities of Exchange Server, users can replicate public folders 
(including their data and forms) offline.</p>

<A NAME="91"><H2>Personal Forms Library</H2></A>

<P>The Personal Forms Library is the most restrictive in terms of sharing its 
forms with other users; this library &quot;belongs&quot; to a particular user and cannot be 
shared with any other user in the organization. All forms in the Personal Forms 
Library can be used both on and off the network. Users can test forms in the 
Personal Forms Library before publishing them to the Organizational Forms Library 
or folder forms library.</p>

<A NAME="92"><H2>Web Forms Library</H2></A>

<P>The web forms library is a hierarchy of folders stored in the Windows NT 
file system where your web server, IIS, runs Outlook Web Access. Exchange 
Server supports HTML forms as a development environment, so Outlook Web 
Access has an easy and automatic way for web developers to publish custom 
forms in the web forms library. To create an HTML-based application, you need 
only to create a subdirectory in the file system where Outlook Web Access is 
stored and copy your HTML files to it. The new form will appear in the 
Launch Custom Forms window of Outlook Web Access. Users can 
then start working with the application from the web forms library. Figure 3-19 shows forms in the web forms library.</p>

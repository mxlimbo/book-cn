<A NAME="105"> <H1>Folders</H1></A>

<P>Folders are the focal point for any Outlook application. They hold data; 
views for that data; and forms, agents, and rules. They provide users with a 
storage location for information and a hierarchy structure that makes finding 
information easy.</p>

<P>In Outlook, you can create folders in three places: in your mailbox 
stored on the Microsoft Exchange Server, in your personal folders stored on 
your computer's hard disk, and in public folders. Each of these locations has 
advantages and disadvantages. For example, if you create a new folder in your 
personal folders, you cannot easily share it with other users in your 
organization. In addition, you cannot set permissions on it. (In this book, we use public 
folders for storing application data.) Many of the properties you can set on 
public folders are applicable to the other two types of folders.</p>

<P><DIV CLASS="NOTE"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE</B><HR>
Some of the steps and figures in this chapter are based 
on a user having permissions to create public folders. If you can 
right-click on a public folder and choose New Folder, you have 
permission to create a subfolder. If you are unable to create a public folder, 
contact your Exchange Server administrator to see whether a 
public folder is available to you that will allow you to create folders. If 
no public folder is available to you, ask your Exchange 
Server administrator for the proper permission.
</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></P>

<A NAME="106"><H2>Creating Public Folders</H2></A>

<P>To help you work through the rest of the chapter, we are going to look at 
three simple applications that use the different building blocks of Microsoft 
Outlook: a threaded discussion application, an account tracking system, and a 
document library application. Each of these applications needs its own separate public 
folder to store its data.</p>

<P>To create a public folder for each application, follow these steps:</p>

<OL>
<P><LI>From the File menu in Outlook 98, select New and then 
Folder. The Create New Folder dialog box appears.</li></p>

<P><LI>In the Name box, type a name for the folder. Start with the 
threaded discussion application, and type <I>Outlook Discussion Group.</I></li></p>

<P><LI>The drop-down list named Folder Contains shows possible 
items. Keep the default, which is Mail Items.</li></p>
</OL>

<P><DIV CLASS="NOTE"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE</B><HR>
Outlook allows you to set the default type of item 
contained in the folder. If you were creating a public folder of task 
items, you would select Task Items from the drop-down menu. The 
folder can hold other types of items besides the default item you select.
</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></P>

<OL>
<P><LI value="4">In the Select Where To Place The Folder box, expand the 
Public Folders tree, select All Public Folders, and then click OK.</li></p>

<P><LI>Outlook might prompt you about whether you want to add a 
shortcut to this folder to your Outlook bar. Click No.</li></p>

<P><LI>Repeat these steps to create an Account Tracking public folder and 
a Document Library public folder.</li></p>
</OL>

<A NAME="107"><H2>Customizing Folder Properties</H2></A>

<P>After creating the folders, you need to customize their properties for your 
application. Outlook automatically creates and sets certain properties of the 
folder for you. For example, Outlook creates common views for a folder based on 
the default type of folder you select. For a calendar folder, Outlook creates 
default calendar views such as day/week/month and active appointments; for a 
contacts folder, Outlook creates default contact views. You can change the 
default properties for a folder in the folder's Properties dialog box: right-click on a 
folder in the folder list, and select Properties from the context menu. The 
properties for the folder appear. Figure 4-1 shows the Properties dialog box for a 
Job Candidates application.</p>

</p>

<A NAME="108"><H3>General Tab</H3></A>

<P>The General tab allows you to modify the general properties of a folder. 
In addition to specifying the folder name and describing the folder, you can do 
the following tasks:</p>

<UL>
<P><LI><I>Specify the default form for posting items to the 
folder.</I> You can set which default or custom form a user should use when 
submitting an item to the folder. As you will see with our sample 
applications, you'll want to modify this property after you develop custom 
forms for the folder.</li></p>

<P><LI><I>Automatically generate Outlook views for users of the Exchange 
client.</I> When the Automatically Generate Microsoft Exchange Views 
check box is checked, Outlook automatically generates all views for 
the folder so that users on the Exchange client can use them. This 
property must be set if you want your custom Outlook views to be 
available in the Outlook Web Access client or to your Collaborative 
Data Objects (CDO) applications. By default, Outlook enables this property.</li></p>

<P><LI><I>Check the size of the folder.</I> Click the Folder Size button to check 
how much space the folder is using to store its items and any 
subfolders. This option can help you figure out which folders are being used 
most frequently by users.</li></p>
</UL>

<A NAME="109"> <H3>Administration Tab</H3></A>

<P>The folder's Administration tab enables you to perform common 
administrative tasks. The following sections describe them.</p>

<UL>
<P><LI><i>Set the initial view for the folder.</I> The initial view can be either a built-in Outlook view or a custom view. Outlook Web Access respects 
this initial view property; when a user browses this folder in Outlook 
Web Access, the view you set will be the initial view.</li></p>

<P><LI><i>Set how Outlook formats items dragged into your 
folder.</I> The Drag/Drop Posting drop-down list has two settings: Move/Copy 
and Forward. Move/Copy specifies that when an item is dragged 
into the folder, the item appears exactly as it appears in its original 
location. The user who drags the item into the folder is 
not indicated, and the person who originally posted the item is retained as the 
owner of the item. The Forward setting, in contrast, identifies the user 
who dragged the item into the folder as the user who forwarded the 
item. Outlook modifies the original text of the item to indicate that 
the item was forwarded.</li></p>

<P><LI><I>Save the folder address to your personal address 
book.</I> Use the Add Folder Address To Personal Address Book button to save a 
folder's address so that you can later preaddress any custom forms that 
you want Outlook to automatically send to the folder. The 
administrator can also expose the folder in the Global Address List. Once this 
is done, the folder appears as just another recipient, which you can 
select in the address fields on your form.</li></p>

<P><LI><I>Set the current availability of the 
folder.</I> By default, the option This Folder Is Available To is set to All Users With Access 
Permissions. While designing your application in a folder, you can set this 
property to Owners Only so that users cannot access the folder. This 
property affects only the current folder, so users still can access and 
continue working with subfolders under the parent folder. When a user 
tries to submit items to the parent folder while you have it disabled, 
Outlook returns the items with a note explaining that the folder and 
its contents are available only to owners at this time. After the 
application is done, you can reset this option so that all users can access 
the folders as long as they have proper permission.</li></p>

<P><LI><I>Create rules for the folder.</I> The Folder Assistant button allows you 
to set rules for the folder. Because these rules can control 
information flow in a public folder and check specific properties of items as 
they are submitted into the folder, the Folder Assistant is important to 
designers of applications. For more information on designing rules, 
see the section titled &quot;<A HREF="ch04b.htm#115">Creating Public Folder Rules</A>&quot; later in this chapter.</li></p>

<P><LI><I>Moderate folder content.</I> The Moderated Folder button gives you access to settings that automatically moderate all the content in 
a folder before a user can post information. You can enable 
moderation on any public folder. For information on how to set up a 
moderated folder, see the section titled &quot;<A HREF="ch04b.htm#114">Setting Up Moderated Folders</A>&quot; later in this chapter.</li></p>

<P><LI><I>Show the folder path.</I> The Folder Path text box shows the 
location of the folder in the public folder hierarchy. Remember this 
property when you are designing an application, because it enables users 
to quickly open a folder without having to search through the 
public folder tree.</li></p>
</UL>

<A NAME="110"> <H3>Forms Tab</H3></A>

<P>On the Forms tab, you can specify which forms are associated with a 
folder. You can also restrict which forms users can post to the folder. Clicking 
the Manage button displays the Forms Manager dialog box, as shown in Figure 
4-2. The Forms Manager allows you to copy custom forms from other folders 
or forms libraries into the current folder. You can also update or delete forms.</p>

<P>

<!-- CAPTION --><B>Figure 4-2</B> <I>The Forms Manager dialog box allows you to modify forms associated with the current folder.</I><!-- /CAPTION -->
</p>

<A NAME="111"><H3>Permissions Tab</H3></A>

<P>The Permissions tab, shown in Figure 4-3, allows you to 
set user and group permissions for your folder and its items so that only those 
features you want your users to access are exposed. To modify these 
permissions, you need to be an owner of the folder. By default, when you create a 
folder, Outlook gives you owner rights. This means you have the full range of 
permissions to create, edit, or delete items in the folder. You can also change 
the permissions of other users in the folder.</p>

<P>When you first open the tab, you see that the default role for users is 
set to Author. This role corresponds to a set of permissions on the folder: users 
have the ability to view the folder, create and open items in it, and delete and 
edit their own items.</p>

<P>To learn how to set permissions for our Document Library and 
Account Tracking applications, follow the next set of steps. We'll limit who can 
create and edit documents in the folder to only users in our division, but we'll 
enable all users to at least read the information in our Document Library.</p>

<P>
<img src="images/f04oh03.GIF" width=367 height=502 border=0>
</P><P>
<!-- CAPTION --><B>Figure 4-3</B> <I>On the Permissions tab of the Properties dialog box, you can add, delete, or modify the permissions that users have on the current folder.</I><!-- /CAPTION -->
</p>

<OL>
<P><LI>In the folder list, right-click on the Document Library folder 
you created earlier and select Properties.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click on the Permissions tab.</li></p>

<P><LI>In the Name box, select Default. In the Permissions area, select 
Reviewer from the Roles drop-down list.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click Add, and select several coworkers from the address list in 
the Add Users dialog box. (Outlook also allows you to select and 
assign permissions to distribution lists. This capability makes it easier to 
set permissions for a large number of users.) When finished, click OK.</li></p>

<P><LI>In the Name box, select one of the names you added in the 
preceding step. In the Roles drop-down list, select Publishing Author. 
This role will allow your coworkers to create, read, and edit their own 
items in the folder. Your Permissions tab should look similar to Figure 4-4.</li></p>
</OL>

<P>Follow the same steps for the Account Tracking application, with 
these exceptions:</p>

<UL>
<P><LI>Set the default permissions to None since we do not want anyone 
in our organization besides sales representatives 
accessing the application.</li></p>

<P><LI>Hide the folder from Default users by unchecking the Folder 
Visible check box. Remember to give your salespeople permission on 
the folder or they won't be able to see it either!</li></p>
</UL>

</p>

<P>Figure 4-5 shows an Outlook user browsing the 
public folder hierarchy. Notice that the Account Tracking folder is not visible to 
this user because he does not have the Folder Visible permission.</p>

<P><div class="sidebar"><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Selecting Individual Permissions vs. Selecting Roles</B>
<P>Outlook provides roles with associated permissions so that you do 
not have to select each permission individually. If you wanted to create 
a custom role, you would select the permissions individually, and 
Outlook would apply these permissions to any type of item in the folder. 
For example, try dragging and dropping some Microsoft Word 
documents into the Document Library folder. Log into Outlook as a different 
user. This user is assigned the default permissions for the folder, meaning 
that all documents in the folder are read-only. Now double-click on one 
of the Word documents. You should see Word open but with 
Read-Only at the top of the document. This is Outlook maintaining the 
permissions you set on the items in the folder, even though the Word document 
is not a default Outlook item type.</p>

<!-- CAPTION --><B>Figure 4-5</B> <I>A user browsing the public folder hierarchy. Since the user does not have permissions to view the Account Tracking folder, the folder does not appear in the hierarchy.</I><!-- /CAPTION -->
</p>

<A NAME="112"><H3>Internet News Tab</H3></A>

<P>On this tab, you can view the Internet newsgroup name of the public 
folder. Exchange Server supports exposing public folders as part of an Internet 
newsgroup hierarchy. For example, we can publish our Outlook Discussion Group as 
an Internet newsgroup named <I>Comp.MyCompany.Discussions</I>. By doing this, 
other corporations can receive, as a newsfeed, our threaded discussions in the 
public folder. On this tab, you can also set whether the public folder should be 
visible to newsreader clients.</p>

<A NAME="113"><H3>Synchronization Tab</H3></A>

<P>As you learned in <A HREF="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</A>, Outlook supports synchronizing folders and 
forms for offline use. Now let's set up two of our applications to handle offline 
synchronization:</p>

<OL>
<P><LI>Enable Outlook for offline access. From the Tools menu, 
select Options. Click on the Mail Services tab. Check the Enable 
Offline Access check box, and click OK.</li></p>

<P><LI>To enable offline synchronization for public folders, add the 
folders to your public folder favorites. Open the folder list in 
Outlook. Expand the Public Folders tree to display Favorites and All 
Public Folders. Drag and drop the Document Library folder and the 
Account Tracking folder into the Favorites folder. Both folders 
should appear in your Favorites folder.</li></p>

<P><LI>Open the Favorites folder. Right-click on the Document 
Library folder and select Properties.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click on the Synchronization tab, and select the When Offline 
Or Online option.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click OK.</li></p>

<P><LI>Repeat Steps 3 through 5 for the Account Tracking folder. Now 
both of these folders are set for offline synchronization. Later in this 
chapter, we will use the Filter option in Outlook to select the items to 
synchronize, based on specific criteria, from the server to our client.</li></p>
</OL>

<A NAME="114"><H2>Setting Up Moderated Folders</H2></A>

<P>One of the most requested features of an application that distributes 
information to many users is the ability to moderate content before it is posted. 
Moderation allows folder owners to decide which content is appropriate for 
the application and to select a group of people who can approve the content, 
and it discourages people from posting random information to the application. 
By using public folders, you can supply this functionality to your users 
without having to write any code yourself. The ability to moderate content is a 
built-in feature of public folders. To show you how moderated public folders work, 
let's enable moderation for the Outlook Discussion Group application. Take a 
look at Figure 4-6 as you follow these steps:</p>

<OL>
<P><LI>Find the Outlook Discussion Group folder you created in the 
public folder list, right-click on it, and select Properties.</li></p>

<P><LI>In the Properties dialog box, click on the Administration tab.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click the Moderated Folder button to open the Moderated 
Folder dialog box.</li></p>

<P><LI>Check the Set Folder Up As A Moderated Folder check box to 
make the discussion folder a moderated folder.</li></p>

<P><LI>In the Forward New Items To box, either type the names of 
people who are moderators or enter the address of another public folder 
to which Outlook should forward the items.</li></p>

<P><LI>Check the Reply To New Items With check box. By enabling 
this option, every user who mails or posts items in the folder will 
receive a reply note from Outlook.</li></p>

<P><LI>Choose Standard Response as the response type. Users 
automatically will receive an e-mail in their Inbox thanking them for their 
submission and explaining that there might be a delay before the 
item is available in the folder due to a pending review by other users.</li></p>
</OL>

<P><DIV CLASS="NOTE"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE</B><HR>
You can also send a custom response.
</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></P>

<OL>
<P><LI value="8">In the Moderators area, click the Add button. Select users or 
distribution lists to be moderators of the content placed in the

When finished, click OK.</li></p>

<P>

<!-- CAPTION --><B>Figure 4-6</B> <I>The Moderated Folder dialog box.</I><!-- /CAPTION -->
</p>

</OL>

<A NAME="115"><H2>Creating Public Folder Rules</H2></A>

<P>Sometimes the built-in moderation features don't provide you with 
enough control over the information flowing into your application. So instead of 
using moderated public folders, you can place custom rules into your 
application. These rules automatically process new items as they arrive.</p>

<P><div class="sidebar">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>More About Moderators and Forwarding Items</B>
<P>Moderators are individual users or distribution lists that are allowed 
to approve content. When a moderator posts an item to a folder, the 
item is not forwarded for review. Instead, the item is left in the folder. If 
the owner of the folder is not listed as a moderator, the item she posts 
to a folder will be forwarded for review. The owner cannot drag and 
drop the item back into the folder; Outlook automatically forwards the 
item for review again until a <I>moderator</I> drags and drops the item back 
into the folder. If you are going to use a moderated folder, add the 
folder owners as moderators.</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></P>

<P>Rules consist of conditions and actions. As you would guess, if the 
conditions of a rule are met by an item, the associated action occurs. Outlook 
provides an easy way to create rules through the Folder Assistant. The 
Folder Assistant, shown in Figure 4-7, allows you to create, edit, delete, enable, 
disable, and order rules. We will step through an example later in this section.</p>

<P>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f04oh07x.htm')"> <img src="images/f04oh07.JPG" width=404 height=196 border=0 ALT="Click to view at full size."> </A>
</P><P>
<!-- CAPTION --><B>Figure 4-7</B> <I>The Outlook Folder Assistant helps you create custom rules for your applications.</I><!-- /CAPTION -->
</p>

<A NAME="116"><H3>Setting the Conditions for a Rule</H3></A>

<P>The conditions for a rule can range from very simple, such as checking who 
the item is from, to very complex, such as checking who the item is from and 
also searching the subject and text for specific phrases or text strings.</p>

<P>The Folder Assistant allows you to specify multiple conditions as well 
as multiple arguments within a single condition. Multiple arguments in a 
condition are separated with semicolons. When processing incoming items for a 
rule, Exchange Server ORs the arguments together. If the item meets one of 
the arguments, the associated action occurs. One example is to create a single 
rule that checks whether an incoming item is from multiple people. To do this, 
you use the From condition and separate each name with a semicolon, such 
as <I>FROM:Michael Rizzo; Jo Brown</I>. If the item is from either Michael Rizzo or 
Jo Brown, the action for the rule will occur.</p>

<P>If you specify multiple conditions on different items within a rule, 
Exchange Server will AND the conditions. All conditions must return true for the 
action to occur. For example, if you specify the From condition to be 
<I>FROM:Jo Brown</I> and the Subject condition to be <I>SUBJECT:New sales quote</I>, the item must both be from Jo Brown and have a subject of <I>New sales 
quote</I> for the action to occur.</p>

<P>You can combine the two techniques to make more complex 
conditions with multiple arguments. For example, suppose in a discussion database, 
you set the message Body condition to be 
<I>BODY:help;problem</I> and the From condition to be 
<I>FROM:CEO;CIO</I>. If a message is submitted to the folder from 
either the CEO or CIO and has either <I>help</I> or 
<I>problem</I> in the message body, your rule's action will occur. My recommendation for the action for this rule is to 
forward it to the help desk as a high-priority message!</p>

<P>In addition to allowing you to specify simple conditions such as the 
subject, name of the sender, and name of the intended recipient, the Folder 
Assistant allows you to set up what are called advanced conditions. Some 
examples of advanced conditions include size of the item, date ranges, and the 
presence of attachments. You can even specify advanced conditions that check 
user-defined fields on forms, folders, and custom office document properties.</p>

<P>One other advanced feature is the ability to create rules that fire when 
the conditions you specify are <I>not</I> met. For example, you might create a rule 
that fires for items that are from anyone except John Hand. To do this, you 
would specify <I>John Hand</I> in the From condition and then specify to only process 
the rule if the conditions are <I>not</I> met. This type of rule comes in handy when 
an inclusive condition, such as every user in an address book, is impractical to specify.</p>

<P>Finally, you can set an option in the Folder Assistant that will stop the 
rules engine from processing any subsequent rules after the current rule fires. You 
should use this condition when you have multiple rules in your folder and you 
want the current rule to be the last one applied.</p>

<A NAME="117"><H3>Setting the Actions for a Rule</H3></A>

<P>If the conditions of a rule are met, Exchange Server 
applies the rule's corresponding action to the item. There are four actions you can use in a rule, as shown in Figure 4-8.</p>

<P>

</P><P>
<!-- CAPTION --><B>Figure 4-8</B> <I>The Edit Rule dialog box. Notice the four key actions that you can set for your rules.</I><!-- /CAPTION -->
</p>

<P>Following is a description of these actions:</p>

<UL>
<P><LI><i>Return To Sender.</I> This action sends any item e-mailed into a 
folder back to the sender. Outlook does not allow the user to post the 
item. Instead, it returns notification that the user does not have 
permission to add this item into the folder.</li></p>

<P><LI><i>Delete.</I> This action deletes the item immediately. By setting 
this action, you disable other possible actions in the rule, such as 
Return To Sender, and you automatically enable the Do Not Process 
Subsequent Rules condition.</li></p>

<P><LI><i>Reply With.</I> This action automatically replies to the sender. You 
can customize the reply message by clicking the Template button, 
which opens a new message form. You can add recipients to the reply, 
enter custom message text, or insert any attachments that you want 
to include for the user. To save and close your reply template, 
choose Save &amp; Close from the File menu.</li></p>

<P><LI><i>Forward.</I> This action forwards all messages not marked as private 
to a specified recipient. You can specify the method that Outlook 
uses to forward the item. The options for this are Standard, Leave 
Message Intact, or Insert Message As An Attachment.</li></p>
</UL>

<A NAME="118"> <H3>Applying Rules</H3></A>

<P>Exchange Server will process multiple rules in the order that they appear in 
the Folder Assistant, which is from top to bottom. To change the order in 
which rules are applied, use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to move a 
rule higher or lower in the list, respectively.</p>

<A NAME="119"><H3>Implementing Public Folder Rules</H3></A>

<P>To help you understand how to implement public folder rules, we are going 
to customize the Account Tracking and Document Library applications with 
rules we create. For the Account Tracking application, we're going to add a 
custom reply for the user who submits an item. This reply will state that the folder 
has received the new item. Follow these steps:</p>

<OL>
<P><LI>Find the Account Tracking folder in the folder list, right-click on 
it, and select Properties from the context menu.</li></p>

<P><LI>On the Administration tab, click the Folder Assistant button.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click the Add Rule button. The Edit Rule dialog box appears.</li></p>

<P><LI>Check the Reply With check box.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click the Template button to display the reply template.</li></p>

<P><LI>In the reply template, type this in the Subject field: 
<I>Your item has been received</I>. In the message body, enter 
<I>Thank you for submitting your item to the Account Tracking application. Your item should 
be available immediately for other people in the organization to 
use</I>.</li></p>

<P><LI>From the File menu, select Save &amp; Close.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click OK in the Edit Rule dialog box. Outlook prompts you 
that this rule will fire for all incoming messages. Click Yes.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click OK in the Folder Assistant dialog box. (If a message box 
is displayed indicating that you do not have Send As permission, 
check with your Exchange Server administrator to ensure that you have 
Send As permission on the public Account Tracking folder. See 
Knowledge Base article Q152113 for more information.)</li></p>
</OL>

<P>You should see your new rule in the Folder Assistant. Try posting a 
new message to the Account Tracking application to test your rule.</p>

<P>For the Document Library application, we're going to add an 
advanced custom rule that will check the Author property of the Microsoft Office 
document. If the author is not a member of our team, the item will be returned 
to the sender. To add this rule, follow these steps:</p>

<OL>
<P><LI>Follow steps 1 through 3 from the preceding procedure for the 
Document Library folder.</li></p>

<P><LI>In the Edit Rule dialog box, click the 
Advanced button. In the Show Properties Of area, select the Document option.</li></p>
</OL>

<P><DIV CLASS="NOTE"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE</B><HR>
On some configurations, the properties do not 
display when you select the Document option.
</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></P>

<OL>
<P><LI value="3">Enable the Author property in the Show Properties Of section. 
For the values, type the names of people on your team; separate the 
names with semicolons.</li></p>

<P><LI>Enable the Only Items That Do Not Match These Conditions 
check box. Click OK.</li></p>

<P><LI>Enable the Return To Sender check box.</li></p>

<P><LI>Click OK three times.</li></p>
</OL>

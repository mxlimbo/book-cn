<A NAME="490"><H1>Design Goals of the ADSI Object Library</H1></A>

<P>The ADSI library is the strategic library for accessing directory objects 
and information from Microsoft, and it doesn't matter whether this information 
is in Exchange Server or the forthcoming Active Directory. When designing 
ADSI, Microsoft had three primary goals in mind. First, ADSI had to be based on 
COM and on providers to access directory information. In a provider-based 
model, the client interacts with the COM interfaces exposed by the ADSI library, 
and the installed providers convert the calls in the interfaces into function calls 
that access the targeted directory provider. The provider model allows the same 
calls to be used in an ADSI client application to access any type of directory with 
an ADSI provider. ADSI ships with four primary directory providers&#8212;a 
Microsoft Windows NT directory provider for Windows NT 4.0, a Novell NDS 
provider, a Novell Netware Bindery provider for Netware versions before 
4<I>.x,</I> and an LDAP provider&#8212;but you can write your own because the ADSI provider 
architecture is extensible. We will focus on the built-in LDAP provider in this 
chapter because it supports accessing and updating the Exchange Server directory.</p>

<P><div class="sidebar">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>What Is the Active Directory?</B>
<P>The Active Directory is the directory technology integrated 
into Microsoft Windows 2000 Server products. It is the next generation 
of directory services offered by Microsoft. Because the Active 
Directory is built on Exchange Server technology, you will already be familiar 
with some of its capabilities and APIs. By placing information in the 
Exchange Server directory, you can easily migrate to the Active 
Directory by using the replication capabilities of the Exchange Active 
Directory Connector, which is included with Windows 2000 Server.</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></P>

<P>Microsoft's second goal for ADSI was to allow developers to use any 
COM-based development tool with the object library, including Visual Basic, 
Visual C++, Java, VBScript, and JavaScript. You can decide which tool is the best 
for creating your ADSI Exchange Server applications. In this chapter, I use 
VBScript and Microsoft Active Server Pages to create a web-based administrator 
program for Exchange Server. However, this application easily could have been 
written in Visual Basic or Java.</p>

<P>The third goal of ADSI was to provide you with a single directory API 
as a replacement for multiple directory APIs. With Exchange Server, you can 
use CDO or Directory API (DAPI) to access information stored in the 
Exchange Server directory. With the Windows NT directory, you can use the Win32 
directory functions to access information stored in the Windows NT directory. 
However, depending on your application, you can more easily write to a single 
set of interfaces and use different providers for these directory services rather 
than learn two or three different APIs. With ADSI, you need to learn only one 
API to use a multitude of directory services.</p>

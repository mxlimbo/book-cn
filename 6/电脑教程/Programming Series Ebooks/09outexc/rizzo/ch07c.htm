<A NAME="219"><H1>Setting Up the Application</H1></A>

<P>To install the Account Tracking application, you'll need a machine that 
has Outlook 98 and at least one application from Microsoft Office 97 
installed, preferably Excel 97. You'll also need to have a user account on a 
Microsoft Exchange Server. Now let's step through setting up the Account 
Tracking application.</p>

<P><DIV CLASS="NOTE"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE</B><HR>
Files copied from CDs have their Read-only flags set. 
When setting up the applications included with this book, be aware that 
you may need to clear these Read-only flags after copying files from 
the companion CD.
</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></P>

<A NAME="220"><H2>Copying the Account Tracking Folder</H2></A>

<P>First you will need to copy the Account Tracking folder from the .pst file 
included on the companion CD to your Public Folders in Exchange. To do this, 
copy the ExBook.pst file from the CD to your local hard drive. Clear the 
Read-only flag for this file. In Outlook 98, choose File, point to Open, and then 
select Personal Folders File (.pst). In the Open Personal Folders dialog box, 
locate ExBook.pst on your hard drive, select it, and click OK. At this point, the 
file folder named ExBook should be displayed in your Outlook Folder List. 
Expand the ExBook file folder to display the Account Tracking folder. While 
pressing the Ctrl key, drag and drop the Account Tracking folder to the location in 
the Public Folder tree where you want the folder to appear. Pressing the Ctrl 
key will make a copy of the Account Tracking folder.</p>

<P><DIV CLASS="NOTE"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE</B><HR>
If you do not copy the Account Tracking folder from 
the ExBook.pst file folder to your Public Folders, the Assign Task 
To functionality will not work. 
</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></P>

<A NAME="221"><H2>Copying the Product Sales Database</H2></A>

<P>Included on the companion CD is a sample Access database named 
Sales.mdb. The application can use this sample product sales database to retrieve 
product sales and quota information for an account previously entered in the 
database. The default location for this sales database is in the root of your C: drive, 
but you can change this location by modifying some of the VBScript code in 
the Account Tracking form. By default, the application does not use the 
database, but you can change this setting in the VBScript for the 
form. To configure the Access database, follow these steps:</p>

<OL>
<P><LI>From the companion CD, copy the file named Sales.mdb to 
your local hard drive and clear its Read-only flag.</li></p>

<P><LI>In the Outlook Public Folders list, select the Account Tracking 
folder you just copied.</li></p>

<P><LI>Launch the Account Tracking form by selecting New Account 
Info from the Actions menu. If a message box is shown that 
indicates the form can't be displayed because the Expression Service failed 
to start, you most likely don't have the Expression Service 
installed. To install the Expression Service, run setup for Outlook 98 and 
install the Expression Service component.</li></p>

<P><LI>Select Tools\Forms\Design This Form.</li></p>

<P><LI>From the Form menu, select View Code.</li></p>

<P><LI>If you do want to use the sales database, in the Global 
Declaration section, change the line</li></p>

<P><TABLE CELLPADDING="5" WIDTH="95%"><TR><TD>
<PRE>
bUseDatabase = 0
</PRE></TD></TR></TABLE></P>

<P>to</p>

<P><TABLE CELLPADDING="5" WIDTH="95%"><TR><TD>
<PRE>
bUseDatabase = 1
</PRE></TD></TR></TABLE></P>

<P>If you want to change the location of the database, find the 
<I>Item_Open</I> subroutine. Change the parameter in the line</p>

<P><TABLE CELLPADDING="5" WIDTH="95%"><TR><TD>
<PRE>
InitializeDatabase &quot;c:\sales.mdb&quot;
</PRE></TD></TR></TABLE></P>

<P>to reflect the location of the database. For example, if the database 
is located on a file share, you would change the line to</p>

<P><TABLE CELLPADDING="5" WIDTH="95%"><TR><TD>
<PRE>
InitializeDatabase &quot;\\fileserver\fileshare\sales.mdb&quot;
</PRE></TD></TR></TABLE></P>

</ol>

<P><DIV CLASS="NOTE"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE</B><HR>
Although an Access database is being used in this 
sample application, you could also use Microsoft SQL Server.
</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></P>

<OL>
<P><LI value="7">Publish the form to save your changes by opening the Tools 
menu from the Account Tracking form, pointing to Forms, and then 
selecting Publish Form.</li></p>
</OL>

<A NAME="222"><H2>Setting Permissions on the Folder</H2></A>

<P>After configuring the database, you need to set permissions on the folder. 
For example, you might want to give all users the ability to submit new items 
to the folder but give only the internal sales teams the ability to read and edit 
items in the folder. You also might want to create multiple folders for the 
different internal sales teams so that each team accesses only its accounts, contacts, 
and tasks. To set up permissions for the application, right-click on the 
Account Tracking folder in the folder list and select Properties. Click on the 
Permissions tab, and then use the menus to set the permissions for the different users 
of the application. Consider using distribution lists to simplify setting 
permissions for teams of individuals.</p>

<A NAME="357"> <H1>Overview of the CDO Library</H1></A>

<P>The CDO library is a hierarchical library consisting of objects and 
collections. Throughout this hierarchy, you can create children objects from their 
parent objects. As you read the chapter, you'll find the same collection for 
different objects. While these duplicated collections might have the same name, the 
information each accesses is specific to the object each refers to.</p>

<P>In the CDO library, the Session object is the highest-level parent of all 
the other objects and contains all objects and collections. This makes sense 
since you need some type of session, either an Exchange Server session or an 
offline session, to start accessing information stored in an Exchange Server 
database. Figure 11-1 shows the hierarchy of the CDO library, which begins with 
the Session object.</p>

<P><DIV CLASS="NOTE"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE</B><HR>
If you're familiar with ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), 
it might be helpful to know that the Session object is similar to the 
ADO Connection object. However, do not confuse the Session object 
in ASP with the Session object in CDO. They are two entirely 
different objects.

<!-- CAPTION --><B>Figure 11-1</B> <I>The CDO library hierarchy. Notice how all other objects are created from the CDO Session object.</I><!-- /CAPTION -->
</p>

<P>As you can see from Figure 11-1, the CDO library is quite logical in 
its layout of collections and objects. Below the Session object are the major 
collections and objects of the CDO library, such as the InfoStores collection, 
which contains the data stores for your application, and the AddressLists 
collection, which contains the address entries your application can use. Below these 
major collections are other collections such as the Folders collection, which 
contains the folders for a particular InfoStore, and the Messages collection, which 
contains the messages for a particular folder. The CDO library is one of the 
most approachable Microsoft object libraries and allows you to quickly build 
powerful collaborative applications.</p>

<A NAME="358"><H2>Getting Help with the CDO Library</H2></A>

<P>While this chapter provides an overview of the CDO library, you might also 
want to look at the CDO help file, which provides useful information as well as 
code samples. The CDO Windows Help file (cdo.hlp) can be found on the 
Exchange Server 5.5 CD or on the Outlook 98 CD. The CDO compiled HTML 
Help file (cdo.chm) is available on the companion CD. It is also available as part 
of the Platform SDK section of the MSDN Library, which can be accessed 
online at <I><A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/developer/sdk/" TARGET="_window2">http://msdn.microsoft.com/developer/sdk/</A>.</I> </p>

<P>For additional CDO information, refer to the &quot;Programming Outlook 
and Exchange Supplement&quot; on the companion CD. Use it to learn about the 
CDO library methods and properties not discussed in this chapter. Also refer to 
the section at the end of this chapter, which contains some tips and tricks for 
building CDO applications.</p>

<A NAME="542"><H1>Appendix C -- Winsock Error Codes</H1></A>

<p>This appendix lists the Winsock error codes by error number. This list does not include the Winsock errors marked BSD-specific or undocumented. In addition, the Winsock errors that map directly to Win32 errors appear toward the end of this appendix.</p>

<p><b>10004&#8212;<i>WSAEINTR</i></b></p>

<p><b>Interrupted function call. </b>  This error indicates that a blocking call was interrupted by a call to <i>WSACancelBlockingCall</i>.</p>

<p><b>10009&#8212;<i>WSAEBADF</i></b></p>

<p><b>Bad file handle. </b>  This error means that the supplied file handle is invalid. Under Microsoft Windows CE, it is possible for the <i>socket</i> function to return this error, which indicates that the shared serial port is busy.</p>

<p><b>10013&#8212;<i>WSAEACCES</i></b></p>

<p><b>Permission denied. </b>  An attempt was made to manipulate the socket, which is forbidden. This error most commonly occurs when attempting to use a broadcast address in <i>sendto</i> or <i>WSASendTo</i>, in which broadcast permission has not been set with <i>setsockopt</i> and the <i>SO_BROADCAST</i> option.</p>

<p><b>10014&#8212;<i>WSAEFAULT</i></b></p>

<p><b>Invalid address. </b>  The pointer address passed into the Winsock function is invalid. This error is also generated when the specified buffer is too small.</p>

<p><b>10022&#8212;<i>WSAEINVAL</i></b></p>

<p><b>Invalid argument. </b>  An invalid argument was specified. For example, specifying an invalid control code to <i>WSAIoctl</i> will generate this error. Plus, it can indicate an error with the current state of a socket&#8212;for example, calling <i>accept</i> or <i>WSAAccept</i> on a socket that is not listening.</p>

<p><b>10024&#8212;<i>WSAEMFILE</i></b></p>

<p><b>Too many open files. </b>  Too many sockets are open. Typically, the Microsoft providers are limited only by the amount of resources available on the system.</p>

<p><b>10035&#8212;<i>WSAEWOULDBLOCK</i></b></p>

<p><b>Resource temporarily unavailable. </b>  This error is most commonly returned on nonblocking sockets in which the requested operation cannot complete immediately. For example, calling <i>connect</i> on a nonblocking socket will return this error because the connection request cannot be completed immediately.</p>

<p><b>10036&#8212;<i>WSAEINPROGRESS</i></b></p>

<p><b>Operation now in progress. </b>  A blocking operation is currently executing. Typically, you will not see this error unless you are developing 16-bit Winsock applications.</p>

<p><b>10037&#8212;<i>WSAEALREADY</i></b></p>

<p><b>Operation already in progress. </b>  This error typically occurs when an operation that is already in progress is attempted on a nonblocking socket&#8212;for example, calling <i>connect</i> or <i>WSAConnect</i> a second time on a nonblocking socket already in the process of connecting. This error can also occur when a service provider is in the process of executing a callback function (for those Winsock functions that support callback routines).</p>

<p><b>10038&#8212;<i>WSAENOTSOCK</i></b></p>

<p><b>Socket operation on an invalid socket. </b>  This error can be returned from any Winsock function that takes a <i>SOCKET</i> handle as a parameter. This error indicates that the supplied socket handle is not valid.</p>

<p><b>10039&#8212;<i>WSAEDESTADDRREQ</i></b></p>

<p><b>Destination address required. </b>  This error indicates that the supplied address was omitted. For instance, calling <i>sendto</i> with the destination address <i>INADDR_ANY</i> will return this error.</p>

<p><b>10040&#8212;<i>WSAEMSGSIZE</i></b></p>

<p><b>Message too long. </b>  This error can mean a number of things. If a message is sent on a datagram socket that is too large for the internal buffer, this error occurs. It also occurs if the message is too large because of a network limitation. Finally, if upon receiving a datagram the buffer is too small to receive the message, this error is generated.</p>

<p><b>10041&#8212;<i>WSAEPROTOTYPE</i></b></p>

<p><b>Wrong protocol type for socket. </b>  A protocol was specified in a call to <i>socket</i> or <i>WSASocket</i> that does not support the semantics of the given socket type. For example, requesting to create an IP socket of type <i>SOCK_STREAM</i> and protocol <i>IPPROTO_UDP</i> will generate this error.</p>

<p><b>10042&#8212;<i>WSAENOPROTOOPT</i></b></p>

<p><b>Bad protocol option. </b>  An unknown, unsupported, or invalid socket option or level was specified in a call to <i>getsockopt</i> or <i>setsockopt</i>.</p>

<p><b>10043&#8212;<i>WSAEPROTONOSUPPORT</i></b></p>

<p><b>Protocol not supported. </b>  Either the requested protocol is not installed on the system or no implementation exists for it. For example, if TCP/IP is not installed on the system, attempting to create either a TCP or a UDP socket will generate this error.</p>

<p><b>10044&#8212;<i>WSAESOCKTNOSUPPORT</i></b></p>

<p><b>Socket type not supported. </b>  Support for the specified socket type does not exist for the given address family. For example, requesting a socket of type <i>SOCK_RAW</i> for a protocol that does not support raw sockets will generate this error.</p>

<p><b>10045&#8212;<i>WSAEOPNOTSUPP</i></b></p>

<p><b>Operation not supported. </b>  The attempted operation is not supported for the referenced object. Typically, this occurs when trying to call a Winsock function on a socket that does not support that operation. For example, calling <i>accept</i> or <i>WSAAccept</i> on a datagram socket will cause this error.</p>

<p><b>10046&#8212;<i>WSAEPFNOSUPPORT</i></b></p>

<p><b>Protocol family not supported. </b>  The requested protocol family does not exist or is not installed on the system. In most cases, this error is interchangeable with <i>WSAEAFNOSUPPORT</i>, which occurs more often.</p>

<p><b>10047&#8212;<i>WSAEAFNOSUPPORT</i></b></p>

<p><b>Address family does not support requested operation. </b>  This error occurs when attempting to perform an operation that is not supported by the socket type. For example, trying to call <i>sendto</i> or <i>WSASendTo</i> with a socket of type <i>SOCK_STREAM</i> will generate this error. This error can also occur when calling <i>socket</i> or <i>WSASocket</i> and requesting an invalid combination of address family, socket type, and protocol.</p>

<p><b>10048&#8212;<i>WSAEADDRINUSE</i></b></p>

<p><b>Address already in use. </b>  Under normal circumstances, only one socket is permitted to use each socket address. (For example, an IP socket address consists of the local IP address and port number.) This error is usually associated with the <i>bind</i>, <i>connect</i>, and <i>WSAConnect</i> functions. The socket option <i>SO_REUSEADDR</i> can be set with the <i>setsockopt</i> function to allow multiple sockets access to the same local IP address and port. (For more information, see <a href="ch09a.htm">Chapter 9</A>.)</p>

<p><b>10049&#8212;<i>WSAEADDRNOTAVAIL</i></b></p>

<p><b>Cannot assign requested address. </b>  This error occurs when the address specified in an API call is not valid for that function. For example, specifying an IP address in <i>bind</i> that does not correspond to a local IP interface will generate this error. This error also can occur when specifying port 0 for the remote machine to connect to with <i>connect</i>, <i>WSAConnect</i>, <i>sendto</i>, <i>WSASendTo</i>, and <i>WSAJoinLeaf</i>.</p>

<p><b>10050&#8212;<i>WSAENETDOWN</i></b></p>

<p><b>Network is down. </b>  The operation encountered a dead network. This could indicate the failure of the network stack, the network interface, or the local network.</p>

<p><b>10051&#8212;<i>WSAENETUNREACH</i></b></p>

<p><b>Network is unreachable. </b>  An operation was attempted to an unreachable network. This indicates that the local host does not know how to reach the remote host&#8212;in other words, no known route to the destination exists.</p>

<p><b>10052&#8212;<i>WSAENETRESET</i></b></p>

<p><b>Network dropped the connection on reset. </b>  The connection has been broken because keepalives have detected a failure. This error can also occur when attempting to set the <i>SO_KEEPALIVE</i> option with <i>setsockopt</i> on a connection that has already failed.</p>

<p><b>10053&#8212;<i>WSAECONNABORTED</i></b></p>

<p><b>Software caused the connection to abort. </b>  An established connection was aborted due to a software error. Typically, this means the connection was aborted due to a protocol or timeout error.</p>

<p><b>10054&#8212;<i>WSAECONNRESET</i></b></p>

<p><b>Connection reset by peer. </b>  An established connection was forcibly closed by the remote host. This error can occur if the remote process is abnormally terminated (as in memory violation or hardware failure) or if a hard close was performed on the socket. A socket can be configured for a hard close using the <i>SO_LINGER</i> socket option and <i>setsockopt</i>. (For more information, see <a href="ch09a.htm">Chapter 9</A>.)</p>

<p><b>10055&#8212;<i>WSAENOBUFS</i></b></p>

<p><b>No buffer space available. </b>  The requested operation could not be performed because the system lacked sufficient buffer space.</p>

<p><b>10056&#8212;<i>WSAEISCONN</i></b></p>

<p><b>Socket is already connected. </b>  A connection is being attempted on a socket that is already connected. This can occur on both datagram and stream sockets. When using datagram sockets, if <i>connect</i> or <i>WSAConnect</i> has been called to associate an endpoint's address for datagram communication, attempting to call either <i>sendto</i> or <i>WSASendTo</i> will generate this error.</p>

<p><b>10057&#8212;<i>WSAENOTCONN</i></b></p>

<p><b>Socket is not connected. </b>  This error occurs when a request is made to send or receive data on a connection-oriented socket that is not currently connected.</p>

<p><b>10058&#8212;<i>WSAESHUTDOWN</i></b></p>

<p><b>Cannot send after socket shutdown. </b>  The socket has already been partially closed by a call to <i>shutdown</i>, and either a send or a receive operation is being requested. Note that this occurs only on the data-flow direction that has been shut down. For example, after calling <i>shutdown</i> on sends, any call to send data will generate this error.</p>

<p><b>10060&#8212;<i>WSAETIMEDOUT</i></b></p>

<p><b>Connection timed out. </b>  This error occurs when a connection request has been made and the remote computer fails to properly respond (or doesn't respond at all) after a specified length of time. This error is typically seen when the socket options <i>SO_SNDTIMEO</i> and <i>SO_RCVTIMEO</i> are set on a socket as well as when the <i>connect</i> and <i>WSAConnect</i> functions are called. For more information on setting <i>SO_SNDTIMEO</i> and <i>SO_RCVTIMEO</i> on a socket, see <a href="ch09a.htm">Chapter 9</A>.</p>

<p><b>10061&#8212;<i>WSAECONNREFUSED</i></b></p>

<p><b>Connection refused. </b>  The connection could not be established because the target machine refused it. This error usually occurs because no application on the remote machine is servicing connections on that address.</p>

<p><b>10064&#8212;<i>WSAEHOSTDOWN</i></b></p>

<p><b>Host is down. </b>  This error indicates that the operation has failed because the destination host is down; however, an application is more likely to receive the error <i>WSAETIMEDOUT</i> because it typically occurs when attempting to establish a connection.</p>

<p><b>10065&#8212;<i>WSAEHOSTUNREACH</i></b></p>

<p><b>No route to host. </b>  An operation was attempted to an unreachable host. This error is similar to <i>WSAENETUNREACH</i>.</p>

<p><b>10067&#8212;<i>WSAEPROCLIM</i></b></p>

<p><b>Too many processes. </b>  Some Winsock service providers set a limit on the number of processes that can simultaneously access them.</p>

<p><b>10091&#8212;<i>WSASYSNOTREADY</i></b></p>

<p><b>Network subsystem is unavailable. </b>  This error is returned when calling <i>WSAStartup</i>, and the provider cannot function because the underlying system that provides services is unavailable.</p>

<p><b>10092&#8212;<i>WSAVERNOTSUPPORTED</i></b></p>

<p><b>Winsock.dll version out of range. </b>  The requested version of the Winsock provider is not supported.</p>

<p><b>10093&#8212;<i>WSANOTINITIALISED</i></b></p>

<p><b>Winsock has not been initialized. </b>  A successful call to <i>WSAStartup</i> has not yet been performed.</p>

<p><b>10101&#8212;<i>WSAEDISCON</i></b></p>

<p><b>Graceful shutdown in progress. </b>  This error is returned by <i>WSARecv</i> and <i>WSARecvFrom</i> to indicate that the remote party has initiated a graceful shutdown. This error occurs on message-oriented protocols such as ATM.</p>

<p><b>10102&#8212;<i>WSAENOMORE</i></b></p>

<p><b>No more records found. </b>  This error is returned from <i>WSALookupServiceNext</i> to indicate that no additional records are left. This error is interchangeable with <i>WSA_E_NO_MORE</i>. Applications should check for both this error and <i>WSA_E_NO_MORE</i>.</p>

<p><b>10103&#8212;<i>WSAECANCELLED</i></b></p>

<p><b>Operation canceled. </b>  This error indicates that a call to <i>WSALookupServiceEnd</i> was made while a call to <i>WSALookupServiceNext</i> was still processing. <i>WSALookupServiceNext</i> returns this error. This code is interchangeable with <i>WSA_E_CANCELLED</i>. Applications should check for both this error and <i>WSA_E_CANCELLED</i>.</p>

<p><b>10104&#8212;<i>WSAEINVALIDPROCTABLE</i></b></p>

<p><b>The procedure call table is invalid. </b>  This error is typically returned by a service provider when the procedure table contains invalid entries. For more information on service providers, see <A HREF="ch14a.htm">Chapter 14</A>.</p>

<p><b>10105&#8212;<i>WSAEINVALIDPROVIDER</i></b></p>

<p><b>Invalid service provider. </b>  This error is associated with service providers and occurs when the provider cannot establish the correct Winsock version needed to function correctly.</p>

<p><b>10106&#8212;<i>WSAEPROVIDERFAILEDINIT</i></b></p>

<p><b>The provider failed to initialize. </b>  This error is associated with service providers and is typically seen when the provider cannot load the necessary DLLs.</p>

<p><b>10107&#8212;<i>WSASYSCALLFAILURE</i></b></p>

<p><b>System call failure. </b>  A system call that should never fail has failed.</p>

<p><b>10108&#8212;<i>WSASERVICE_NOT_FOUND</i></b></p>

<p><b>No such service found. </b>  This error is normally associated with registration and name resolution functions when querying for services. (See <A HREF="ch10a.htm">Chapter 10</A> for more information about these functions.) This error indicates that the requested service could not be found in the given name space.</p>

<p><b>10109&#8212;<i>WSATYPE_NOT_FOUND</i></b></p>

<p><b>Class type not found. </b>  This error is also associated with the registration and name resolution functions when manipulating service classes. When an instance of a service is registered, it must reference a service class that was previously installed with <i>WSAInstallServiceClass</i>.</p>

<p><b>10110&#8212;<i>WSA_E_NO_MORE</i></b></p>

<p><b>No more records found. </b>  This error is returned from <i>WSALookupServiceNext</i> to indicate that no additional records are left. It is interchangeable with <i>WSAENOMORE</i>. Applications should check for both this error and <i>WSAENOMORE</i>.</p>

<p><b>10111&#8212;<i>WSA_E_CANCELLED</i></b></p>

<p><b>Operation canceled. </b>  This error indicates that a call to <i>WSALookupServiceEnd</i> was made while a call to <i>WSALookupServiceNext</i> was still processing. <i>WSALookupServiceNext</i> returns this error. This code is interchangeable with <i>WSAECANCELLED</i>. Applications should check for both this error and <i>WSAECANCELLED</i>.</p>

<p><b>10112&#8212;<i>WSAEREFUSED</i></b></p>

<p><b>Query refused. </b>  A database query failed because it was actively refused.</p>

<p><b>11001&#8212;<i>WSAHOST_NOT_FOUND</i></b></p>

<p><b>Host not found. </b>  This error occurs with <i>gethostbyname</i> and <i>gethostbyaddr</i> to indicate that an authoritative answer host was not found.</p>

<p><b>11002&#8212;<i>WSATRY_AGAIN</i></b></p>

<p><b>Nonauthoritative host not found. </b>  This error is also associated with <i>gethostbyname</i> and <i>gethostbyaddr</i>, and it indicates that either the nonauthoritative host was not found or a server failure occurred.</p>

<p><b>11003&#8212;<i>WSANO_RECOVERY</i></b></p>

<p><b>A nonrecoverable error occurred. </b>  This error is also associated with <i>gethostbyname</i> and <i>gethostbyaddr</i>. It indicates that a nonrecoverable error has occurred and the operation should be tried again.</p>

<p><b>11004&#8212;<i>WSANO_DATA</i></b></p>

<p><b>No data record of the requested type found. </b>  This error is also associated with <i>gethostbyname</i> and <i>gethostbyaddr</i>. It indicates that the supplied name was valid but that no data record of the requested type was found with it.</p>

<p><b>11005&#8212;<i>WSA_QOS_RECEIVERS</i></b></p>

<p><b>At least one reserve message has arrived. </b>  This value is associated with IP Quality of Service (QOS) and is not an error per se. (See <A HREF="ch12a.htm">Chapter 12</A> for more on QOS.) It indicates that at least one process on the network is interested in receiving QOS traffic.</p>

<p><b>11006&#8212;<i>WSA_QOS_SENDERS</i></b></p>

<p><b>At least one path message has arrived. </b>  This value is associated with QOS and is more of a status message. This value indicates that at least one process on the network is interested in sending QOS traffic.</p>

<p><b>11007&#8212;<i>WSA_QOS_NO_SENDERS</i></b></p>

<p><b>No QOS senders. </b>  This value is associated with QOS and indicates that there are no longer any processes interested in sending QOS data. See <A HREF="ch12a.htm">Chapter 12</A> for a more complete description of when this error occurs.</p>

<p><b>11008&#8212;<i>WSA_QOS_NO_RECEIVERS</i></b></p>

<p><b>No QOS receivers. </b>  This value is associated with QOS and indicates that there are no longer any processes interested in receiving QOS data. See <A HREF="ch12a.htm">Chapter 12</A> for a more complete description of this error.</p>

<p><b>11009&#8212;<i>WSA_QOS_REQUEST_CONFIRMED</i></b></p>

<p><b>Reservation request has been confirmed. </b>  QOS applications can request that they be notified when their reservation request for network bandwidth has been approved. When such a request is made, this is the message generated. See <A HREF="ch12a.htm">Chapter 12</A> for a more complete description.</p>

<p><b>11010&#8212;<i>WSA_QOS_ADMISSION_FAILURE</i></b></p>

<p><b>Error due to lack of resources. </b>  Insufficient resources were available to satisfy the QOS bandwidth request.</p>

<p><b>11011&#8212;<i>WSA_QOS_POLICY_FAILURE</i></b></p>

<p><b>Invalid credentials. </b>  Either the user did not possess the correct privileges or the supplied credentials were invalid when making a QOS reservation request.</p>

<p><b>11012&#8212;<i>WSA_QOS_BAD_STYLE</i></b></p>

<p><b>Unknown or conflicting style. </b>  QOS applications can establish different filter styles for a given session. This error indicates either unknown or conflicting style types. See <A HREF="ch12a.htm">Chapter 12</A> for a description of filter styles.</p>

<p><b>11013&#8212;<i>WSA_QOS_BAD_OBJECT</i></b></p>

<p><b>Invalid <i>FILTERSPEC</i> structure or provider-specific object. </b>  This error occurs if either the <i>FLOWSPEC</i> structures or the provider-specific buffers of a QOS object are invalid. See <A HREF="ch12a.htm">Chapter 12</A> for more details.</p>

<p><b>11014&#8212;<i>WSA_QOS_TRAFFIC_CTRL_ERROR</i></b></p>

<p><b>Problem with a <i>FLOWSPEC</i>. </b>  This error occurs if the traffic control component has a problem with the supplied <i>FLOWSPEC</i> parameters that are passed as a member of a QOS object.</p>

<p><b>11015&#8212;<i>WSA_QOS_GENERIC_ERROR</i></b></p>

<p><b>General QOS error. </b>  This is a catchall error that is returned when the other QOS errors do not apply.</p>

<p><b>6&#8212;<i>WSA_INVALID_HANDLE</i></b></p>

<p><b>Specified event object invalid. </b>  This Win32 error is seen when using Winsock functions that map to Win32 functions. This particular error occurs when a handle passed to <i>WSAWaitForMultipleEvents</i> is invalid.</p>

<p><b>8&#8212;<i>WSA_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY</i></b></p>

<p><b>Insufficient memory available. </b>  This Win32 error indicates that insufficient memory is available to complete the operation.</p>

<p><b>87&#8212;<i>WSA_INVALID_PARAMETER</i></b></p>

<p><b>One or more parameters are invalid. </b>  This Win32 error indicates that a parameter passed into the function is invalid. This error also occurs with <i>WSAWaitForMultipleEvents</i> when the event count parameter is not valid.</p>

<p><b>258&#8212;<i>WSA_WAIT_TIMEOUT</i></b></p>

<p><b>Operation timed out. </b>  This Win32 error indicates that the overlapped operation did not complete in the specified time.</p>

<p><b>995&#8212;<i>WSA_OPERATION_ABORTED</i></b></p>

<p><b>Overlapped operation aborted. </b>  This Win32 error indicates that an overlapped I/O operation was canceled because of the closure of a socket. In addition, this error can occur when executing the <i>SIO_FLUSH</i> ioctl command.</p>

<p><b>996&#8212;<i>WSA_IO_INCOMPLETE</i></b></p>

<p><b>Overlapped I/O event object is not in a signaled state. </b>  This Win32 error is also associated with overlapped I/O. It is seen when calling <i>WSAGetOverlappedResults</i> and indicates that the overlapped I/O operation has not yet completed.</p>

<p><b>997&#8212;<i>WSA_IO_PENDING</i></b></p>

<p><b>Overlapped operations will complete later. </b>  When making an overlapped I/O call with a Winsock function, this Win32 error is returned to indicate that the operation is pending and will complete later. See <a href="ch08a.htm">Chapter 8</A> for a discussion of overlapped I/O.</p>

<P>This solution is a mixture of HTML and Microsoft Active Server Pages. To run 
this solution, you must open the Default.htm page using an http:// URL, meaning that 
you cannot simply double-click the files on the companion CD. The easiest way to 
set up the solution is to follow these steps:</P>

<OL>
<P><LI> If you are using a Microsoft Windows NT Server machine with 
Microsoft Internet Information Server, use the IIS manager to add a virtual 
directory to your root web. Copy the Chap07 and Scripts directories on the CD 
to the machine's hard drive, and specify those directories as the sources 
for peer virtual directories. Make sure to enable scripting support.</LI></P>

<P><LI> If you are running Personal Web Server (say on Windows 98 or 
Windows NT Workstation), use the Personal Web Manager to add a virtual 
directory as described in Step 1, but make sure that you select the Execute 
option in the Access section of the Add Directory dialog box.</LI></P>

<P><LI> Type the URL for the directory into your browser&#8212;for example, 
<I>http://MyServer/Chap07</I>. The Default.htm page should load unless you 
have configured your web site to use another default filename. If you have, 
just add <I>/Default.htm</I> to the end of the URL.</LI></P>
</OL>

<P>For tips on how to create virtual directories for ASP applications using 
Personal Web Server, see the sidebar &quot;<A HREF="ch06e.htm#146">Adding Virtual Directories Using Personal Web Server</A>&quot; in Chapter 6.</P>

<P>Note that the ASP page in this solution will use the LOGON_USER server 
variable for the current user name when saving reports. By default, IIS leaves the 
Allow Anonymous Access authentication method on, which means that LOGON_USER 
will return a blank string. If you want to enable the solution to save reports based on 
actual user names, disable anonymous access by editing the security settings of the 
virtual directory that contains the ASP page.</P>

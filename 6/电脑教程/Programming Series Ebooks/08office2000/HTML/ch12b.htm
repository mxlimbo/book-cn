<A NAME="226"><H1>Relationship to Office 2000</H1></A>

<P>As I mentioned in <A HREF="ch01a.htm">Chapter 1</A>, the Office Web Components have no technological 
tie to Office 2000. Our team statically linked all the common code from Office into 
the Office Web Components so that there would be no technological dependency. 
This enables you to deploy the components in your custom solutions before your 
organization deploys Office 2000. We also specifically designed the components to 
coexist with Office 95 and 97 so that it is safe to deploy the components on a client 
machine running a previous version of Office.</P>

<P>Although OWC has no <I>technological</I> dependency on Office 2000, it does 
have a <I>licensing</I> dependency. The OWC library is licensed as part of Office 2000, so 
any client machine using the components at either design time or runtime must have 
an Office 2000 license. The client machine does not have to install any other part of 
Office 2000, but it does need a valid Office 2000 license (which is just a piece of 
paper). Corporations that purchase site licenses for Office 2000 can freely redistribute 
the OWC library within the corporation, which is by far the easiest approach for 
developing and deploying information systems using the components.</P>

<P>Because the OWC library is licensed as part of Office 2000, it is 
automatically installed when a client installs Office 2000. Deploying Office 2000 is actually the 
easiest way to deploy the OWC library to client desktops, but this is often an unrealistic 
option for large corporations with many client desktops. To facilitate the advance rollout 
of only the Office Web Components and MDAC 2.1, our team developed a 
separate installation and a special installer control known as the Web Installer.</P>

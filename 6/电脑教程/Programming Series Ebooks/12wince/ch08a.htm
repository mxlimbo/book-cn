<A NAME="307"><H1>Processes and Threads</H1></A>

<P>Like Windows NT, Windows CE is a fully multitasking and multithreaded operating system. What does that mean? In this chapter I'll present a few definitions and then some explanations to answer that question.

<P>A <I>process</I> is a single instance of an application. If two copies of Microsoft Pocket Word are running, two unique processes are running. Every process has its own, protected, 32-MB address space as described in <A HREF="ch06a.htm">Chapter 6</a>. Windows CE enforces a limit of 32 separate processes that can run at any time.

<P>Each process has at least one <I>thread</I>. A thread executes code within a process. A process can have multiple threads running &quot;at the same time.&quot; I put the phrase<I> at the same time</I> in quotes because, in fact, only one thread executes at any instant in time. The operating system simulates the concurrent execution of threads by rapidly switching between the threads, alternatively stopping one thread and switching to another.

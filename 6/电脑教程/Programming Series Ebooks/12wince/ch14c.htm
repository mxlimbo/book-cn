<P>At this point, the system is up and running, but just what is running and how is it configured? Figure 14-3 shows the system after a reset has occurred. The diagram separates the individual processes into their memory slots. Remember that slot 0 is reserved for the currently active process. The list of DLLs that each process has loaded is shown below the name of the process.

<P>Note that Coredll.dll is loaded by every process. Coredll provides the entry points for most APIs supported by Windows CE. As a call is made into Coredll.dll, it redirects the call to the appropriate server process&#8212;NK, FileSys, Device, GWE, or Explorer.

<P>Notice that Shell.exe isn't shown in Figure 14-3. This is because when I captured the information for this figure, the Windows CE device I was using wasn't connected to a debug PC, so Shell.exe wasn't loaded.

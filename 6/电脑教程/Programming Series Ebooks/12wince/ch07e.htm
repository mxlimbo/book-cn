<P>We have covered a huge amount of ground in this chapter. The file system, while radically different under the covers, presents a standard Win32 interface to the programmer and a familiar directory structure to the user. The database API is unique to Windows CE and provides a valuable function for the information-centric devices that Windows CE supports. The registry structure and interface are quite familiar to Windows programmers and should present no surprises.

<P>The last two chapters have covered memory and the file system. Now it's time to look at the third part of the kernel triumvirate, processes and threads. As with the other parts of Windows CE, the API will be familiar if perhaps a bit smaller. However, the underlying architecture of Windows CE does make itself known.

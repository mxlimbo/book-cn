<P>Networks are at the heart of modern computer systems. Over the years, Microsoft Windows has supported a variety of networks and networking APIs. The evolving nature of networking APIs along with the need to keep systems backward compatible has resulted in a huge array of overlapping functions and parallel APIs. As in many places in Windows CE, the networking API is a subset of the vast array of networking functions supported under Windows NT and Windows 98.

<P>Windows CE supports a variety of networking APIs. This chapter covers two. First is the Windows Networking API, WNet. This API supports basic network connections so that a Windows CE device can access disks and printers on a network.

<P>Windows CE also supports a subset of the WinSock 1.1 API. I'm not going to cover the complete WinSock API because plenty of other books do that. I'll spend some time covering what is directly relevant to Windows CE developers. Of particular interest is the fact that that WinSock is the high-level API to the IrDA infrared communication stack. I'll also cover another extension to WinSock, the Internet control message protocol (ICMP) functions that allow Windows CE applications to ping other machines on a TCP/IP network.

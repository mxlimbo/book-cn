<P>From Kernighan and Ritchie to Petzold and on to Prosise, programming books traditionally start with a &quot;hello, world&quot; program. It's a logical place to begin. Every program has a basic underlying structure that, when not obscured by some complex task it was designed to perform, can be analyzed to reveal the foundation shared by all programs running on its operating system.

<P>In this programming book, the &quot;hello, world&quot; chapter covers the details of setting up and using the programming environment. The environment for developing Microsoft Windows CE applications is somewhat different from that for developing standard Microsoft Windows applications because Windows CE programs are written on PCs running Microsoft Windows NT and debugged mainly on separate, Windows CE-based target devices.

<P>While experienced Windows programmers might be tempted to skip this chapter and move on to meatier subjects, I suggest that they&#8212;you&#8212;at least skim the chapter to note the differences between a standard Windows program and a Windows CE program. A number of subtle and significant differences in both the development process and the basic program skeleton for Windows CE applications are covered in this first chapter.

<P>Understanding how windows work and relate to each other is the key to understanding the user interface of the Microsoft Windows operating system, whether it be Microsoft Windows 98, Microsoft Windows NT, or Microsoft Windows CE. Everything you see on a Windows display is a window. The desktop is a window, the taskbar is a window, even the Start button on the taskbar is a window. Windows are related to one another according to one relationship model or another; they may be in <I>parent/child,</I> <I>sibling,</I> or <I>owner/owned</I> relationships. Windows supports a number of predefined window classes, called <I>controls</I>. These controls simplify the work of programmers by providing a range of predefined user interface elements as simple as a button or as complex as a multiline text editor. Windows CE supports the same standard set of built-in controls as the other versions of Windows. These built-in controls shouldn't be confused with the complex controls provided by the common control library. I'll talk about those controls in <A HREF="ch05a.htm">Chapter 5</a>.

<P>Controls are usually contained in dialog boxes (sometimes simply referred to as <I>dialogs</I>). These dialog boxes constitute a method for a program to query users for information the program needs. A specialized form of dialog, named a <I>property sheet</I>, allows a program to display multiple but related dialog boxes in an overlapping style; each box or property sheet is equipped with an identifying tab. Property sheets are particularly valuable given the tiny screens associated with Windows CE devices.

<P>Finally, Windows CE supports a subset of the common dialog library available under Windows NT and Windows 98. Specifically, Windows CE supports versions of the common dialog boxes File Open, File Save, Color, and Print. These dialogs are somewhat different on Windows CE. They're reformatted for the smaller screens and aren't as extensible as their desktop counterparts.

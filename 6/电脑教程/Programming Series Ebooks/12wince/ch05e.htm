<P>Windows CE doesn't support four common controls seen under other versions of Windows. The animation control, the drag list control, the hot key control, and, sadly, the rich edit control are all unsupported. Animation would be hard to support given the slower processors often seen running Windows CE. The hot key control is problematic in that keyboard layouts and key labels, standardized on the PC, vary dramatically on the different hardware that runs Windows CE. And the drag list control isn't that big a loss, given the improved power of the report style of the list view control.

<P>The rich edit control is another story. The lack of an edit control that can contain multiple fonts and paragraph formatting is a noticeable gap in the Windows CE shell. Applications needing this functionality are forced to implement independent, and mutually incompatible, solutions. Let's hope the rich edit control is supported under future versions of Windows CE.

<P>Windows CE supports fairly completely the common control library seen under other versions of Windows. The date and time picker, month calendar, and command bar are a great help given the target audience of Windows CE devices. 

<P>I've spent a fair amount of time in the past few chapters looking at the building blocks of applications. Now it's time to turn to the operating system itself. Over the next three chapters, I'll cover memory management, files and databases, and processes and threads. These chapters are aimed at the core of the Windows CE operating system.

<A NAME="279"><h1>Menus and Other Resources</h1></A>
<p>Most Microsoft Windows programs include a customized icon that Windows displays 
in the upper left corner of the title bar of the application window. Windows also displays 
the program's icon when the program is listed in the Start menu, shown in the taskbar at 
the bottom of the screen, listed in the Windows Explorer, or shown as a shortcut on the 
desktop. Some programs&#8212;most notably graphical drawing tools such as Windows 
Paint&#8212;use customized mouse cursors to represent different operations of the program. Many 
Windows programs use menus and dialog boxes. Along with scroll bars, menus and dialog 
boxes are the bread and butter of the Windows user interface.

<p>Icons, cursors, menus, and dialog boxes are all related. They are all types of 
Windows &quot;resources.&quot; Resources are data and they are often stored in a program's .EXE 
file, but they do not reside in the executable program's data area. In other words, the 
resources are not immediately addressable by variables in the program's code. Instead, 
Windows provides functions that explicitly or implicitly load a program's resources into memory 
so that they can be used. We've already encountered two of these functions. They are 
<I>LoadIcon</I> and <I>LoadCursor</I>, and they have appeared in the sample programs in the assignment 
statements that define a program's window class structure. So far, these functions have 
loaded a binary icon or cursor image from within Windows and returned a handle to that icon 
or cursor. In this chapter, we'll begin by creating our own customized icons that are 
loaded from the program's own .EXE file.

<p>This book covers these resources:
<UL>

<p><li>Icons

<p><li>Cursors

<p><li>Character strings

<p><li>Custom resources

<p><li>Menus

<p><li>Keyboard accelerators

<p><li>Dialog boxes

<p><li>Bitmaps
</UL>

<p>The first six resources in the list are discussed in this chapter. Dialog boxes are covered 
in <a href="ch11aa.htm">Chapter 11</a> and bitmaps in <a href="ch14a.htm#426">Chapter 14</a>.

<A NAME="381"><h1>The Clipboard</h1></A><P>The Microsoft Windows clipboard allows data to be transferred from one program to 
another. It is a relatively simple mechanism that doesn't require much overhead in either the 
program that places data in the clipboard or the program that later gets access to it. Windows 
98 and Microsoft Windows NT come with Clipboard Viewer programs that show the 
current contents of the clipboard.
<P>Many programs that deal with documents or other data include an Edit menu 
with the options Cut, Copy, and Paste. When a user selects Cut or Copy, the program 
transfers data from the program to the clipboard. This data is in a particular format, usually text, 
a bitmap (a rectangular array of bits that correspond to the pixels of a display surface), or 
a metafile (a binary collection of drawing commands). When a user selects Paste from 
the menu, the program determines if the clipboard contains data in a format that the 
program can use and, if so, transfers data from the clipboard to the program.
<P>Programs should not transfer data into or out of the clipboard without an 
explicit instruction from the user. For example, a user who performs a Cut or a Copy (or a 
Ctrl-X or Ctrl-C) operation in one program should be able to assume that the data will remain 
in the clipboard until the next Cut or Copy operation.
<P>You may recall that an Edit menu was implemented in the later versions of 
the POPPAD programs shown in Chapters <a href="ch10a.htm#279">10</a> and <a href="ch11a.htm#331">11</a>. However, that simply involved 
sending messages to the edit control. In most cases you don't have that convenience; you 
must instead call the clipboard transfer functions yourself.
<P>This chapter will focus on transferring text to and from the clipboard. In later 
chapters, I'll show you how to use the clipboard with bitmaps (Chapters <a href="ch14a.htm#426">14</a>, <a href="ch15a.htm#473">15</a>, and <a href="ch16a.htm#520">16</a>) and 
metafiles (<a href="ch18a.htm#659">Chapter 18</a>).

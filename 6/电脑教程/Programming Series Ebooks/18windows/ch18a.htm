<A NAME="659"><h1>Metafiles</h1></A><P>Metafiles are to vector graphics as bitmaps are to raster graphics. While bitmaps 
generally originate from real-world images, metafiles are constructed by humans, generally 
helped out by computer programs. A metafile consists of a series of binary records that 
correspond to graphics function calls, generally to draw straight lines, curves, filled areas, and text.
<P>&quot;Paint&quot; programs create bitmaps; &quot;draw&quot; programs create metafiles. In a 
well-designed drawing program, you can easily &quot;grab&quot; a particular graphical object (such as a line) and 
move it somewhere else. That's because all the individual components of the picture are stored 
as separate records. In a paint program, such feats are not possible&#8212;you're generally 
restricted to removing or inserting rectangular chunks of the bitmap.
<P>Because the metafile describes an image in terms of graphical drawing 
commands, the metafile image can be scaled without loss of resolution. Bitmaps don't work that 
way: If you display a bitmap at twice the size, you don't get twice the resolution. The bits 
in the bitmap are simply replicated horizontally and vertically.
<P>A metafile can be converted to a bitmap, but with some loss of information: 
the graphical objects that make up the metafile are no longer separate and become 
blended together in one big image. Converting bitmaps to metafiles is a much more difficult 
job, usually restricted to very simple images and requiring a lot of processing power to 
analyze edges and outlines. However, a metafile can contain a command to 
<I>draw</I> a bitmap.
<P>Metafiles are used most often for sharing pictures among programs through the 
clipboard, although they can also exist on disk as clip art. Because metafiles describe a 
picture as a collection of graphics function calls, they generally take up much less space and are 
more device independent than bitmaps.
<P>Microsoft Windows supports two metafile formats and two sets of functions to 
support them. I'll first discuss the metafile functions supported since Windows 1.0, and still 
supported under the current 32-bit versions of Windows, and then discuss the &quot;enhanced 
metafile&quot; developed for the 32-bit versions of Windows. The enhanced metafiles have several 
improvements over the old metafile format and should be used whenever possible.

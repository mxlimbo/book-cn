<A NAME="61"><H1>Managing a Site Using Link View</H1></A>
<P>The Link View feature provides a graphical representation of the structure of 
a Web site. The graphical display shows the pages in the site and the links 
between them. Link View can depict a wide variety of objects in a site with various 
graphical icons. These objects include standard HTML pages, ASP Web pages, 
images, audio and video files, executables, and protocols such as Mail To, as well 
as data connections, data commands, data range headers, and generic 
designer controls. Link View is an extremely powerful tool for troubleshooting large 
sites with complex functionality. You can even chase links from one page to 
another and quickly determine when links are missing or corrupt.

</P>
<P>To open a Link View window:

</P>
<OL>
<P><LI>Choose View Links On WWW from the Tools menu.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Enter the URL of the site you want to view. This can be any site 
to which you have a valid connection, including sites located on 
the Internet if you have an open connection.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Click OK.
</LI>
</P>
</OL>




<P>The Link View window opens, with the site you selected shown in 
the middle. If you are connecting to a large site, you might want to pause the 
verification of each page when Link View first appears. To pause the 
verification step, choose Pause Verification from the Tools menu. To resume verification, 
choose the Resume Verification command.

</P>
<P>The Link View toolbar also appears if it was not visible before. It has 
a number of commands that let you adjust the filtering of the objects shown 
in the Link View. Table 2-5 below shows its commands.

</P>
<P>Most toolbar commands work on the currently selected object. You 
can also work with multiple objects.


</P>
<P>You can also open a Link View window on a current object in your 
project. An object's popup menu should include a View Links command 
whenever applicable.

</P>
<P>To open Link View on an object in the current project, take the 
following steps:

</P>
<OL>
<P><LI>Select the object(s) in Project Explorer on which to open Link View.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Right-click the selection.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Choose View Links from the popup menu.
</LI>
</P>
</OL>

<P>You must expand an object to display its links. Figure 2-18 shows a 
sample object expanded by selecting default.asp (from the AdventureWorks 
sample application) and then selecting the toolbar's Expand Links option.

</P>
<P>The arrows between the objects in a site are color-coded to indicate 
the link's status. You can see the broken link to 32x3dshaded.jpg in Figure 2-18. 
If a broken link exists, Link View provides a graphical clue that the link is 
broken. Table 2-6 describes the link colors.

</TR>
</TABLE>

</P>
<P>The icons representing the various objects in Link View provide a 
graphical indicator of the object's type and its status. The Visual InterDev Help file 
shows the icons for each type of object. To access Help for that view, press F1 
while Link View is displayed.

</P>
<P>You can also open a new Link View on an object currently displayed 
in Link View by taking the following steps:

</P>
<OL>
<P><LI>In the Link View window, select the object(s) on which to 
open Link View.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Right-click the selection, and choose the View Links command 
from the popup menu.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>A new Link View window opens with the new display. To 
alternate between the current view and the previous view, you can use 
the Next and Previous commands on the Window menu.
</LI>
</P>
</OL>




<P>The display within Link View changes as you move from object to 
object. When you select an object, all of the links to that object turn blue. The object 
also changes color to indicate that it is selected.

</P>
<P>You can view the links to and from an object by clicking on it. 
Visual InterDev also shows all the connections to and from that page. To view 
an object's full URL, place the cursor over the object for a second or so. The 
tooltip for an object changes if the link is broken. 

</P>
<P>The link status tooltips and URL tooltips that Link View displays are 
useful for tracking problems in a site. If only one link has a problem, it is most 
likely related to some type of access to that object. If a lot of links to the same 
server are down, there might be a problem with that server.

</P>
<P>Link View normally shows an error code when it displays the broken 
link tooltip. The error number is displayed from winInet.dll. This .dll file is the 
same one that Internet Explorer uses for its Internet connection. 

</P>
<P>You can zoom the Link View in and out using the Zoom Link View 
list box on the Link View toolbar.

</P>
<P>The popup menu for link objects also provides options that work 
with multiple pages. If you right-click an object or a group of selected objects, 
you can choose Expand Links to display the links for all pages. The Preview 
In Browser command opens the object in the default browser. The Open 
command opens the object in Edit mode.

</P>
<P>To send mail to the address specified by the Mail To command, 
right-click the Mail To icon and then choose Preview In Browser. To open a file for 
editing, double-click an object in a Link View for your project. This provides 
quick access to files within a complex project. The Open command also performs 
this task. You can also right-click an image and choose Preview In Browser to 
display it. To save the page in your project, choose Save As from the File menu.

</P>
<P>You can drag icons for an object from Link View into Internet 
Explorer, Word, Exchange Mail, or other applications that support drag-and-drop.

</P>
<P>You might occasionally need to refresh Link View, particularly when 
others are working on a site while you have the Link View window open. The 
Refresh command on the View menu updates the Link View display and 
performs a new verification on all objects in the site.

</P>
<A NAME="62"><H2>Directory Structure</H2></A>
<P>Visual InterDev 6 uses several directories you should be aware of. You 
should be aware of the directories and what Visual InterDev 6 stores there, and 
you should understand what you can move and what you should not move.

</P>
<P>The Visual InterDev program is stored, by default, in this structure:

</P>
<P><PRE>
C:\Program Files
    Microsoft Visual Studio
        VIntDev98
            bin
            Layouts
            Samples
            Script Library
            Templates
            Themes
</PRE>

</P>
<P>If you have installed the Server Tools, you will also see the SrvSetup 
folder. Normally, you should leave the program files in their default locations. You 
may want to change the directories that store your Layouts and Templates.

</P>
<P>In addition to these directories, you will find some files that are used 
by Visual Studio and Visual InterDev 6 in the Common Files directory.

</P>
<P><PRE>
C:\Program Files
    Common Files
        Designer
        Microsoft Shared
        Services
</PRE>

</P>
<P>In the VIntDev98 directory structure, you might want to consider 
moving the Themes directory to a network share, if you have lots of users who 
use themes and work on a network.

</P>
<P>Your project files are stored, by default, in your profile area:

</P>
<P><PRE>
C:\Winnt\Profiles\user
    \Personal\Visual Studio Projects
        \projectname
</PRE>

</P>
<P><I>Projectname</I> will be the name of your project.

</P>
<P>Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) also uses a directory 
structure as a container for Web site and application files. The default IIS Web 
directory tree is illustrated below.

</P>
<P>In this example tree, WWWroot contains one Web application, 
<I>projectname</I>. The directories starting with an underscore (_) are system directories 

that contain files used by IIS, FrontPage Server Extensions, or Visual InterDev 
6. For instance, in this tree you can see the DataEnvironent directory under 
the _private directory. The DataEnvironent directory contains files used by the 
DE run-time engine.

</P>
<P><PRE>
C:\InetPub
    WWWroot
        projectname
            _derived
            Layouts
            _private
                DataEnvironment
                ProgrammingModel
            _ScriptLibrary
            _Themes
            _vti_bin
            _vti_cnf
            _vti_pvt
            _vti_txt
            images
</PRE>

</P>
<A NAME="63"><H2>File Types</H2></A>
<P>Visual InterDev creates several files when you either start a new Web site 
or add to a site. Some of the files are standard files such as HTML or text files, 
while others are specific to Visual InterDev. Other files that you will use 
frequently with a Web site project include ActiveX servers, ActiveX components, and 
source files for ASP Web pages. New file types are also added as new types of 
pages or applications are created. You can also create your own file types for Web sites.

</P>
<P>Visual InterDev Web sites and workspaces use the following file 
types most often:

</P>
<UL>
<P><LI>.sln files (Visual Studio Solution files) that store information 
about the current solution

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>.vip files (Visual InterDev Project) that store information about 
Visual InterDev projects

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>.opt files (Workspace options files) that store workspace settings

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>.htm files that are standard HTML files

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>.asp files that contain ActiveX server script and HTML code

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>.asa files that are global ASP files for an entire site

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>.ocx files that are ActiveX controls

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>.alx files (ActiveX Layout files)

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>.exe files that are standard executable files

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Other executable files that are often shared between applications

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>.dll (dynamic-link libraries) files that are ActiveX server-side 
components

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>.reg files used to register ActiveX components

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>.cab files that are setup files containing one or more compressed files

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>.stm files that contain HTML and VBScript and are used as 
include files for ASP Web pages

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>.inc files that contain HTML and VBScript and are used as 
include files for ASP Web pages
</LI></P>
</UL>




<P>This list does not include all the standard file types used in a Web site 
that represent different application needs, such as GIF, JPG, and WAV.

<A NAME="405"><H1>Secure Sockets Layer</H1></A>
<P>Secure Sockets Layer allows secure browsing across an unsecured network 
by encrypting all information sent in both directions. To implement SSL, you 
must obtain a certificate from a certification authority such as VeriSign because 
SSL is built on a public-key cryptosystem. You then apply that certificate to the 
Web server. Once the certificate is applied, you can mark any virtual directory 
on that Web server as requiring SSL for access.

</P>
<P>Figure 22-7 shows the Secure Communications dialog box within 
the Microsoft Management Console (Internet Information Server), where you 
can select the Require Secure Channel When Accessing This Resource check 
box. This check box is grayed out until you install a certificate on your Web 
server. In fact, if you have not yet installed a certificate and you try to access this 
dialog box (via the Secure Communications group box on the Directory 
Security tab of the Default Web Site Properties dialog box), you'll be presented with 
the Key Manager application. After installing your certificate on IIS, you'll also 
need to stop and restart the WWW service to have the check box enabled.

Secure Channel check box.</I><!-- /CAPTION -->

</P>
<P>If you want to try out Secure Sockets Layer, VeriSign offers a 
two-week trial certificate that you can obtain from its Web site (at 
<I><A TARGET="_window2" HREF="http://www.verisign.com/">http://www.verisign.com</A></I>). After you complete a form on that site, VeriSign will send you the free 
certificate via e-mail. This certificate will allow you to experiment with applying 
SSL to selected virtual directories on your Web server. Of course, it is intended 
for trial purposes only and is not for production use. Installing a server-side 
digital certificate on your Web server is a straightforward process and takes only 
a couple of minutes.

</P>
<P>When you enter a secure area within your site, the padlock icon in 
the lower right corner of Microsoft Internet Explorer will appear locked. You'll 
also get a message from the browser that you are entering a secure area. The 
protocol listed in the URL address will also switch from 
<I>http:</I> to <I>https:</I>, which is known as Secure HTTP&#8212;the secure form of the HTTP protocol. To switch 
to HTTPS, you have to make this change to the URL in the hyperlinks within 
your Web pages.

</P>
<P>For SSL to work, the user's browser must contain the requisite 
encryption software. Most popular browsers support SSL, including Netscape 
Navigator and Internet Explorer. Browsers that don't support SSL cannot access 
an SSL-secured site.

</P>
<P>To better understand how the server and a browser engage in an 
SSL-secured session, imagine the following conversation:

</P>
<P><I><B>Browser</B>: I'd like to see your default.htm page, please.</I>

</P>
<P><I><B>Server</B>: I am a secure Web server and will let you look at that page 
only if you are an SSL-enabled browser&#8212;which I see you are. Here is a 
copy of my certificate issued by a certification authority, so you know that 
I am the server you are trying to reach. Do you accept it?</I>

</P>
<P><I><B>Browser</B>: Thank you. I have confirmed that your certificate is valid 
and was issued by a certification authority that I recognize. I also notice 
that it has not yet expired. I will encrypt all communications with you 
and show a special icon to my users so that they know that we'll keep 
their secrets. I will use the </I>https:// <I>prefix on my requests for pages.</I>

</P>
<P><I><B>Server</B>: I will also encrypt communications. Anyone who tries to 
figure out what we're saying to one another will be wasting time.</I>

</P>
<P>
<div class="note"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE</B><HR>Encryption is a processor-intensive activity. Thus, greater 
demands are placed on the CPU of both the client and the server when 
communicating via SSL. Furthermore, by definition the encrypted data 
appears to be completely random. Data compression is done through the 
exploitation of discernible patterns in that data. Because the data has 
no discernable patterns, any communications devices (modems) that rely 
on data compression to speed throughput will not offer the same high 
performance that they would with unencrypted data. In other words, SSL 
can significantly reduce throughput.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV>

</P>
<P>Cryptanalysis of the SSL protocol is beyond the scope of this book, 
but many security experts believe that SSL provides adequate protection for 
transactions by individuals.

</P>

<div class="note"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE</B>
<HR>
Publishing to an SSL-secured Web site via HTTP can be 
done only using SSL. Visual InterDev 6.0 and FrontPage 98 both support 
HTTP publishing through a secure SSL channel.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV>

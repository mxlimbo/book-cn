<A NAME="114"><H1>Using Dynamic HTML</H1></A>
<P>One of the fastest ways to become familiar with Dynamic HTML (DHTML) 
is to think of it as a mechanism that allows you to encapsulate HTML 
elements and then script those elements using Microsoft VBScript or 
JScript. Almost every aspect of a rendered document is alterable at run time, with the added 
advantage that it is not necessary to download the entire document again just 
to change its appearance. Every element in the document becomes an 
individually addressable object at run time. The browser is capable of changing the 
look of one object while dynamically rearranging the other objects around it. 
This means that the objects in a DHTML document are simple, consistent, 
run-time-programmable entities.

</P>
<P>DHTML consists of several components and technologies that work 
together to provide dynamic features. These components and technologies are:

</P>
<UL>
<P><LI><B> Document Object Model</B> The Document Object Model refers 
to the elements in the document that expose properties, methods, 
and events that we can program against. Every element in the 
document is an object with these characteristics. The big learning curve 
is getting a handle on these objects and their interfaces.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B> Dynamic styles</B> You can dynamically change the style of 
any HTML element in a document. You can change colors, 
typefaces, spacing, indentation, position, and even the visibility of text. 
Because the Dynamic HTML Object Model makes every HTML element 
and attribute accessible, it is easy to use scripts to dynamically read 
and change styles.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B> Dynamic positioning</B> Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 
supports positioning and animation of elements even after a document 
has been loaded. Because the Dynamic HTML Object Model gives 
you access to styles and style sheets, you can set and change the 
position of an element as simply as you set and change its color. 
This makes it especially easy to change the position of elements 
based on how the user is viewing the document and even to animate 
the elements.

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B> Dynamic content</B> With Dynamic HTML, you can change 
the content of a document after it is loaded. Internet Explorer gives 
you a rich set of properties and methods to dynamically construct 
and alter documents, from inserting and deleting elements to 
modifying the text and attributes in individual elements. 

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI><B> Data binding</B> Several core HTML elements, together with 
&quot;traditional&quot; data-bound controls, combine to form a very flexible 
data-oriented architecture. <A HREF="ch16a.htm">Chapter 16</A> demonstrates how to use 
the data-binding features of DHTML.

<A NAME="398"><H1>Adding Security</H1></A>
<P>Security is extremely important. Placing a Web server on the Internet means 
that millions of people might have access to that server. Sensitive information 
must be protected from those who do not have the right to view it, yet it must 
still be made readily available for others. This is a fundamental challenge of 
Web server administration for those who deploy Internet applications, as well as 
those who manage intranet and extranet servers.

</P>
<P>Consider, for example, a corporate Human Resources application. 
All employees probably have the right to view their own information and 
request changes. A much smaller number of employees, such as the Human 
Resources department, might need to view all employee information. An even 
smaller group will be able to change an employee's benefits based on an 
employee request or other circumstance such as a promotion. Another small group 
will be able to modify the application itself. In many cases, only the Web 
administrator has the right to create a new application.

</P>
<P>Fortunately, several general mechanisms are available to address these 
and other security needs: access control, user authentication, and encryption. 
These mechanisms include but are not limited to
</P>
<UL>
<P><LI>IP Filtering

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Microsoft Windows NT User Access Rights

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions Permissions

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>NTFS Permissions

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Client Certificates

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Database Security
</LI></P>
</UL>




<P>The best way to implement security and make a site acceptably secure 
is to address each of these items in turn. The combination of these items yields 
a secure site that can deter all but the most determined hackers. It's always a 
trade-off, of course&#8212;the amount of time invested in applying security measures 
should be proportional to the sensitivity of your data. You'll also find that once 
you master these principles on one project, you can leverage your knowledge 
on future projects.

</P>
<P>You should always keep security in the back of your mind as you 
develop Microsoft Visual InterDev applications&#8212;especially those that go out over 
the Internet to reach your customers and business partners.

<A NAME="91"><H1>Introduction to the Data Environment</H1></A>
<P>The Data Environment (DE) in Microsoft Visual InterDev 6.0 collects your 
data connection and data manipulation code in one place. The Data 
Environment provides a standard interface for creating data-related objects and for 
placing them on Web pages. It also provides a layer of abstraction, allowing you to 
create and modify objects that represent your data independently of the database.

</P>
<P>The Data Environment is a new object-based wrapper around 
ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) and is used in both Visual InterDev 6.0 and 
Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0. The consistency of using the Data Environment in both 
Visual InterDev and Visual Basic makes developing applications in either 
environment easy. Moving from Visual InterDev to Visual Basic, and vice versa, also 
becomes easier. This integration is likely to increase as we see new versions of 
Microsoft development tools in Visual Studio.

</P>
<P>The Visual InterDev 6.0 Data Environment is created automatically 
when a data connection is added to a project. The DataEnvironment folder is 
displayed beneath the global.asa file in Project Explorer. Any data connections you 
add are displayed in the DataEnvironment folder.

</P>
<P>Using the Data Environment is the easiest way to create data-driven 
web pages. You can create data command objects that live at the DE level in 
your project and can be used by any ASP file in the project. You don't have to 
continually re-create a Recordset control on different ASP Web pages for the 
same set of records as we did in Visual InterDev 1.0. Now you can create a 
data command object once and use it to quickly create Recordset controls by 
dropping them into an ASP file in the editor. 

</P>
<P>Data-bound design-time controls (DTCs) are the basic building blocks 
for connecting to databases and displaying data on your Web pages. The 
Data Environment allows you to create and manage all your DTCs in one 
location. You don't need to create new controls for each Web page, and you need 
to create controls for the same set of records only once. Because your 
database code can be used repeatedly, building, debugging, and maintaining 
applications is much easier.

</P>
<P>A useful feature of the DE is the variety of drag-and-drop options. You can:

</P>
<UL>
<P><LI>Drag objects from the Data Environment and drop them into an 
ASP file to automatically create data-bound DTCs

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Drag the fields from a data command object's recordset and drop 
them onto an ASP Web page to automatically create data-bound DTCs

</LI>
</P>
<P><LI>Drag a table from Data View and drop it into an ASP file under 
a Recordset DTC created from dragging and dropping a data 
command object onto the page
</LI></P>
</UL>




<P>Figure 5-1 shows the Data Environment as it looks in Project Explorer 
with one data connection and one data command. You can see how the DE is 
attached to global.asa.

</P>
<P>Figure 5-1 shows the Northwind data connection and the 
GetCustomers data command. You can also see the fields in the GetCustomers recordset 
displayed beneath it. Each of these fields has a default data-bound DTC. The 
default is based upon the field's data type. You can right-click a field and assign it a 
specific DTC. That DTC will be used every time you drag the field from 
the recordset and drop it onto a page. We will discuss DTCs in more detail in <A HREF="ch06a.htm">Chapter 6 </A>
and throughout the remainder of the book.

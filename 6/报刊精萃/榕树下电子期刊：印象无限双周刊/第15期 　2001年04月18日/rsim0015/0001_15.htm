            Once upon a time you dressed so fine<br>
            You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?<br>
            people'd call, say, 'beware doll, you're bound to fall'<br>
            You thought they were all kiddin'you<br>
            You used to laugh about<br>
            Everybody that was hangin'out<br>
            Now you don't talk so loud<br>
            Now you don't seem so proud<br>
            About having to be scrounging for you next meal.<br>
            <br>
            How does it feel<br>
            How does it feel<br>
            To be without a home<br>
            Like a complete unknown<br>
            Like a rolling stone?<br>
            <br>
            You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely<br>
            But you know you only used to get juiced in it<br>
            And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street<br>
            And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it<br>
            You said you'd never compromise<br>
            With the mystery tramp, but now you realize<br>
            He's noy selling any alibis<br>
            As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes<br>
            And ask him do you want to make a deal?<br>
            <br>
            How does it feel<br>
            How does it feel<br>
            To be on your own<br>
            With no direction home<br>
            Like a complete unknown<br>
            Like a rolling stone?<br>
            <br>
            You never turned around to see <br>
            the frown on the jugglers and the clowns<br>
            When they all come down and did tricks for you<br>
            You never understood that it ain't no good<br>
            You should't let other people get your kicks for you<br>
            You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat<br>
            Who carried on his shoulders a Siamese eat<br>
            Ain't it hard when you discover that<br>
            He really wasn't where it's at<br>
            After he took from you everything he could steal.<br>
            <br>
            How does it feel<br>
            How does it feel<br>
            To be on your own<br>
            With no direction home<br>
            Like a complete unknown<br>
            Like a rolling stone?<br>
            <br>
            Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people <br>
            They're drinkin'thinkin that they got it made<br>
            Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things<br>
            But you'd better lift your diamond ring,<br>
            you'd better pawn it babe<br>
            You ued to be so amused<br>
            At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used<br>
            Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse<br>
            When you got nothing, yo got nothing to lose<br>
            You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.<br>
            <br>
            How does it feel<br>
            How does it feel<br>
            To be on your own<br>
            With no direction home<br>

            Starry, starry night.<br>
            Paint your palette blue and grey,<br>
            Look out on a summer's day,<br>
            With eyes that know the darkness in my soul.<br>
            Shadows on the hills,<br>
            Sketch the trees and the daffodils,<br>
            Catch the breeze and the winter chills,<br>
            In colors on the snowy linen land. <br>
            Now I understand what you tried to say to me,<br>
            How you suffered for your sanity,<br>
            How you tried to set them free.<br>
            They would not listen, they did not know how.<br>
            Perhaps they'll listen now. <br>
            <br>
            Starry, starry night.<br>
            Flaming flowers that brightly blaze,<br>
            Swirling clouds in violet haze,<br>
            Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue.<br>
            Colors changing hue, morning field of amber grain,<br>
            Weathered faces lined in pain,<br>
            Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand. <br>
            <br>
            Now I understand what you tried to say to me,<br>
            How you suffered for your sanity,<br>
            How you tried to set them free.<br>
            They would not listen, they did not know how.<br>
            Perhaps they'll listen now. <br>
            <br>
            For they could not love you,<br>
            But still your love was true.<br>
            And when no hope was left in sight<br>
            On that starry, starry night,<br>
            You took your life, as lovers often do.<br>
            But I could have told you, Vincent,<br>
            This world was never meant for one<br>
            As beautiful as you. <br>
            <br>
            Starry, starry night.<br>
            Portraits hung in empty halls,<br>
            Frameless head on nameless walls,<br>
            With eyes that watch the world and can't forget.<br>
            Like the strangers that you've met,<br>
            The ragged men in the ragged clothes,<br>
            The silver thorn of bloody rose,<br>
            Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow. <br>
            <br>
            Now I think I know what you tried to say to me,<br>
            How you suffered for your sanity,<br>
            How you tried to set them free.<br>
            They would not listen, they're not listening still.<br>
            Perhaps they never will. <br>
